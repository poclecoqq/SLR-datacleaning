# Extract_paper_name
This directory contains the code we used to pre-process the spreadsheets exported by Notion. The output of the script is a list of papers' name for the initial pool of paper and the snowballed ones.

**How to use**: 
- Export the spreadsheets from Notion and save them here, under the name `main.csv` and `snowballing.csv`
- Run `script.py`
