The radial blur is introduced in the image as an effect of ego motion in autonomous vehicle systems. The deblurring of the image with radial blur is challenging since most of the blur models do not estimate radial blur. Hence, we design a deep learning based pipeline with estimation and enhancement modules. The estimation module is designed with CuratorNet to estimate radial PSF in two stages. The estimated PSF is used for deblurring of input radial blurred images. The enhancement module is designed with convolutional autoencoder which enhances the deblurred image to remove artefacts in order to detect the traffic signs. We demonstrate the results of the proposed pipeline on synthetic and real images with traffic signs and compare the results with existing methods.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:09:41","2022-08-10 19:16:55","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies, CONECCT 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Bangalore, India","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT47791.2019.9012864","Deep learning; Pipelines; Error detection; Image enhancement; Traffic signs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The state-of-the art detectors are end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network based models that reach good mean average precisions, around 73%, on benchmarks of high quality images. However, these models still produce a large number of false positives in low quality videos such as, surveillance videos. This paper proposes a novel image fusion approach to make the detection model focus on the area of interest where the action is more likely to happen in the scene. We propose building a low cost symmetric dual camera system to compute the disparity map and exploit this information to improve the selection of candidate regions from the input frames. From our results, the proposed approach not only reduces the number of false positives but also improves the overall performance of the detection model which make it appropriate for object detection in surveillance videos.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:40","2022-08-10 19:05:11","","271-280","","","49","","Information Fusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2018.11.015","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Error detection; Security systems; Deep neural networks; Benchmarking; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Object detection; Object recognition; Mobile telecommunication systems; Image fusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such degradations yield a robust correlation and causality between single-event upset (SEU) induced errors in memory weights of on-orbit CNN implementations. However, minimal considerations have been given to how the resilience of CNNs can be improved algorithmically as opposed to via enhanced hardware. This paper focuses on RF-processing CNNs and performs an in-depth analysis of applying software-based error detection and correction mechanisms, which may subsequently be combined with protections of radiation-hardened processor platforms. These techniques are more accessible for low cost smallsat platforms than ruggedized hardware. Additionally, methods for minimizing the memory and computational complexity of the resulting resilience techniques are identified. Combined with periodic scrubbing, the resulting techniques are shown to improve expected lifetimes of CNN-based RF-processing algorithms by several orders of magnitude.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:43","2022-08-10 20:38:38","","5 pp.","","","","","","","2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC49221.2020.9297212","Machine learning; neural nets; learning (artificial intelligence); Computer networks; Convolutional neural networks; error detection; cellular neural nets; microprocessor chips; radiation hardening (electronics); space vehicle electronics; Computer hardware; Radiation hardening; Radio waves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we found these KGs to be surprisingly noisy. In this study, we question the quality of these KGs, where the typing error rate is estimated to be 27% for coarse-grained types on average, and even 73% for certain fine-grained types. In pursuit of solutions, we propose an active typing error detection algorithm that maximizes the utilization of both gold and noisy labels. We also comprehensively discuss and compare unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms to deal with typing errors in factual KGs. The outcomes of this study provide guidelines for researchers to use noisy factual KGs.

However, recent studies have revealed a novel molecular pathway where also serrated polyps can develop into colorectal cancer. CT colonography (CTC) can detect serrated polyps using the radiomic biomarker of contrast coating, but this requires expertise from the reader and current computer-aided detection (CADe) systems have not been designed to detect the contrast coating. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel CADe method that makes use of deep learning to detect serrated polyps based on their contrast-coating biomarker in CTC. In the method, volumetric shape-based features are used to detect polyp sites over soft-tissue and fecal-tagging surfaces of the colon. The detected sites are imaged using multi-angular 2D image patches. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used to review the image patches for the presence of polyps. The DCNN-based polyp-likelihood estimates are merged into an aggregate likelihood index where highest values indicate the presence of a polyp. For pilot evaluation, the proposed DCNN-CADe method was evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation scheme using 101 colonoscopy-confirmed cases with 144 biopsy-confirmed serrated polyps from a CTC screening program, where the patients had been prepared for CTC with saline laxative and fecal tagging by barium and iodine-based diatrizoate. The average per-polyp sensitivity for serrated polyps 6 mm in size was 937% at 0:81:8 false positives per patient on average. The detection accuracy was substantially higher that of a conventional CADe system. Our results indicate that serrated polyps can be detected automatically at high accuracy in CTC.  2017 SPIE.","2017","2022-08-10 17:40:34","2022-08-10 17:40:34","","Alpinion Medical Systems; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","","","10134","","","","Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE","","","","SPIE","Orlando, FL, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2255634","Deep learning; Computerized tomography; Error detection; Diseases; Deep neural networks; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Medical imaging; Convolution; Computer aided instruction; Transfer learning; Biomarkers; Coatings; Computer aided network analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, there are limitations such as error detection due to external factors, and there is also a disadvantage that it is difficult to accurately distinguish between various objects. This paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to recognize and classify object images of very small moths and obtain precise data images. A convolution neural network algorithm is used for image data classification, and the classified image is transformed into image data to learn the topological structure of the image. To improve the accuracy of the image classification and reduce the loss rate, a parameter for finding a fast-optimal point of image classification is set by a convolutional neural network and a pixel image as a preprocessor. As a result of this study, we applied a convolution neural network algorithm to classify the images of very small moths by capturing precise images of the moths.

The application in this problem of machine learning algorithms in combination with the use of textural features of the object is investigated. The proposed method includes two main steps: the classification of pixels and the detection of neuron centers. At the stage of classification using the k nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm determines the belonging of each pixel to the neuron's body. In the paper, 3 types of textural features were constructed, based on: a normalized histogram; structural tensor; their combination. To find the centers of neurons, all the pixels belonging to the neurons are clustered using the mean shift algorithm. The experiments showed that the best detection quality was achieved using combined textural features (histogram + structural tensor) with a radius of neighborhood R = 7 with the following quality indicators: recall = 0.77; precision = 0.79; F1 score = 0.78. On the data set under consideration, the choice of the parameter k> 15 does not significantly improve the detection quality. It is shown that kNN is the best classifier for the proposed detection algorithm in comparison with the Bayesian classifier (NBC) and the support vector machine (SVM).

It is an automated vision system designed and implemented using MATLAB. The Face Detection with Expression Recognition system accomplishes facial expression recognition through two phases. The captured image is processed first to detect the face, and then the facial expression is recognized. These two phases are completed in five stages. The first two stages of the system deal with detecting and cropping the face using image processing, in particular the Viola-Jones object detection framework. The third stage deals with converting the colors of the cropped image from RGB into gray scale and applying the appropriate smoothing filter. The fourth stage consists of feature extraction using Artificial Neural Networks, so as the extracted features are compared with training samples. The final stage classifies the given outputs and shows facial expression recognition results. It then determines whether the subject is happy, angry or in neutral state. The Artificial Neural Network uses Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) with back propagation algorithm for features extraction and classification. It has 4097 input nodes, one hidden layer with 50 neurons, and one output layer. Testing results show that this system can be used for interpreting three facial expressions: happiness, anger and neutral. It extracts accurate outputs that can be employed in other fields of studies such as psychological assessment. Finally, the high precision of the results allow future development of different applications which respond to spontaneous facial expressions in real time.  2016 IEEE.","2016","2022-08-10 17:40:36","2022-08-10 17:40:36","","115-119","","","2016-November","","","","Middle East Conference on Biomedical Engineering, MECBME","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Beirut, Lebanon","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MECBME.2016.7745421","Backpropagation; Error detection; Extraction; Object detection; Biomedical engineering; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Face recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Between normal and chill-damaged peaches, significant differences in fruit quality parameters and the spectral response to correlating selected wavelengths were observed. Evidencing this relationship, the correlation coefficients between quality parameters and the respective spectral response of eight selected wavelengths were -0.587 to -0.700, 0.393 to 0.552, 0.510 to 0.751, and 0.574 to 0.773.

For embedded systems, this complexity severely limits the opportunities to reduce power consumption, which is dominated by memory read and write operations. Anticipating the oncoming integration into intelligent sensor devices, we compare hand-crafted features for the detection of a limited number of objects against some typical convolutional neural network architectures. Experiments on some state-of-the-art datasets, addressing detection tasks, show that for some problems the increased complexity of neural networks is not reflected by a large increase in accuracy. Moreover, our analysis suggests that for embedded devices hand-crafted features are still competitive in terms of accuracy/complexity trade-offs.

However, its signals are easily affected by environment, vehicle type, installation location and moving neighboring vehicles. Besides, accidental installation also leads to non-unified coordinate of magnetic sensors which makes the management system difficult to recognize. To overcome these challenges, we proposed a novel semi-supervised and multi-task learning framework for sensor based on-street parking slot inference with three contributions. First, a Coordinate Transform Module is integrated into our framework to reduce the diversity of input signals by transforming them adaptively into a unified coordinate. Second, to learn the generalized and discriminative features while minimizing the amount of labeled data, we introduce a Multi-task Module to leverage the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Third, we embed a Temporal Module, which observes and memorizes the parking states from time to time, to infer parking space status in a reliable way. The experimental results show that, with the proposed three modules, our end-to-end training framework could reduce the error detection and hence improve the system accuracy.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:36","2022-08-10 17:40:36","","6 pp.","","","","","","","2019 International Conference on Multimedia Analysis and Pattern Recognition (MAPR)","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MAPR.2019.8743537","supervised learning; traffic engineering computing; image processing; magnetic sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a long standing problem due to low signal-to-noise ratio in the visualisation of breast masses, combined with their large variability in terms of shape, size, appearance and location. We break the problem down into three stages: mass detection, mass segmentation, and mass classification. For the detection, we propose a cascade of deep learning methods to select hypotheses that are refined based on Bayesian optimisation. For the segmentation, we propose the use of deep structured output learning that is subsequently refined by a level set method. Finally, for the classification, we propose the use of a deep learning classifier, which is pre-trained with a regression to hand-crafted feature values and fine-tuned based on the annotations of the breast mass classification dataset. We test our proposed system on the publicly available INbreast dataset and compare the results with the current state-of-the-art methodologies.

The study aims to explore the intelligent image processing methods based on football robots. First, the moving dynamic image is recognized and processed, and computer vision is proposed to simulate animal vision and collect static and dynamic images of football based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Second, a football robot platform is designed to process the collected graphic dataset. Finally, the feature vector and combination matrix of the image in the dataset are calculated, and the obtained feature matrix is input into AdaBoost to obtain the recognition result of football images. The experimental results show that the system error of the auxiliary recognition technology based on IoT is 0.63, and the detection error rate of the auxiliary recognition technology based on AdaBoost is negatively correlated with the number of features. It is concluded that the more training the samples receive, the smaller the detection error rate of the algorithm is. Compared with similar algorithms, the recognition accuracy of the designed algorithm in different datasets is more than 80.1%, and the recognition result is better than that of similar algorithms. Therefore, the algorithm designed and the results obtained prove the feasibility of the proposed intelligent recognition technology in football image recognition.

Exoplanet detection by direct imaging requires both dedicated instruments to mask out the host star and careful image processing methods. Data processing is challenging because the exoplanet signal is very faint and hidden in a much stronger non-stationary background displaying strong spatial correlations. In contrast to previous detection methods, we explicitly model the spatial correlations of the background and design a completely unsupervised method that accounts for the background non-stationarity. From a time series of observations, we learn a local model of the distribution of background patches. Significant sources are then detected with a generalized likelihood ratio test. The sub-pixel location and flux of each detected exoplanet are estimated jointly to a refining of the background model. Each detected source is removed from the data, following an orthogonal matching pursuit strategy. The stopping criterion is based on a control of false alarms.

"HXMKWUIQ","bookSection","2017","Ghesu, Florin C.; Georgescu, Bogdan; Hornegger, Joachim","Efficient Medical Image Parsing","","","","","","Fast and robust detection, segmentation and tracking of anatomical structures or pathologies support the entire clinical workflow enabling real-time guidance, quantification, and processing in the operating room. Most state-of-the-art solutions for parsing medical images are based on machine learning methods. While this enables the effective use of large annotated image databases, such techniques typically suffer from inherent limitations related to the efficiency in scanning high-dimensional parametric spaces and the learning of representative features for modeling the object appearance. In this context we present Marginal Space Deep Learning, a novel framework for volumetric image parsing which exploits both the strengths of efficient object parametrization in hierarchical marginal spaces and the representational power of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The system learns classifiers in clustered, high-probability regions of the parameter space capturing the appearance of the object under the considered pose transformations and shape variations, gradually increasing the dimensionality of the exploration space from translation (3D), translation-orientation (6D) to incorporating also the anisotropic scaling (9D) and shape variability (ND). During runtime the system uses the learned classifiers to exhaustively scan these spaces to select the most probable transformation parameters. As this implies a significant computational effort in the order of billions of scanning hypotheses we propose cascaded sparse adaptive neural networks, learning to focus the data sampling patterns of the networks on sparse, context-rich parts of the input, thereby considerably reducing the runtime and increasing the robustness of the system. While we show that this method significantly increases the performance of the state-of-the-art, we highlight its main limitation: the learning of the appearance model and the parameter scanning are completely decoupled as independent algorithmic steps. To address this we make a step toward human-like intelligent parsing, presenting an extension of the system that models the object appearance and the parameter search as a unified behavioral task for an artificial agent. As opposed to exhaustively scanning the parameter space, the system uses reinforcement learning to discover optimal navigation paths guiding the search to the optimal location. We show the initial performance of this approach on the detection of arbitrary landmarks in ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography data, with considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our future work is focused on extending this framework for generic image parsing.  2017 Elsevier Inc.

This necessitates reliable change detection methods in multitemporal PolSAR datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised change detection algorithm for multilook PolSAR data. In the first step of the method, the Hotelling-Lawley trace (HLT) statistic is applied to measure the similarity of two multilook covariance matrices. As a result of this step, a scalar test statistic image is generated. Then, in the second step, a generalized Kittler and Illingworth (K&I) minimum-error thresholding algorithm is developed to perform on the test statistic image and discriminate between changed and unchanged areas. The K&I thresholding algorithm is based on the generalized Gamma distribution for statistical modeling of change and no-change classes. The proposed methodology is tested on a simulated PolSAR data and two C-band fully PolSAR datasets acquired by the uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR and RADARSAT-2 SAR satellites. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm accurately discriminates between change and no-change areas providing detection results with noticeably lower error rates and higher detection accuracy values compared to those of a CFAR-type thresholding of the HLT statistic. Also, the performance of the HLT statistic compared to the other statistics applied on the multilook polarimetric SAR data is assessed. Goodness-of-fit test results prove that the estimated generalized Gamma class conditional models adequately fit the corresponding change and no-change classes. 2008-2012 IEEE.","2018","2022-08-10 17:40:38","2022-08-10 17:40:38","","4551-4562","","12","11","","IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2882412","Error detection; Statistical tests; Statistics; Land use; Antennas; Covariance matrix; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present and evaluate a deep learning-based method that includes pre-annotation of the phases and steps in surgical videos and user assistance in the annotation process. Methods We propose a classification function that automatically detects errors and infers temporal coherence in predictions made by a convolutional neural network. First, we trained three different architectures of neural networks to assess the method on two surgical procedures: cholecystectomy and cataract surgery. The proposed method was then implemented in an annotation software to test its ability to assist surgical video annotation. A user study was conducted to validate our approach, in which participants had to annotate the phases and the steps of a cataract surgery video. The annotation and the completion time were recorded. Results The participants who used the assistance system were 7% more accurate on the step annotation and 10 min faster than the participants who used the manual system. The results of the questionnaire showed that the assistance system did not disturb the participants and did not complicate the task. Conclusion The annotation process is a difficult and time-consuming task essential to train deep learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a method to assist the annotation of surgical workflows which was validated through a user study. The proposed assistance system significantly improved annotation duration and accuracy.","2020-04","2022-08-10 17:40:39","2022-08-10 17:40:39","","673-80","","4","15","","International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery","","Int.

In general, fully trained CNNs require substantial volumes of data, motivating several efforts to use transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs.

In the first methodology, classifier fusion techniques are also used. The performance of the first methodology was evaluated as a function of the number of landmine features, the environment, and the depth of the mine. In deep learning, a study was carried out based on the feature map, the type of landmine, and the environment. A quantitative analysis shows that traditional classifiers achieved an overall accuracy of above 97% in indoor and outdoor environments for the detection of landmines. The adopted deep learning methodology presented an increase in the performance for larger mines and a decrease for smaller ones.

However, the number of the proposal to ensure full coverage of potential objects is still large because the proposals are generated with thread and thrum, exposing proposal computation as a bottleneck. This paper presents a complementary technique that aims to work with any existing proposal generating system, amending the work-flow from ""propose-assess"" to ""propose-adjust-assess"". Inspired by the biological processing, we propose to improve the quality of object proposals by analyzing visual contexts and gradually focusing proposals on targets. In particular, the proposed method can be employed with existing proposals generation algorithms based on both hand-crafted features and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. For the former, we realize the focusing function by two learning-based transformation models, which are trained for identifying generic objects using image cues. For the latter, a Focus Proposal Net (FoPN) with cascaded layers, which can be directly injected into CNN models in an end-to-end manner, is developed as the implementation of focusing operation. Experiments on real-life image data sets demonstrate that the quality of the proposal is improved by the proposed technique. Besides, it can reduce the number of proposals to achieve high recall rate of the objects based on both hand-crafted features and CNN-features, and can boost the performance of state-of-art detectors.  2018","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:39","2022-08-10 17:40:39","","27-39","","","348","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2018.06.082","Deep learning; Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Object detection; Focusing; Image enhancement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, in order to avoid the computationally intensive coregistration of the hyperspectral data with other imaging modalities, the initially detected targets are projected through a local coordinate system on the hypercube image plane. Regarding the object detection, a detector-agnostic procedure has been developed, integrating both unsupervised (background subtraction) and supervised (deep learning convolutional neural networks) techniques for validation purposes. The detected and verified targets are extracted through the fusion and data association steps based on temporal spectral signatures of both target and background.

This paper aims to develop a robust, automated algorithm and system for detection and tracking of pupil centers of a user using a single visual camera and near-infrared (NIR) leds under dynamic driving circumstances. Our proposed pupil tracker consists of eye-nose detection, keypoint alignment, and tracking with NIR led on/off control depending on illumination conditions. Eye-nose detection, which utilizes an error reinforcement learning method for selecting best learning DB, generates facial sub-region boxes including eyes and nose. The error reinforcement learning method uses only a small fraction (less than 5%) of the training DB, while improving the detection rate. Based on the detected region, eye-nose alignment including pupil centers are then processed by Supervised Descent Method (SDM) with Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Then, the pupil centers are tracked with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and SIFT feature based tracking checker, which guarantees the aligned results contains pupil centers. This can be considered a different feature space and a strong classifier used in the eye-nose detection stage, such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and a set of weak classifiers (Adaboosting). However, the proposed pupil tracker cannot be applied under low light conditions. To achieve this, we add NIR leds and S/W functions to control the intensity of the NIR. After recognizing the contents of the pupil image, such as low light conditions, wearing eyeglasses or sunglasses, corresponding designated aligners are applied. We achieve fairly high detection rate (98%) and precise eye alignment (average error 2mm) even with challenging conditions, such as day and nighttime driving conditions.  2019, Society for Imaging Science and Technology","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:40","2022-08-10 17:40:40","","AutoSens","","","2019","","","","IS and T International Symposium on Electronic Imaging Science and Technology","","","","Society for Imaging Science and Technology","Burlingame, CA, United states","","","","","","","","Issue: 15","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2352/ISSN.2470-1173.2019.15.AVM-055","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Support vector machines; Error detection; Feature extraction; Alignment; Infrared devices; Augmented reality; Head-up displays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to reduce the log-average miss rate of the object under different illumination conditions, a new one-stage detector suitable for multispectral pedestrian detection is proposed. First, in order to realize the complementarity between the information flows of the two modalities in the feature extraction stage to reduce the object loss, a low-cost cross-modality feature complementary module (CFCM) is proposed. Second, in order to suppress the background noise in different environments and enhance the semantic information and location information of the object, so as to reduce the error detection of the object, an attention-based feature enhancement fusion module (AFEFM) is proposed. Thirdly, through the feature complementarity of color-thermal image pair and the multi-scale fusion of depth feature layer, the horizontal and vertical multi-dimensional data mining of parallel deep neural network is realized, which provides effective data support for object detection algorithm.

Such task is also complicated by the fact that the image receiving at the input of the recognition algorithm may be noisy or captured in low light conditions. The minimum size of a persons head in an image to be detected for is 1010 pixels. In the course of development, a dataset was prepared containing over 1000 labelled images of classrooms at BSTU n.a. V.G. Shukhov. The markup was carried out using a segmentation software tool specially developed by the authors. Three architectures of convolutional neural networks were trained for human head detection task: a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with clustering, the Faster R-CNN architecture and the Mask R-CNN architecture. The third architecture works more than ten times slower than the first one, but it almost does not give false positives and has the precision and recall of head detection over 90% on both test and training samples. The Faster R-CNN architecture gives worse accuracy than Mask R-CNN, but it gives fewer false positives than FCN with clustering. Based on Mask R-CNN authors have developed software for human head detection on a low-quality image. It is two-level web-service with client and server modules.

However, deep neural networks are known to be overconfident for abnormal data. Existing works directly design score function by mining the inconsistency from classifier for in-distribution (ID) and OOD. In this paper, we further complement this inconsistency with reconstruction error, based on the assumption that an autoencoder trained on ID data can not reconstruct OOD as well as ID. We propose a novel method, READ (Reconstruction Error Aggregated Detector), to unify inconsistencies from classifier and autoencoder. Specifically, the reconstruction error of raw pixels is transformed to latent space of classifier. We show that the transformed reconstruction error bridges the semantic gap and inherits detection performance from the original. Moreover, we propose an adjustment strategy to alleviate the overconfidence problem of autoencoder according to a fine-grained characterization of OOD data. Under two scenarios of pre-training and retraining, we respectively present two variants of our method, namely READ-MD (Mahalanobis Distance) only based on pre-trained classifier and READ-ED (Euclidean Distance) which retrains the classifier. Our methods do not require access to test time OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection algorithms. On a CIFAR-10 pre-trained WideResNet, our method reduces the average FPR@95TPR by up to 9.8% compared with previous state-of-the-art.  2022, CC BY-NC-ND.","2022","2022-08-10 17:40:40","2022-08-10 17:40:40","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.07459","Learning systems; Error detection; Deep neural networks; Semantics; Image reconstruction; Image classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, we devise a measure that distinguishes normal classifier behaviour from abnormal behavior that occurs in the case of a novelty. This will be evaluated by training a kNN classifier on normal brain tissue, applying it to images with an untrained pathology (white matter hyperintensities (WMH)), and determine if our measure is able to identify abnormal classifier behaviour at WMH locations. For our kNN classifier, behaviour is modelled as the mean, median, or q1 distance to the k nearest points. Healthy tissue was trained on 15 images; classifier behaviour was trained/tested on 5 images with leave-one-out cross-validation. For each trained class, we measure the distribution of mean/median/q1 distances to the k nearest point. Next, for each test voxel, we compute its Z-score with respect to the measured distribution of its predicted label. We consider a Z-score 4 abnormal behaviour of the classifier, having a probability due to chance of 0.000032. Our measure identified >90% of WMH volume and also highlighted other non-trained findings. The latter being predominantly vessels, cerebral falx, brain mask errors, choroid plexus. This measure is generalizable to other classifiers and might help in detecting unexpected findings or novelties by measuring classifier behaviour.  2016 SPIE.","2016","2022-08-10 17:40:40","2022-08-10 17:40:40","","Bruker; imXPAD; Modus Medical Devices Inc.; Poco Graphite; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","","","9784","","","","Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE","","","","SPIE","San Diego, CA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2216358","Brain; Classification (of information); Error detection; Tissue; Pathology; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image processing; Statistical methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability of small target recognition is improved by fusing residual network and feature pyramid network, and the target feature can be fully extracted in the shallow model, so that the efficiency of feature extraction is improved. Secondly, an improved non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm is added to solve the error detection problem caused by traditional algorithms.

This study innovatively proposes to use a homemade olfactory visualization sensor to realize the quantitative determination of fatty acid value during rice storage. First, based on GCMS analysis results, 14 porphyrins and one pH indicator were preliminarily selected to prepare an olfactory visualization sensor array for obtaining odor information of rice samples of different storage periods. Then, the ant colony optimization combined with back propagation neural networks (ACO-BPNN) was used to optimize the color components of the preprocessed array difference image to obtain the best combination of color components. Finally, a back propagation neural networks (BPNN) model was established based on the optimized color component combination, and the number of hidden layer nodes of the network was optimized by using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The results showed that the best BPNN model constructed on the color component numbers 41, 11 and 34, and the optimal topology of the network was 3-12-1. The correlation coefficient (RP) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the best BPNN model were 0.9715 and 0.4310 mg/100 g, respectively. The overall results demonstrate that it is feasible to use the homemade olfactory visualization sensor to detect fatty acid values during rice storage. In addition, the ACO-BPNN can find the best color components combination, which can effectively improve the detection accuracy and stability of the BPNN model, and also reduce the cost of preparing the olfactory visualization sensor array.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2022-08-10 17:40:41","2022-08-10 17:40:41","","","","","309","","Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2020.127816","Backpropagation; Error detection; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Visualization; Topology; Color; Ant colony optimization; Electronic nose; Fatty acids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these problems, a suspicious multi-object detection and recognition method based on the Multi-Path Extraction Network (MPEN) is proposed. In MPEN, You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 is used as the base network, and then the Multi-Path Feature Pyramid (MPFP) module and modified residual block distribution are proposed. MPFP is designed to output the deep network feature layers separately. Then, to distinguish similar objects more easily, the residual block distribution is modified to improve the ability of the shallow network to capture details.

In severe cases, it can trigger paralysis or death. The measurement of Cobb angle plays an essential role in assessing the severity ofscoliosis. Purpose: The aim of this paper is to propose an automatic system for landmark detection and Cobb angle estimation, which can effectively help clinicians diagnose and treatscoliosis. Methods: A novel hybrid framework was proposed to measure Cobb angle precisely for clinical diagnosis, which was referred as W-Transformer due to its w-shaped architecture. First, a convolutional neural network of cascade residual blocks as our backbone was designed. Then a transformer was fused to learn the dependency information between spine and landmarks. In addition, a reinforcement branch was designed to improve the overlap of landmarks, and an improved prediction module was proposed to fine-tune the final coordinates of landmarks in Cobb angles estimation. Besides, the public Accurate Automated Spinal Curvature Estimation (AASCE) MICCAI 2019 challenge was served as data set. It supplies 609 manually labeled spine anteriorposterior (AP) X-ray images, each of which contains a total of 68 landmark labels and three Cobb Anglestags. Results: From the perspective of the AASCE MICCAI 2019 challenge, we achieved a lower symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 8.26% for all Cobb angles and the lowest averaged detection error of 50.89 in terms of landmark detection, compared with many state-of-the-art methods. We also provided the SMAPEs for the Cobb angles of the proximal-thoracic (PT), the main-thoracic (MT), and the thoracic-lumbar (TL) area, which are 5.27%, 14.59%, and 20.97% respectively, however, these data were not covered in most previous studies. Statistical analysis demonstrates that our model has obtained a high level of Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9398 ((Formula presented.)), which shows excellent reliability of our model. Our model can yield 0.9489 ((Formula presented.)), 0.8817 ((Formula presented.)), and 0.9149 ((Formula presented.)) for PT, MT, and TL, respectively. The overall variability of Cobb angle measurement is less than 4 (Formula presented.), implying clinical value. And the mean absolute deviation (standard deviation) for three regions is 3.64 (Formula presented.) (4.13 (Formula presented.)), 3.84 (Formula presented.) (4.66 (Formula presented.)), and 3.80 (Formula presented.) (4.19 (Formula presented.)). The results of Student paired (Formula presented.) -test indicate that no statistically significant differences are observed between manual measurement and our automatic approach ((Formula presented.) -value is always (Formula presented.) 0.05). Regarding the diagnosis of scoliosis (Cobb angle (Formula presented.) 10 (Formula presented.)), the proposed method achieves a high sensitivity of 0.9577 and a specificity of 0.8475 for all spinalregions. Conclusions: This study offers a brand-new automatic approach that is potentially of great benefit of the complex task of landmark detection and Cobb angle evaluation, which can provide helpful navigation information about the early diagnosis ofscoliosis.  2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","2022","2022-08-10 17:40:41","2022-08-10 17:40:41","","3246-3262","","5","49","","Medical Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mp.15561","Error detection; Diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Correlation methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because the task of evaluating the quality of a generated image differs from deciding if an image is real or fake. A generated image could be perfect except in a single area but still be detected as fake. Instead, we propose a novel approach for detecting where errors occur within a generated image. By collaging real images with generated images, we compute for each pixel, whether it belongs to the real distribution or generated distribution. Furthermore, we leverage attention to model long-range dependency; this allows detection of errors which are reasonable locally but not holistically. For evaluation, we show that our error detection can act as a quality metric for an individual image, unlike FID and IS. We leverage Improved Wasserstein, BigGAN, and StyleGAN to show a ranking based on our metric correlates impressively with FID scores.

A Novel and Agile Framework for ASR-error Robust Intent Detection","","","23318422","10.48550/arXiv.2205.11008","","The past ten years have witnessed the rapid development of text-based intent detection, whose benchmark performances have already been taken to a remarkable level by deep learning techniques. However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors are inevitable in real-world applications due to the environment noise, unique speech patterns and etc, leading to sharp performance drop in state-of-the-art text-based intent detection models. Essentially, this phenomenon is caused by the semantic drift brought by ASR errors and most existing works tend to focus on designing new model structures to reduce its impact, which is at the expense of versatility and flexibility. Different from previous one-piece model, in this paper, we propose a novel and agile framework called CR-ID for ASR error robust intent detection with two plug-and-play modules, namely semantic drift calibration module (SDCM) and phonemic refinement module (PRM), which are both model-agnostic and thus could be easily integrated to any existing intent detection models without modifying their structures. Experimental results on SNIPS dataset show that, our proposed CR-ID framework achieves competitive performance and outperform all the baseline methods on ASR outputs, which verifies that CR-ID can effectively alleviate the semantic drift caused by ASR errors.  2022, CC0.","2022","2022-08-10 17:40:42","2022-08-10 17:40:42","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.11008","Deep learning; Error detection; Semantics; Human computer interaction; Speech recognition; Character recognition; Model structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A single ConvNet is trained to detect the presence of the anatomical structure of interest in axial, coronal, and sagittal slices extracted from a 3-D image. To allow the ConvNet to analyze slices of different sizes, spatial pyramid pooling is applied. After detection, 3-D bounding boxes are created by combining the output of the ConvNet in all slices.

The heart, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta were localized in chest CT scans, the left cardiac ventricle in cardiac CTA scans, and the liver in abdomen CT scans. Localization was evaluated using the distances between automatically and manually defined reference bounding box centroids and walls. The best results were achieved in the localization of structures with clearly defined boundaries (e.g., aortic arch) and the worst when the structure boundary was not clearly visible (e.g., liver).

Moreover, the entire error correction virtually always delivers the performance of the best non-attacked network, resulting in an mIoU of about 50% even under strongest attacks (instead of 1...2%), while keeping the performance on clean data at about original level (ca. 75.7%).","2020","2022-08-10 17:40:43","2022-08-10 17:40:43","","1348-58","","","","","","","2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW).

In recent years, vehicle detection based on deep learning has become a research hotspot. Although the deep learning method has made a significant breakthrough in vehicle detection precision, it will lead to high missed detection rate of small vehicle targets and rely on expensive computing resources in visual vehicle detection tasks, which is difficult to achieve in embedded real-time applications. Further analysis shows that the main reason for the above problems is that deep convolution neural network cannot reasonably prune network layer parameters, especially cannot reasonably utilize the shallow semantic information. On the contrary, a series of operations at the lower sampling layers will lead to the loss of vehicle information, especially for the small vehicle objects. Therefore, how to effectively extract and utilize the semantic information of small vehicle objects is a problem to be solved in this paper. On this basis, the problem of pruning network layer parameters reasonably was discussed. For the detection algorithm, on the one hand, based on visual analysis of receptive field of Tiny YOLOV3 network shallow layers, the use of shallow semantic information was enhanced by constructing a shallow feature pyramid structure, on the other hand, the shallow down sampling layer was replaced by convolution layer to reduce the semantic information loss of shallow network layers and increase the shallow layer features of vehicle objects to be extracted. Combine the above 2 aspects, the enhanced Tiny YOLOV3 network was proposed. For the tracking algorithm, because of the high frame rate of the vehicle-mounted camera, assuming that the vehicle objects in the adjacent frame moving uniformly without considering the image information, Kalman filter algorithm was used to track the vehicle target, and its observation position was estimated optimally. The proposed enhanced Tiny YOLO V3 network was trained by using 50 000 images collected by the on-board vehicle camera during the day and night. The training strategy included pre-training model, multi-scale training, batch normalization and data augment methods, which same as Tiny YOLOV3 network. On the vehicle Jetson TX2 embedded platform, 8 groups of comparative experiments were carried out with Tiny YOLOV3 model, including day and night traffic scenes. The experimental results showed that compared with Tiny YOLO V3 model,the mean precision rate of the enhanced Tiny YOLOV3 model proposed in this paper was improved by 4.6%, the mean detection error rate was reduced by 0.5%, the mean missing detection rate was reduced by 7.4%, and the mean time consumption was increased by 43.8 ms/frame without tracking algorithm. After adding the vehicle tracking algorithm, the mean precision rate was improved by 10.6%, the mean detection error rate was reduced by 1.2%, the mean missing detection rate was reduced by 23.6%, and the mean operation speed was 5 times faster than that of the Tiny YOLOV3 model, reaching 30 frame/s. The study provides an important guidance for embedded vehicle detection and tracking algorithm application in intelligent vehicles and advanced driving assistant systems.  2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Nevertheless, it is still lacking in the robustness, universality, and accuracy during the segmentation of tea buds images under natural light. Fortunately, deep learning can greatly contribute to the artificial extraction of features for higher accuracy of tea bud detection in recent years. However, the current detection of tea bud can also be affected by the light to a great extent. Thus, it is very necessary to establish a new model of tea bud detection with high robustness and low sensitivity for intelligent tea picking in a natural environment. A novel automatic detection model of tea buds was proposed using a regional brightness adaptive correction and deep learning, in order to improve the robustness under different light intensities. First, the Longjing 43 tea was taken as a research object to collect the images under various light intensities. A labelling software was then used to label for the ""V"" and ""I"" posture of one bud and one leaf. After that, a data enhancement was performed by adding the Gaussian noise and horizontal mirroring. Second, the RGB images were converted to the grayscale images, of which the gray values were averaged. Subsequently, the distribution of the Average Gray (AG) values and convolution feature diagram were utilized to classify the grayscale images under different illumination intensities. Specifically, three levels were obtained, including the low, medium, and high brightness, corresponding to the intervals [30, 90), [90, 170), and [170, 230], respectively. A gamma brightness adaptive correction was then performed on the images with high brightness using different sizes of partitioning. At last, the multiple models of tea buds detection using deep learning were trained on the same training and test set. The results showed that the YOLOv5+CSPDarknet53 presented an optimal performance of tea bud detection, with the detection precision of 88.2% and recall rate of 82.1%, compared with SSD+VGG16, Faster RCNN+VGG16, YOLOv3+Darknet53, and YOLOv4+CSPDarknet53 models. The precision of detection was improved by 4.8 percentage points after a detection suppression on the YOLOv5 model. Thus, there was much less phenomenon that the same target was boxed for several times. Moreover, the image features of tea buds were of high significance in the brightness intervals [30, 90) and [90, 170), indicating that there was a much fewer influence of the brightness adaptive correction on the detection of the images with the medium or low brightness. There was also a relatively lower contrast between the tea buds and old leaves in the high brightness images. Furthermore, the significance of tea buds was weakened with the deepening of network layers, indicating that the effective features of tea buds cannot be extracted so far. As such, the recall rate of bud detection was only 71.1% for the high brightness images, indicating a relatively high missing detection rate. More importantly, the recall rate of bud detection was promoted by 19.2 percentage points than before, particularly after 23 block and regional gamma adaptive brightness correction for the high brightness images. The testing of tea images under various light intensities demonstrated that the YOLOv5 detection model using a regional brightness adaptive correction achieved the detection precision of 92.4% and the recall rate of 90.4%, indicating high robustness and low sensitivity to light changes. Therefore, the finding can provide a promising theoretical basis for the intelligent tea-picking system under natural light conditions.  2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Furthermore, traditional machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) often fail to efficiently detect such attacks when corrupted datasets are used for IDS training. To face these challenges, this paper proposes a novel error-robust multidimensional technique for DDoS attack detection. By applying the well-known Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), initially, the average value of the common features among instances is filtered out from the dataset. Next, the filtered data are forwarded to machine learning classification algorithms in which traffic information is classified as a legitimate or a DDoS attack. In terms of results, the proposed scheme outperforms traditional low-rank approximation techniques, presenting an accuracy of 98.94%, detection rate of 97.70% and false alarm rate of 4.35% for a dataset corruption level of 30% with a random forest algorithm applied for classification. In addition, for error-free conditions, it is found that the proposed approach outperforms other related works, showing accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate of 99.87%, 99.86% and 0.16%, respectively, for the gradient boosting classifier.  2020 by the authors.

Document processing on a mobile device consists of document localization, perspective correction, localization of individual fields, finding words in separate zones, segmentation and recognition. While capturing an image with a mobile digital camera under uncontrolled capturing conditions, digital noise, perspective distortions or glares may occur. Further document processing gets complicated because of its specifics: layout elements, complex background, static text, document security elements, variety of text fonts. However, the problem of word boundaries localization has to be solved at runtime on mobile CPU with limited computing capabilities under specified restrictions. At the moment, there are several groups of methods optimized for different conditions. Methods for the scanned printed text are quick but limited only for images of high quality. Methods for text in the wild have an excessively high computational complexity, thus, are hardly suitable for running on mobile devices as part of the mobile document recognition system. The method presented in this paper solves a more specialized problem than the task of finding text on natural images. It uses local features, a sliding window and a lightweight neural network in order to achieve an optimal algorithm speed-precision ratio.

In this work, by intensive diagnosis experiments, we quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found the 'localization error' is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides, we also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors, analyze the issues they might bring, and propose three strategies. First, we revisit the misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center of the 3D object, which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy. Second, we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing technologies is almost impossible, while those samples will mislead the learned network. To this end, we propose to remove such samples from the training set for improving the overall performance of the detector.

Previously, wood pith location was approximated by applying image processing algorithms along with some geometric relations between the annual rings within a cross-sectional image of wood and its pith. This produces failed detection results if the wood stems deviate from a circular shape. In this paper, we propose employing YOLO (you only look once) object detection to a wood pith identification problem. The Tiny-YOLO network with 23 layers was trained using a transfer learning approach with 345 wood cross-sectional images with pith annotations. Different experiments with variable ratios between the training and testing datasets and training iterations were carried out to produce checkpoints and test against the testing datasets. We found that the minimum loss function which is commonly used to indicate the best trained model in other deep neural networks (DNNs) object detection is not effective for this application. Therefore, we used detection accuracy, to reflect the percentage of detectable piths while inferencing the trained model with its testing dataset and an average distance error, i.e., the average distances between the detected piths and their ground truths, as the accuracy measurement. The experimental result shows that a ratio of training and testing datasets of 70:30, at training iterations of 170,000, gives rise to the maximum detection value of 76.3% with a 16.6-pixel average distance error. Additionally, it produces only 25% average distance error; \frac{1034}{4176} with 50% standard deviation; \frac{2533}{5395}, compared to the state of the art non-DNN-based pith detection approach.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:44","2022-08-10 17:40:44","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2019 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence, TAAI 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Kaohsiung, Taiwan","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAAI48200.2019.8959823","Neural networks; Error detection; Deep neural networks; Statistical tests; Object detection; Object recognition; Network layers; Location; Transfer learning; Wood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, a smoothing operator is added on the original gradient operator to tackle the speckle noise of SAR images. And the number of image size and candidate proposals are reduced according the distribution of ships in SAR images. After these improvements, the region proposal method gets more accurate without additional computations. Then, a cascade Fast R-CNN detection framework is designed to detect ships fastly and accurately. Its front simple CNN is responsible for rejecting the obvious background regions, and the back complex CNN is responsible for conducting classification and regression for the high probability candidate regions.

These current solutions are expensive and require physical hardware to be attached to the cyclists during a race. This paper proposes a method to both detect when a track cyclist passes the lap line and identify the cyclist using a region convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and K-means clustering. This method aims to overcome several limitations of prior research by identifying multiple cyclists in a single frame, requiring only a single image to train per cyclist, and increasing identification accuracy by combining a neural network with K-means clustering. The proposed method uses the Mask R-CNN with COCO 2017 dataset and K-means clustering to train the detector with a single image of each cyclist. Cyclists are then able to be identified during a race. The method achieved an average identification accuracy of 95.1% with single image training. Multiple cyclists could be detected in an individual frame through the successful integration of a combined Mask R-CNN K-means detector. The primary limitation of the method is the reduction in identification accuracy for cyclists wearing similar coloured clothing. By using K-means clustering and RGB range thresholding, the cyclists may be mis-identified if the colours are too similar. Further research that would benefit this solution includes developing additional points-of-interest to identify cyclists and additional cameras with different angles for instances of total overlap between cyclists.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:45","2022-08-10 17:40:45","","","","","2019-December","","","","International Conference Image and Vision Computing New Zealand","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Dunedin, New zealand","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IVCNZ48456.2019.8961035","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; K-means clustering; Identification (control systems); Image processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach characterizes surveys using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of textural features. A histogram is generated for each mission by assigning textures to their Best Matching Unit (BMU) in the SOM. Mission difference is calculated as the chi-squared distance between two histograms. Using this difference measure, it is shown that the estimate of detector recall over the most textually similar surveys improves on the estimate over all surveys by a factor of 5.

Most of the previous state-of-The-Art methods were lack of ability in capturing features in long range. Recent methods applied dependency tree via dependency-bridge and attention-based graph. However, most of the automatic processing tools used in those methods show poor performance on Chinese texts due to mismatching between word segmentation and labels, which results in error propagation. In this article, we propose a novel character-level Chinese event extraction framework via graph attention network (CAEE). We build our model upon the sequence labeling model, but enhance it with word information by incorporating the word lexicon into the character representations. We further exploit the inter-dependencies between event triggers and argument by building a word-character-based graph network via syntactic shortcut arcs with dependency-parsing. The architecture of the graph minimizes error propagation, which is the result of the error detection of the word boundaries in the processing of Chinese texts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, we build a large-scale real-world corpus consisting of announcements of Chinese financial news without golden entities. Experiments on the corpus show that our approach achieves competitive results compared with previous work in the field of Chinese texts.  2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","2022","2022-08-10 17:40:45","2022-08-10 17:40:45","","","","4","21","","ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3494533","Backpropagation; Errors; Trees (mathematics); Natural language processing systems; Extraction; Graph neural networks; Syntactics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During esophagus examination, abnormalities are often overlooked due to the irregular shape, variable size, and the complex surrounding area which requires a significant effort and experience. In this paper, a novel deep learning model which is based on faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) is presented to automatically detect abnormalities in the esophagus from endoscopic images. The proposed detection system is based on a combination of Gabor handcrafted features with the CNN features. The densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNets) architecture is embraced to extract the CNN features providing a strengthened feature propagation between the layers and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. To address the challenges of detecting abnormal complex regions, we propose fusing extracted Gabor features with the CNN features through concatenation to enhance texture details in the detection stage. Our newly designed architecture is validated on two datasets (Kvasir and MICCAI 2015). Regarding the Kvasir, the results show an outstanding performance with a recall of 90.2% and a precision of 92.1% with a mean of average precision (mAP) of 75.9%. While for the MICCAI 2015 dataset, the model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art performance with 95% recall and 91% precision with mAP value of 84%.

An approach to deal with the lack of data and avoid overfitting is the application of data augmentation, a technique that generates new training samples from the original dataset by applying different kinds of transformations. Several tools exist to apply data augmentation in the context of image classification, but it does not exist a similar tool for the problems of localization, detection, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation that works not only with 2 dimensional images but also with multi-dimensional images (such as stacks or videos). Results: In this paper, we present a generic strategy that can be applied to automatically augment a dataset of images, or multi-dimensional images, devoted to classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation. The augmentation method presented in this paper has been implemented in the open-source package CLoDSA. To prove the benefits of using CLoDSA, we have employed this library to improve the accuracy of models for Malaria parasite classification, stomata detection, and automatic segmentation of neural structures. Conclusions: CLoDSA is the first, at least up to the best of our knowledge, image augmentation library for object classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation that works not only with 2 dimensional images but also with multi-dimensional images.  2019 The Author(s).","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:46","2022-08-10 17:40:46","","","","1","20","","BMC Bioinformatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2931-1","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Error detection; Semantics; Image segmentation; Image classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fully convolutional neural network (FCN) can train images end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel, realizing object detection, segmentation and classification in one single CNN structure. However, the original FCN is utilized by the natural object tasks, which can hardly maintain the precision degree required by the medical images. To further improve the detection precision and segment accuracy, we improve the FCN by fusing more pooling layers, because the deconvolution of higher convolution layers give the coarser segmentations and lower convolution layers generate detail contour. The experiment is based on LIDC-IDRI datasets. Tenfold cross-validation is used to train and evaluate the performance. The experiment shows that the detection precise and the fineness of segmentation ascend with the number of the fused pooling layers. The detection rate can be achieved as high as 0.931  0.042. Meanwhile, for the segmentation performance evaluation, the score of intersection over Union (IoU) is applied, reaching 0.628  0.065. And the overlap rate (i.e. the overlap percentage of the segment result compared with the original label) is also calculated.

The medical care of a patient with breast cancer is costly and, given the cost and value of the preservation of the health of the citizen, the prevention of breast cancer has become a priority in public health. Over the past 20 years several techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as mammography, which is frequently used for breast cancer diagnosis. However, false positives of mammography can occur in which the patient is diagnosed positive by another technique. Additionally, the potential side effects of using mammography may encourage patients and physicians to look for other diagnostic techniques. Our review of the literature first explored infrared digital imaging, which assumes that a basic thermal comparison between a healthy breast and a breast with cancer always shows an increase in thermal activity in the precancerous tissues and the areas surrounding developing breast cancer. Furthermore, through our research, we realized that a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) undertaken through infrared image processing could not be achieved without a model such as the well-known hemispheric model.

The simulation results show that this method can effectively realise the intelligent recognition of super-pixel colour multi-dimensional image information boundary, the recognition accuracy is higher, and the ability of image recognition and target detection is improved.

These UAV images are characterized by a very high spatial resolution (35 mm), and consequently contain an extremely high level of detail for the development of automatic detection algorithms. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage, a number of candidate tobacco plant regions are extracted from UAV images with the morphological operations and watershed segmentation. Each candidate region contains a tobacco plant or a nontobacco plant. In the second stage, a deep convolutional neural network is built and trained with the purpose of classifying the candidate regions as tobacco plant regions or nontobacco plant regions. In the third stage, postprocessing is performed to further remove the nontobacco plant regions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a UAV image dataset.

The proposed runway detection approach is two-stage modular where in the first stage the aerial image classification is achieved to find the existence of runway in that particular image. Later, in the second stage, the identified runways are localized using both conventional line detection algorithms and more recent deep learning models.

Therefore, it is important and necessary to detect the insulator state automatically and accurately. However, existing detection models with constant feature space have drawbacks for distinctive samples, and it is complex to extract insulator image features. Thus, a method for insulator state detection based on convolutional neural network and feedback mechanism is explored in this paper, which imitates the human cognition process with repetitive comparison and inference from simple to fine. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the insulator samples, the network structure of LeNet-5 is improved by employing stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) and the feedback mechanism, and the alternate optimization strategy is adopted to optimize the parameters of the convolution neural network. Secondly, based on the entropy theory, the semantic error entropy measurement index is established to evaluate the uncertainty of the insulator detection results in real time to overcome the posterior evaluation. Finally, according to the evaluation results of semantic error information entropy measurement index, the feedback mechanism is constructed to adjust the size and number of the convolution kernels to extract the refined features for the repeated comparison and inference.

The WCE video can effectively support physicians to reach a diagnostic decision while a huge number of images need to be analyzed (more than 50 000 frames per patient). In this paper, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis method called second glance (secG) detection framework for automatic detection of ulcers based on deep convolutional neural networks that provides both classification confidence and bounding box of lesion area. We evaluated its performance on a large dataset that consists of 1504 patient cases (the largest WCE ulcer dataset to our best knowledge, 1076 cases with ulcers, 428 normal cases). We use 15 781 ulcer frames from 753 ulcer cases and 17 138 normal frames from 300 normal cases for training. Validation dataset consists of 2040 ulcer frames from 108 cases and 2319 frames from 43 normal cases. For test, we use 4917 ulcer frames from 215 ulcer cases and 5007 frames from 85 normal cases. Test results demonstrate the 0.9469 ROC-AUC of the proposed secG detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection frameworks including Faster-RCNN (0.9014) and SSD-300 (0.8355), which implies the effectiveness of our method. From the ulcer size analysis, we find the detection of ulcers is highly related to the size. For ulcers with size larger than 1% of the full image size, the sensitivity exceeds 92.00%. For ulcers that are smaller than 1% of the full image size, the sensitivity is around 85.00%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 89.71%, 90.48% and 90.10%, at a threshold value of 0.6706, which implies the potential of the proposed method to suppress oversights and to reduce the burden of physicians.  2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:50","2022-08-10 17:40:50","","","","23","64","","Physics in Medicine and Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IOP Publishing Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab5086","Error detection; Diseases; Computer networks; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Endoscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It can accurately and efficiently detect the aircraft target from the remote sensing images which aim at ground reconnaissance. First of all, it can quickly acquire the intelligence of the enemy's military activities and provide support for the identification of the air target. Second, it can evaluate the importance of the military airport and analyze enemy's operational intentions, to achieve a precise strike against the enemy's aircraft targets. The existing aircraft detection method uses a single convolutional neural network to accomplish the whole process of feature extraction and recognition. It fails to effectively extract the characteristics of aircraft targets and ignore the scale differences of different aircraft. Thus, the recognition results are not accurate enough. Aiming at this problem, this paper uses the deep residual network to extract the characteristics of aircraft targets, studies and analyzes the size of different aircraft targets, and uses K-means to cluster different sizes. The cluster centers are representative aircraft sizes. Based on these representative sizes of the aircrafts, the Aircraft Targets Region Proposal Network (ATRPN) is proposed to synthesize the geometric characteristics of different aircraft. Based on the faster regional convolutional neural network detection framework (Faster R-CNN), taking the deep residual network and ARPPN as the front end and the candidate box generation network, the ATRPN R-CNN remote sensing image aircraft target detection method is proposed. This paper also establishes an aircraft target detection data set with uniform distribution, complete shape and rich aerial photography angle. After training the ATRPN R-CNN remote sensing image aircraft target detection method on the data set, the performance comparison experiment was carried out with the detection framework of Faster R-CNN and single network target multi-scale detection framework (SSD). The experimental results show that the detection method has higher detection accuracy in many different scenes including different aircraft targets.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:51","2022-08-10 17:40:51","","474-478","","","","","","","ICEIEC 2019 - Proceedings of 2019 IEEE 9th International Conference on Electronics Information and Emergency Communication","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Beijing, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEIEC.2019.8784637","Error detection; Feature extraction; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; K-means clustering; Remote sensing; Aircraft accidents; Aerial photography; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Reconnaissance aircraft; Training aircraft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mitigation is a cone-like structure etched into locations on large optics that have been chipped by the high fluence (energy per unit area) laser light. Sometimes the repair leaves a difficult to detect remnant of the damage that needs to be addressed before the optic can be placed back on the beam line. We would like to be able to automatically detect these remnants. We try Deep Learning (convolutional neural networks using features autogenerated from large stores of labeled data, like ImageNet) and find it outperforms ensembles of decision trees (using custom-built features) in finding these subtle, rare, incomplete repairs of damage. We also implemented an unsupervised method for helping operators visualize where the network has spotted problems. This is done by projecting the credit for the result backwards onto the input image. This shows regions in an image most responsible for the networks decision. This can also be used to help understand the black box decisions the network is making and potentially improve the training process.  2017 SPIE.","2017","2022-08-10 17:40:51","2022-08-10 17:40:51","","Technical Committee on Industrial Application of Image Processing (IAIP), The Japan Society for Precision Engineering; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","","","10338","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","SPIE","Tokyo, Japan","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2264000","Repair; Deep learning; Learning systems; Decision trees; Error detection; Process control; Trees (mathematics); Convolutional neural networks; Quality assurance; Labeled data; Inspection; Lasers; Optics; Vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing YOLOv3 is a network with fast speed and performance recently. Most surveillance system using CCD cameras simultaneously store images from cameras installed in multiple locations. In such an environment, the use of deep learning requires a method of detecting objects through a single inference engine in a plurality of image. If the inference engine hardware is used for each camera channel, the cost of building a surveillance system increases significantly. Therefore, in the field of surveillance systems, a network structure with a high detection speed is required even if the detection performance is slightly degraded. This paper proposes a method to increase the detection speed by reducing the existing YOLOv3 network Architecture. 53 feature extractors, Darknet-53, are reduced to 24 layers. Therefore, a total of 106 layers is reduced to 39. And 53 YOLOv3 box detection parts are reduced to 15 layers. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the WIDER FACE dataset and its own collected dataset, we compared the performance with the existing YOLOv3-tiny and YOLOv3. As a result, the result was 87.48% mAP improved by 19.55% compared to the conventional YOLOv3-tiny. And I got a slow result of 100.5 FPS speed than the existing speed. And Object De-identification technology has been applied according to the results of the detection box. Therefore, it is faster than YOLOv3, and it is similar to YOLOv3 detection accuracy, proving that it is better than YOLOv3-tiny in real time detection.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:51","2022-08-10 17:40:51","","","","","","","","","34th International Technical Conference on Circuits/Systems, Computers and Communications, ITC-CSCC 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","JeJu, Korea, Republic of","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITC-CSCC.2019.8793382","Monitoring; Deep learning; Neural networks; Computer circuits; Error detection; Security systems; Network architecture; Object detection; Engines; Speed; CCD cameras","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only a subset of the initially identified interest points results in true correspondences (inliers). In this paper, we seek a detector that finds the minimum number of points that are likely to result in an application-dependent 'sufficient' number of inliers k. To quantify this goal, we introduce the 'k-succinctness' metric. Extracting a minimum number of interest points is attractive for many applications, because it can reduce computational load, memory, and data transmission. Alongside succinctness, we introduce an unsupervised training methodology for interest point detectors that is based on predicting the probability of a given pixel being an inlier. In comparison to previous learned detectors, our method requires the least amount of data pre-processing. Our detector and other state-of-the-art detectors are extensively evaluated with respect to succinctness on popular public datasets covering both indoor and outdoor scenes, and both wide and narrow baselines. In certain cases, our detector is able to obtain an equivalent amount of inliers with as little as 60% of the amount of points of other detectors.

While such technologies can reduce the required time and amount of material, they require new methods to address long printing times and error identification in complex process structures. Such systems can be created using artificial intelligence (AI), such that operators can focus on supervising monitoring systems rather than the printing process and can decide upon preprocessed information. For the laser powder bed fusion process (LPBF), a main challenge lies in error detection per layer and in predicting the necessity of near-future operator interaction, to meet quality standards. Yet, only few works aim to automate the task of characterizing build layers. We propose an AI-driven approach to identify and forecast printing errors in LPBF using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) approach. For training and validation, layer wise greyscale images of 27 print jobs have been recorded. All print jobs' results were qualitatively rated afterwards by experts. We then perform an autoencoder-based clustering and compare print jobs of high and low quality to create pseudo-labels. We finally train a CNN in a supervised fashion to classify layers as succeeded or faulty, as well as a CPH model to estimate remaining build time without errors. We achieve an overall accuracy of 94.9% for the CNN and statistically significant forecasts (p  0.005) of the imposed hazard per layer using the CPH model. Our work demonstrates a novel approach of automated build part characterization, that reduces human operator effort and can be used for automated quality assurance and process monitoring.  2022 The Authors.

There are many possible appearances of product defects, including distortions in color, shape, contamination, missing or superfluous parts. For the detection of those, besides traditional image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks based methods have also appeared to avoid the usage of hand-crafted features and to build more efficient detection mechanisms. In our article we deal with autoencoder convolutional networks (AEs) which do not require examples of defects for training. Unfortunately, the manual and/or trial-and-error design of AEs is still required to achieve good performance, since there are many unknown parameters of AEs which can greatly influence the detection abilities. For our study we have chosen a well performing AE known as structural similarity AE (SSIM-AE), where the loss function and the comparison of the output with the input is implemented via the SSIM instead of the often used L1 or L2 norms. Investigating the performance of SSIM-AE on different data-sets, we found that its performance can be improved with modified convolutional structures without modifying the size of latent space. We also show that finding a model with low reconstruction error during training does not mean good detection abilities and denoising AEs can increase efficiency.  2021 University of West Bohemia.

Since many defects occur very rarely and their characteristics are mostly unknown a priori, their detection is still an open research question. To this end, we propose DifferNet: It leverages the descriptiveness of features extracted by convolutional neural networks to estimate their density using normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are well-suited to deal with low dimensional data distributions. However, they struggle with the high dimensionality of images. Therefore, we employ a multi-scale feature extractor which enables the normalizing flow to assign meaningful likelihoods to the images. Based on these likelihoods we develop a scoring function that indicates defects. Moreover, propagating the score back to the image enables pixel-wise localization.

The models have been developed to suit contemporary range imaging hardware based on a recently fabricated Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera with 64 x 64 pixel resolution. Being the first prototype of its kind, only a small data set has been collected so far which makes it challenging for training models. To bypass this hurdle, transfer learning is applied to the widely used VGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN), with supplementary layers added specifically to handle SPAD data. This classifier and the renowned Faster-RCNN detector offer benchmark models for comparison to a newly created 3D CNN operating on time-of-flight data acquired by the SPAD sensor. Another contribution of this work is the proposed shot noise removal algorithm which is particularly useful to mitigate the camera sensitivity in situations of excessive lighting. Models have been tested in both low-light indoor settings and outdoor daytime conditions, on eight objects exhibiting small physical dimensions, low reflectivity, featureless structures and located at ranges from 25m to 700m. Despite antagonist factors, the proposed 2D model has achieved 95% average precision and recall, with higher accuracy for the 3D model.  2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-08-10 17:40:54","2022-08-10 17:40:54","","APRS; Australian Government, Department of Defence, Defence Science and Technology Group; Canon Information Systems Research Australia Pty Ltd (CiSRA); IAPRO; IEEE; UNSW Canberra","","","","","","","2018 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications, DICTA 2018","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Canberra, ACT, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2018.8615877","Deep learning; Error detection; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Multilayer neural networks; Transfer learning; Image classification; Cameras; Aircraft detection; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Photons; 3D modeling; Avalanche diodes; Optical radar; Particle beams; Shot noise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers focused on studying various model architectures, such as Bayesian networks and deep learning methods, as well as on the analysis of different representations of the speech signal. Despite significant progress in recent years, existing CAPT methods are not able to detect pronunciation errors with high accuracy (only 60% precision at 40%-80% recall). One of the key problems is the low availability of mispronounced speech that is needed for the reliable training of pronunciation error detection models. If we had a generative model that could mimic non-native speech and produce any amount of training data, then the task of detecting pronunciation errors would be much easier. We present three innovative techniques based on phoneme-to-phoneme (P2P), text-to-speech (T2S), and speech-to-speech (S2S) conversion to generate correctly pronounced and mispronounced synthetic speech. We show that these techniques not only improve the accuracy of three machine learning models for detecting pronunciation errors but also help establish a new state-of-the-art in the field. Earlier studies have used simple speech generation techniques such as P2P conversion, but only as an additional mechanism to improve the accuracy of pronunciation error detection. We, on the other hand, consider speech generation to be the first-class method of detecting pronunciation errors. The effectiveness of these techniques is assessed in the tasks of detecting pronunciation and lexical stress errors. Non-native English speech corpora of German, Italian, and Polish speakers are used in the evaluations.

In order to ensure the assembly quality of the assembly and reduce the problems caused by the possibility of missing and misplaced due to manual errors in the manufacturing assembly. Therefore, a method based on convolutional neural network visual recognition for assembly quality of detection and trace is proposed. The images of the assembly units are collected by the industrial cameras. The pre-classification by AlexNet during testing can effectively avoid cross and error detection between assembly units with high similarity. Then, the Faster R-CNN convolutional neural network is used for transfer learning, the trained weight files can be used to perform multi-target detection on the equipment components, and the trained model enables accurate and efficient error detection in assembly. The quality traceability system can trace the source of the accident. The superposition application of two convolutional neural networks realizes the adaptive identification and the result of assembly detection of different types workpieces, which improves the detection efficiency and quality.

The use of the CNN approach requires large amounts of data to facilitate a complex end-to-end feature extraction and classification process. Within the context of X-ray security screening, limited availability of object of interest data examples can thus pose a problem. To overcome this issue, we employ a transfer learning paradigm such that a pre-trained CNN, primarily trained for generalized image classification tasks where sufficient training data exists, can be optimized explicitly as a later secondary process towards this application domain. To provide a consistent feature-space comparison between this approach and traditional feature space representations, we also train support vector machine (SVM) classifier on CNN features. We empirically show that fine-tuned CNN features yield superior performance to conventional hand-crafted features on object classification tasks within this context. Overall we achieve 0.994 accuracy based on AlexNet features trained with SVM classifier. In addition to classification, we also explore the applicability of multiple CNN driven detection paradigms, such as sliding window-based CNN (SW-CNN), Faster region-based CNNs (F-RCNNs), region-based fully convolutional networks (R-FCN), and YOLOv2. We train numerous networks tackling both single and multiple detections over SW-CNN/F-RCNN/R-FCN/YOLOv2 variants. YOLOv2, Faster-RCNN, and R-FCN provide superior results to the more traditional SW-CNN approaches. With the use of YOLOv2, using input images of size 544  544, we achieve 0.885 mean average precision (mAP) for a six-class object detection problem. The same approach with an input of size 416  416 yields 0.974 mAP for the two-class firearm detection problem and requires approximately 100 ms per image.

Currently, the crab processing industry is highly dependent on manual labor. However, there is great potential for vision-guided intelligent machines to automate the meat picking process. Studies show that the back-fin knuckles are robust features containing information about a crab's size, orientation, and the position of the crab's meat compartments. Our studies also make it clear that detecting the knuckles reliably in images is challenging due to the knuckle's small size, anomalous shape, and similarity to joints in the legs and claws. An accurate and reliable computer vision algorithm was proposed to detect the crab's back-fin knuckles in digital images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can localize rough knuckle positions with 97.67% accuracy, transforming a global detection problem into a local detection problem. Compared to the rough localization based on human experience or other machine learning classification methods, the CNN shows the best localization results. In the rough knuckle position, a k-means clustering method is able to further extract the exact knuckle positions based on the back-fin knuckle color features. The exact knuckle position can help us to generate a crab cutline in XY plane using a template matching method.

In this paper, we propose a recognition algorithm for explosion fault based on saliency detection, which uses the trained network model to extract the features. Then, we put the saliency maps into a self-organizing feature map (SOM) network and build the mathematical module via super pixel segmentation, contour detection and other image processing methods. The test shows that the algorithm can reduce the error that may be caused by manual analysis. It also demonstrates that the detection of the insulator and the recognition of explosion fault can effectively improve the efficiency and intelligence level.  2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:56","2022-08-10 17:40:56","","","","2","17","","International Journal of Wavelets, Multiresolution and Information Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: World Scientific","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219691319400083","Electric power transmission networks; Error detection; Feature extraction; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Multilayer neural networks; Conformal mapping; Self organizing maps; Fault detection; Image segmentation; Aircraft detection; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Antennas; Digital television; Electric lines; Explosions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of the main challenges are reaching high classification accuracy and reducing the annotation time of the images. To address these problems, we have created a fine-grained database using online vehicle marketplaces of Turkey. A pipeline is proposed to combine an SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model with a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to train on the database. In the pipeline, we first detect the vehicles by following an algorithm which reduces the time for annotation. Then, we feed them into the CNN model. It is reached approximately 4% better classification accuracy result than using a conventional CNN model. Next, we propose to use the detected vehicles as ground truth bounding box (GTBB) of the images and feed them into an SSD model in another pipeline. At this stage, it is reached reasonable classification accuracy result without using perfectly shaped GTBB. Lastly, an application is implemented in a use case by using our proposed pipelines which detects the unauthorized vehicles by comparing their license plate numbers and make & models. It is assumed that license plates are readable.

In this paper, an approach is proposed to detect cavities in X-ray astronomical images using our newly designed Granular Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) based classifiers. The raw data are firstly preprocessed to obtain images of the observed objects, i.e., galaxies or galaxy clusters. In each image, pixels are classified into three categories, (1) the faint backgrounds (BKG), (2) the cavity regions (CAV), and (3) the bright central gas regions (CNT). And the sample sets are then generated by dividing large images into subimages with a window size according to the cavities' scale. Since the number of BKG samples are far more than the other types, to achieve balanced training sets, samples from the major class are split into subsets, i.e., granule. Then a group of three-convolutional-layer granular CNN networks without subsampling layers are designed as the classifiers, and trained with the labeled granular sample sets. Finally, the trained GCNN classifiers are applied to new observations, so as to estimate the cavity regions with a voting strategy and locate them with elliptical profiles on the raw observation images. Experiments and applications of our approach are demonstrated on 40 X-ray astronomical observations retrieved from Chandra Data Archive (CDA). Comparisons among our approach, the -model fitting and the Unsharp Masking (UM) methods were also performed, which prove our approach was more accurate and robust.

This requires high bandwidth and high transmission delay, which limits the response speed of the system. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the system will use the embedded system mounted on the UAV for image processing and pattern recognition, which saves transmission bandwidth and shortens response time.

Exploring new applications for image processing techniques within the area of construction engineering and management is a steady growing field of research. One of the initial steps for various image processing applications is automatically detecting various types of construction materials on construction images. In this paper, the authors conducted a comparison study to evaluate the performance of different machine learning techniques for detection of three common categorists of building materials: Concrete, red brick, and OSB boards. The employed classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for building material detection. The results indicate that for all three types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate.  2016, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2016","2022-08-10 17:40:58","2022-08-10 17:40:58","","1178-1188","","4","20","","KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12205-015-0726-0","Learning systems; Support vector machines; E-learning; Error detection; Multilayer neural networks; Functions; Concretes; Image processing; Textures; Color; Multilayers; Brick; Building materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (>20 m3 ha1). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (3 ha1). We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Para northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.  2018 The Authors","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:58","2022-08-10 17:40:58","","569-582","","","221","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.044","Machine learning; Decision trees; Error detection; Random forests; Conservation; Textures; Ecosystems; Tropics; Degradation; Drought","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.  2019 by the authors.","2019","2022-08-10 17:40:59","2022-08-10 17:40:59","","","","11","11","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11111309","Deep learning; Learning systems; Neural networks; Error detection; Forestry; Deep neural networks; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Semi-supervised learning; Remote sensing; Optical radar; Biodiversity; Neon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Object detection in UAV images is one of the important techonlogies to analyze scene information. However, the UAV image includes small and dense targets, which easily leads to errors of missed detection. In this paper, we propose a dual neural network review method, which quickly screens the missed targets in the one-stage detection by classifying the secondary features of the suspected target regions, so as to achieve high quality detection of small targets. Firstly, the one-stage detector recognizes UAV images, and the result with confidence greater than or equal to the threshold is detected as the target. The result less than the threshold are considered as suspected areas containing missed targets. Secondly, the feature map of UAV image is extracted by VGG backbone. The feature map and the location information of the suspected areas are combined to secondary identification. Then, the features of the dual network are late fusion, and the re-identified results guide the initial confidence addition. After the addition, regions with confidence greater than the threshold are considered as targets. Finally, we synthesize the targets of initial detection and secondary identification to obtain the final detection results. Experimental results show that our method achieves breakthrough performance on VisDrone, UAVDT and MS COCO datasets.  2021","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:00","2022-08-10 17:41:00","","292-301","","","443","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.03.016","Error detection; Deep neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Aircraft detection; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Antennas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually, these tests are recorded in video and analysed afterwards to carry out manual annotations about the activity and behaviour of the rat. Usually, these videos must be watched repeatedly to ensure correct annotations, but they are prone to become a tedious task and are highly likely to produce human errors. Existing commercial systems for automatic detection of the rat and classification of its behaviours may become inaccessible for research teams that cannot afford the license cost. Motivated by the latter, we propose a methodology for simultaneous rat detection and behaviour classification using inexpensive hardware in this work. Our proposal is a Deep Learning-based two-step methodology to simultaneously detect the rat in the test and classify its behaviour. In the first step, a single shot detector network is used to detect the rat; then, the systems crop the image using the bounding box to generate a sequence of six images that input our BehavioursNet network to classify the rodents behaviour. Finally, based on the results of these steps, the system generates an ethogram for the complete video, a trajectory plot, a heatmap plot for most visited regions and a video showing the rats detection and its behaviours. Our results show that it is possible to perform these tasks at a processing rate of 23 Hz, with a low error of 6 pixels in the detection and a first approach to classify ambiguous behaviours such as resting and grooming, with an average precision of 60%, which is competitive with that reported in the literature.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2022-08-10 17:41:01","2022-08-10 17:41:01","","","","","","","","","Multimedia Tools and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12664-y","Deep learning; Error detection; Rats","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the development and training of a deep learning object detection model for automating the assessment of fiducial marker migration and tracking of the prostate in radiotherapy patients. Methods and Materials. A fiducial marker detection model was trained on the YOLO v2 detection framework using approximately 20,000 pelvis kV projection images with fiducial markers labelled. The ability of the trained model to detect marker positions was validated by tracking the motion of markers in a respiratory phantom and comparing detection data with the expected displacement from a reference position. Marker migration was then assessed in 14 prostate radiotherapy patients using the detector for comparison with previously conducted studies. This was done by determining variations in intermarker distance between the first and subsequent fractions in each patient. Results. On completion of training, a detection model was developed that operated at a 96% detection efficacy and with a root mean square error of 0.3 pixels. By determining the displacement from a reference position in a respiratory phantom, experimentally and with the detector it was found that the detector was able to compute displacements with a mean accuracy of 97.8% when compared to the actual values. Interfraction marker migration was measured in 14 patients and the average and maximum  standard deviation marker migration were found to be 2.00.9mm and 2.30.9mm, respectively. Conclusion. This study demonstrates the benefits of pairing deep learning object detection, and image-guided radiotherapy and how a workflow to automate the assessment of organ motion and seed migration during prostate radiotherapy can be developed. The high detection efficacy and low error make evident the advantages of using a pre-trained model to automate the assessment of the target volume positional variation and the migration of fiducial markers between fractions.  2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2022","2022-08-10 17:41:01","2022-08-10 17:41:01","","","","3","8","","Biomedical Physics and Engineering Express","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IOP Publishing Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2057-1976/ac34da","Deep learning; Error detection; Mean square error; Object detection; Object recognition; Radiotherapy; Phantoms; Urology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper constructs a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning to perform piston error sensing on a single focal plane image. First, a batch of data sets that introduce piston error generates according to the principle of sparse aperture imaging. The image features are extracted through the pre-training network, and the mapping relationship between the features and the corresponding piston error values is established. When a given single image is sent to the network for processing, then get corresponding piston error value via search with the nearest neighbors. The simulation results verify the method's effectiveness and measure the piston error of the 1 dynamic range. Because this detection method can perform piston error sensing tasks without introducing additional measuring equipment, it dramatically reduces the complexity and hardware cost of the optical system.

The manual localization is the time consuming and the tedious task for the observer. Therefore, we proposes a method to automatically detect cephalometric landmarks on lateral cephalometric x-ray image. The proposed method is a deep learning approach where centroid based registration was performed on the same size images then ResNet50 was applied on the different patches which were made based on the geometrical position of the landmarks. Total ten patches were made for the 19 landmarks. The average landmark detection rate during the testing was achieved as 90.39% and 92.37% under 2-mm and 3-mm error respectively for testset1 database. The average landmark detection rate during the testing was achieved as 82.66% and 84.53% under 2-mm and 3-mm error respectively for testset2 database.

The overall size was 470 mm600 mm615 mm. Walnuts from Zhejiang Province and impurities, including leaves, stones, paper, screws and fabric were photographed as detection objects by industrial camera above the production line in real time for intuitive image information data. An image segmentation technology combined with deep learning and computer vision, and the fully convolutional network (FCN) algorithm were applied to detect impurities that might occur in walnut production and processing. According to the test, the accuracy for detection and classification of walnut and foreign body was effective, which was 92.75% of training set and 90.35% of testing set. The speed of production line was 1 m/s. The recognition speed of detecting was 4.28 f/s, which can meet the requirements of real-time detecting of impurities. The biggest error was in the ""walnut-background"", where original walnut was predicted to be the background. The main reason was that some features in walnuts (such as cracks and lines) were similar to the background. Focusing on the analysis of foreign body error, it showed that impurities were mis-predicted as the ""background"" much more than the impurities were mis-predicted as the ""walnut"". Two main reasons led to this difference. On the one hand, when labelling manually, the pollutants on the conveyor belt were not judged as foreign bodies. On the other hand, because the size of impurities was generally small and the cardinality of pixel points was insufficient, the influence of false prediction was greater, thus amplifying the error. The reliability of the model was good. Even if the artificial labeling error occurred, walnut was mislabeled as impurities, but the trained model could still distinguish walnut and adjacent impurities well. The method proposed was worthy of further study for the online detection of impurities in automatic production of walnut, and it was of great significance to broaden the market of nut food and improve its economic benefits.  2022, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Cyber criminals are always looking for effective vectors to deliver malware to victims in order to launch an attack. Images are used on a daily basis by millions of people around the world, and most users consider images to be safe for use; however, some types of images can contain a malicious payload and perform harmful actions. JPEG is the most popular image format, primarily due to its lossy compression. It is used by almost everyone, from individuals to large organizations, and can be found on almost every device (on digital cameras and smartphones, websites, social media, etc.). Because of their harmless reputation, massive use, and high potential for misuse, JPEG images are used by cyber criminals as an attack vector. While machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting known and unknown malware in various domains, to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods have not been used particularly for the detection of malicious JPEG images. In this paper, we present MalJPEG, the first machine learning-based solution tailored specifically at the efficient detection of unknown malicious JPEG images. MalJPEG statically extracts 10 simple yet discriminative features from the JPEG file structure and leverages them with a machine learning classifier, in order to discriminate between benign and malicious JPEG images. We evaluated MalJPEG extensively on a real-world representative collection of 156,818 images which contains 155,013 (98.85%) benign and 1,805 (1.15%) malicious images. The results show that MalJPEG, when used with the LightGBM classifier, demonstrates the highest detection capabilities, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.997, true positive rate (TPR) of 0.951, and a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.004.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-08-10 17:41:03","2022-08-10 17:41:03","","19997-20011","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2969022","Machine learning; Learning systems; Error detection; Network security; Crime; Malware","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most piston detection methods based on neural networks are difficult to achieve high accuracy. In this Letter, we propose a high-precision piston error detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). A system with six sub-mirrors is used, and one of the sub-mirrors is set as the reference mirror. The network can simultaneously extract the piston information of the remaining five sub-mirrors to be tested from the point spread function (PSF). In the training phase, five sub-mirrors are set with 10,000 groups of random piston values with a range slightly less than one wavelength, and PSF images can be acquired accordingly. Then, 10,000 PSF images with corresponding piston errors are used to train the network. After training, we only need to input a PSF image into the pre-trained network, and the piston can be obtained directly. It is verified by simulation that the average piston's measurement error of five submirrors is just 0.0089 RMS (=632nm). In addition, this end-to-end method based on deep learning extremely reduces the complexity of the optical system, and just need to set a mask with a sparse multi-subaperture configuration in the conjugate plane of the segmented mirror. This method is accurate and fast, and can be widely used to detect the piston in phasing telescope arrays or segmented mirrors.  2021 SPIE","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:04","2022-08-10 19:20:11","","Chinese Society for Optical Engineering (CSOE); Science and Technology on Low-light-level Night Vision Laboratory","","","11763","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","SPIE","Kunming, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2587641","Deep learning; Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Telescopes; Optical transfer function; Pistons; Mirrors; Optical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study demonstrates the feasibility of a fully automatic method for detecting the aortic root, which is a key anatomical landmark in this type of procedure. The approach is based on the use of deep learning techniques that attempt to mimic expert behavior. Methods: A total of 69 CTA scans (39 for training and 30 for validation) with different pathology types were selected to train the network. Furthermore, a total of 71 CTA scans were selected independently and applied as the test set to assess their performance. Results: The accuracy was evaluated by comparing the locations marked by the method with benchmark locations (which were manually marked by two experts). The interobserver error was 4.6  2.3 mm. On an average, the differences between the locations marked by the two experts and those detected by the computer were 6.6  3.0 mm and 6.8  3.3 mm, respectively, when calculated using the test set.

The use of geographic information systems (GIS) and orthophoto maps can help to handle this task. One of the great difficulties they face is related to the continuous and quick changes that the territory suffers, and whose inspection is challenging to support. An example of this is the maintenance of the swimming pool registration system, in order to validate or license them. Indeed, it requires a substantial manual intervention, yet. This paper describes a system prototype for helping on detecting swimming pools on aerial images. It explores and integrates artificial intelligence (AI), systems integration, GIS, and data visualization. The AI improves the detection of objects, and middleware supports the integration of the detection results with other municipality systems for georeferencing and private property data licensing data crossing. To the innovative interoperability services, visualization libraries were explored, and an advanced visualization and analysis system was constructed.

In this study, a pre-processing technique has been proposed to improve the classification accuracy of WCE images into bleeding areas and normal areas by enhancing the WCE images. The proposed technique is applied to WCE images from six cases and divided into one training case and five test cases. To evaluate the effectiveness of the processes, the results were then compared between DCNN, SVM and Fuzzy, and also between DCNN with completely enhanced images and DCNN with normalized images. DCNN has shown to give a better result compared to SVM and Fuzzy logic; and the latter experiment has shown that the WCE images that have undergone the proposed enhancement technique gives better classification result compared to those images that did not go through the technique. The specificity, sensitivity and average are 0.8703, 0.8271 and 0.8907 respectively.

Accordingly, some powerful defense techniques were proposed. However, existing defense techniques often require modifying the target model or depend on the prior knowledge of attacks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method for detecting adversarial image examples, which can be directly deployed into unmodified off-the-shelf DNN models. We consider the perturbation to images as a kind of noise and introduce two classic image processing techniques, scalar quantization and smoothing spatial filter, to reduce its effect. The image entropy is employed as a metric to implement an adaptive noise reduction for different kinds of images. Consequently, the adversarial example can be effectively detected by comparing the classification results of a given sample and its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks. More than 20,000 adversarial examples against some state-of-the-art DNN models are used to evaluate the proposed method, which are crafted with different attack techniques. The experiments show that our detection method can achieve a high overall F1 score of 96.39 percent and certainly raises the bar for defense-aware attacks.  2020 IEEE.","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:04","2022-08-10 17:41:04","","72-85","","1","18","","IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2018.2874243","Noise abatement; Neural networks; Error detection; Deep neural networks; Network security; Personnel training; Entropy; Image processing; Image denoising; Perturbation techniques; Spurious signal noise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various modern architectures of deep neural networks for the simultaneous object detection and classification were studied, including Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet. To increase the efficiency of neural network recognition of objects in a video sequence, the Seq-BBox Matching algorithm is used. Training and testing of the proposed approach was carried out on Russian Traffic Sign Dataset and IceVision Dataset containing over 150 types of road signs and more than 65,000 marked images. For all the approaches considered, quality metrics are defined: mean average precision mAP, mean average recall mAR and processing time of one frame. The highest quality performance was demonstrated by the architecture of Faster R-CNN with Seq-BBox Matching, while the highest performance is provided by the architecture of RetinaNet. Implementation was carried out using the Python 3.7 programming language and PyTorch deep learning library using NVidia CUDA technology.

In this paper, we conduct a benchmark experimental study to assess the effectiveness of backdoor attacks against deep neural network (DNN) classifiers for images (CIFAR-10 domain), as well as of anomaly detection defenses against these attacks, assuming the defender has access to the (poisoned) training set. We also propose a novel defense scheme (cluster impurity (CI)) based on two ideas: I) backdoor patterns may cluster in a DNN's (e.g. penultimate) deep layer latent space; ii) image filtering (or additive noise) may remove the backdoor patterns, and thus alter the class decision produced by the DNN. We demonstrate that largely imperceptible single-pixel backdoor attacks are highly successful, with no effect on classifier usability. However, the CI approach is highly effective at detecting these attacks, and more successful than previous backdoor detection methods.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:05","2022-08-10 17:41:05","","","","","2019-October","","","","IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, MLSP","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Pittsburgh, PA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2019.8918908","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Neural networks; Error detection; Signal processing; Deep neural networks; Network security; Additive noise; Removal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digitizing pathology is a current trend that provides large amounts of visual data allowing a faster and more precise diagnosis through the development of automatic image analysis techniques. Recent studies have shown promising results for the automatic analysis of cancer tissue by using deep learning strategies that automatically extract and organize the discriminative information from the data. This paper explores deep learning methods for the automatic analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin stained histological images of breast cancer and lymphoma. In particular, a deep learning approach is proposed for two different use cases: the detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in breast histological images and the classification of lymphoma sub-types. Both use cases have been addressed by adopting a residual convolutional neural network that is part of a convolutional autoencoder network (i.e., FusionNet). The performances have been evaluated on the public datasets of digital histological images and have been compared with those obtained by using different deep neural networks (UNet and ResNet). Additionally, comparisons with the state of the art have been considered, in accordance with different deep learning approaches.

However, it remains difficult to detect and recognize the nodules due to low contrast, high noise, and diverse appearance of nodules. In today's clinical practice, senior doctors could pinpoint nodules by analyzing global context features, local geometry structure, and intensity changes, which would require rich clinical experience accumulated from hundreds and thousands of nodule case studies. To alleviate doctors' tremendous labor in the diagnosis procedure, we advocate a machine learning approach to the detection and recognition tasks in this paper. In particular, we develop a multitask cascade convolution neural network (MC-CNN) framework to exploit the context information of thyroid nodules. It may be noted that our framework is built upon a large number of clinically confirmed thyroid ultrasound images with accurate and detailed ground truth labels. Other key advantages of our framework result from a multitask cascade architecture, two stages of carefully designed deep convolution networks in order to detect and recognize thyroid nodules in a pyramidal fashion, and capturing various intrinsic features in a global-to-local way. Within our framework, the potential regions of interest after initial detection are further fed to the spatial pyramid augmented CNNs to embed multiscale discriminative information for fine-grained thyroid recognition. Experimental results on 4309 clinical ultrasound images have indicated that our MC-CNN is accurate and effective for both thyroid nodules detection and recognition. For the correct diagnosis rate of malignant and benign thyroid nodules, its mean Average Precision (mAP) performance can achieve up to 98.2 accuracy, which outperforms the common CNNs by 5 on average. In addition, we conduct rigorous user studies to confirm that our MC-CNN outperforms experienced doctors, yet only consuming roughly 2 (1/48) of doctors' examination time on average. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of our new method exhibit its great potential in clinical applications.  2013 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:08","2022-08-10 17:41:08","","1215-1224","","3","23","","IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2018.2852718","Neural networks; Error detection; Convolution; Ultrasonic applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The biggest challenge in adopting deep learning methods for drone detection is the paucity of training drone images especially thermal drone images. To address this issue, we develop two data augmentation techniques. One is a model-based drone augmentation technique that automatically generates visible drone images with a bounding box label on the drone's location. The other is exploiting an adversarial data augmentation methodology to create thermal drone images. To track a small flying drone, we utilize the residual information between consecutive image frames. Finally, we present an integrated detection and tracking system that outperforms the performance of each individual module containing detection or tracking only.

This lack of understanding is, in part, due to the difficulties in accurately identifying icebergs in different environmental conditions. To improve the understanding, reliable iceberg detection tools are necessary to achieve a detailed picture of iceberg drift and disintegration patterns, an thus to gain further information on the freshwater input into the Southern Ocean. Here, we present an accurate automatic large-scale iceberg detection method using an alternative machine learning architecture applied to high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Our method is based on the concept of adaptability and focuses on improving the performance of identifying icebergs in ambiguous environmental contexts with wide radiometric, textural, size and shape variability. The fundamentals of the method are centred on superpixel segmentation, ensemble learning and incremental learning. The method is applied to a dataset containing 586 ENVISAT Advanced SAR images acquired during 20032005 (Weddell Sea region) and to the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) mosaic, covering the Antarctic wide near-coastal zone. These images cover scenes under heterogenous backscattering signatures for all seasons with variable meteorological, oceanographic and acquisition parameters (e.g. band, polarization). Our method is highly adaptable to distinguish icebergs from ambiguous objects hidden in the images. The average false positive rate and miss rate are 2.3  0.4% and 3.3  0.4%, respectively. Overall, 9512 icebergs with sizes varying from 0.1 to 4567.82 km2 are detected with average classification accuracy of 97.5  0.6%.

Our key insight is to learn data augmentation policies from the noisy input dataset in a weakly supervised manner.

We compare our approach to a comprehensive collection of error detection methods, ranging from traditional rule-based methods to ensemble-based and active learning approaches. We show that data augmentation yields an average improvement of 20 F1 points while it requires access to 3 fewer labeled examples compared to other ML approaches.

To solve these problems, we propose an unsupervised network for cloud detection (UNCD) on multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing images. The UNCD method enforces discriminative feature learning to obtain the residual error between the original input and the background in deep latent space, which is based on the observation that clouds are sparse and modeled as sparse outliers in remote sensing imagery. The UNCD enforces discriminative feature learning to obtain the residual error between the original input and the background in deep latent space, which is based on the observation that clouds are sparse and modeled as sparse outliers in remote sensing imagery. First, a compact representation of the original imagery is obtained by a latent adversarial learning constrained encoder. Meanwhile, the majority class with sufficient samples (i.e., background pixels) is more accurately reconstructed than the clouds with limited samples by the decoder. An image discriminator is used to prevent the generalization of out-of-class features caused by latent adversarial learning. To further highlight the background information in the deep latent space, a multivariate Gaussian distribution is introduced. In particular, the residual error with clouds highlighted and background samples suppressed is applied in the cloud detection in deep latent space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed UNCD method, experiments were conducted on both MS and HS datasets that were captured by various sensors over various scenes, and the results demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. The sensors that captured the datasets include Landsat 8, GaoFen-1 (GF-1), and GaoFen-5 (GF-5). Landsat 8 was launched at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on 11 February 2013, in a mission that was initially known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). China launched the GF-1 satellite. The GF-5 satellite captures hyperspectral observations in the Chinese Key Projects of High-Re solution Earth Observation System. The overall accuracy (OA) values for Images I and II from the Landsat 8 dataset were 0.9526 and 0.9536, respectively, and the OA values for Images III and IV from the GF-1 wide field of view (WFV) dataset were 0.9957 and 0.9934, respectively. Hence, the proposed method outperformed the other considered methods.  2020 by the authors.","2020","2022-08-10 17:41:09","2022-08-10 17:41:09","","","","3","12","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12030456","Machine learning; Error detection; Clustering algorithms; Statistics; Gaussian distribution; Remote sensing; Image segmentation; Space optics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is very important to analyze and understand the meaning of words. Compared with the general visual elements, the text conveys rich and high-level moral information, which enables the computer to better understand the semantic content of the text. With the rapid development of computer technology, great achievements have been made in text information detection and recognition. However, when dealing with text characters in natural scene images, there are still some limitations in the detection and recognition of natural scene images. Because natural scene image has more interference and complexity than text, these factors make the detection and recognition of natural scene image text face many challenges. To solve this problem, a new text detection and recognition method based on depth convolution neural network is proposed for natural scene image in this paper. In text detection, this method obtains high-level visual features from the bottom pixels by ResNet network, and extracts the context features from character sequences by BLSTM layer, then introduce to the idea of faster R-CNN vertical anchor point to find the bounding box of the detected text, which effectively improves the effect of text object detection. In addition, in text recognition task, DenseNet model is used to construct character recognition based on Kares. Finally, the output of Softmax is used to classify each character. Our method can replace the artificially defined features with automatic learning and context-based features. It improves the efficiency and accuracy of recognition, and realizes text detection and recognition of natural scene images. And on the PAC2018 competition platform, the experimental results have achieved good results.  2019 Tech Science Press.

Automatic detection of coal and gangue is the key and foundation for the separation of coal and gangue. In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical framework for coal and gangue detection based on deep learning models. In this framework, the Gaussian pyramid principle is first used to construct multi-level training data, leading to the sets of coal and gangue image features with multiple scales. Then, the coal and gangue regional proposal networks (CG-RPN) are designed to determine the candidate regions of the target objects in the image. Next, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are constructed to recognize coal and gangue objects on the basis of extracted candidate regions. We performed our method on three different datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy of coal and gangue objects by 0.8% compared with the previous methods, reaching up to 98.33%.

And the detection and identification of welded joints are the premise of welding quality detection, which could reduce the quality detection range and improve the detection precision. Welded joint identification is also important for providing information for automatic control of welding process. Faced with the complex characteristics of industrial environment, such as weak texture, weak contrast and corrosion, we propose a detection and identification method of welded joints based on deep neural network. Firstly, aimed at the problem of insufficient training samples, combined with image processing and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), the high-quality training samples are generated. Secondly, the updating mechanism of training samples is established to guarantee that the deep neural network model could cover all samples. Finally, the detection and identification of welded joints are realized by the deep neural network which could avoid the handcrafted features of conventional machine learning methods.

CNN inference applications have been deployed in safety-critical systems, which may suffer from soft errors caused by high-energy particles, high temperature, or abnormal voltage. Of critical importance is ensuring the stability of the CNN inference process against soft errors. Traditional fault tolerance methods are not suitable for CNN inference because error-correcting code is unable to protect computational components, instruction duplication techniques incur high overhead, and existing algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques cannot protect all convolution implementations. In this article, we focus on how to protect the CNN inference process against soft errors as efficiently as possible, with the following three contributions. (1) We propose several systematic ABFTschemes based on checksum techniques and analyze their fault protection ability and runtime thoroughly. Unlike traditional ABFT based on matrix-matrix multiplication, our schemes support any convolution implementations. (2) We design a novel workflow integrating all the proposed schemes to obtain a high detection/correction ability with limited total runtime overhead. (3) We perform our evaluation using ImageNet with well-known CNN models including AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-18, and YOLOv2.

Firstly, with increasing resolution, the Dropout method of the full connection layer is cancelled, such that the increased selection of the crack information is fulfilled. Secondly, the whole network is carried out in a progressive manner by deepening the network depth of the FCN network. Finally, deconvolution layer in higher scale is added to extend the local fine detail based on the constructed network.

Here we consider Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which can be employed to detect surface deformation with a strong statistical link to eruption. Recent developments in technology as well as improved computational power have resulted in unprecedented quantities of monitoring data, which can no longer be inspected manually. The ability of machine learning to automatically identify signals of interest in these large InSAR datasets has already been demonstrated, but data-driven techniques, such as convolutional neutral networks (CNN) require balanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to effectively differentiate between real deformation and noise. As only a small proportion of volcanoes are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine learning for detecting volcanic unrest is more challenging than many other applications. In this paper, we address this problem using synthetic interferograms to train the AlexNet CNN. The synthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns based on a Monte Carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2) stratified atmospheric effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent atmospheric effects based on statistical simulations of correlated noise. The AlexNet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms that trained using real interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive predictive value (PPV). However, the models used to generate the synthetic signals are a simplification of the natural processes, so we retrain the CNN with a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models and selected real examples, achieving a final PPV of 82%. Although applying atmospheric corrections to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is relatively simple to apply them to the small subset of positive results. This further improves the detection performance without a significant increase in computational burden (PPV of 100%). Thus, we demonstrate that training with synthetic examples can improve the ability of CNNs to detect volcano deformation in satellite images, and propose an efficient workflow for the development of automated systems.  2019 Elsevier Inc.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:10","2022-08-10 17:41:10","","","","","230","","Remote Sensing of Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.04.032","Deep learning; Automation; Learning systems; Error detection; Large dataset; Convolutional neural networks; Monte Carlo methods; Image enhancement; Satellite imagery; Synthetic aperture radar; Deformation; Interferometry; Space-based radar; Volcanoes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We can reduce the errors by introducing a rejection mechanism, but this approach may reject too many products for manual re-checking.

Herein, we address these problems by learning the traffic signs through deep learning, which is robust against scale changes.

Coffee is an important commercial crop in India which is affected by pests and diseases every year resulting in major yield loss. White stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) is the most serious pest of coffee (Arabica sp.) in India causing substantial loss of yield every year. Detection of the infestation in its early stage is quite challenging. In this regard, image pattern recognition techniques offer cost effective and scalable solutions. An image library was created representing different stages of the plant infestation using camera/mobile devices. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models use these images of healthy and infested plants for early detection of white stem borer infestation. The overall methodology included image processing, machine learning, supervised transfer learning and unsupervised auto-encoding techniques to solve the problem of early detection and severity of the infestation. Using the Inception v3 transfer learning model, we obtained average accuracy of 85.5% which is quite encouraging with limited image datasets. We explore Unsupervised Autoencoder models, which can work with limited image datasets. In addition, statistical analysis of long-term climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and luminescence is explored for reliable detection and diagnosis of the infestation. Based on the encouraging results, a mobile application is proposed for near real time monitoring of WSB infestation to help the coffee planter's community.  Authors 2019.

For each pixel in the rectangle region we generate a block whose center is at the pixel, and the pixel is classified into either a lip or non-lip pixel by exploiting the pixels in the block. Deep neural networks are trained using a sufficient number of labeled blocks obtained from a quite tractable number of labeled images.

The images consist of the inside of the examined elements obtained from testing devices such as the ultrasonic tomograph. However, such an automatic inspection is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. To address some of these problems, this paper aims to evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) toward an automated detection of flaws in concrete elements using ultrasonic tomography. There are two main stages in the proposed methodology. In the first stage, an image of the inside of the examined structure is obtained and recorded by performing ultrasonic tomography-based testing. In the second stage, a convolutional neural network model is used for automatic detection of defects and flaws in the recorded image. In this work, a large and pre-trained CNN is used. It was fine-tuned on a small set of images collected during laboratory tests. Lastly, the prepared model was applied for detecting flaws. The obtained model has proven to be able to accurately detect defects in examined concrete elements. The presented approach for automatic detection of flaws is being developed with the potential to not only detect defects of one type but also to classify various types of defects in concrete elements.  2020 by the authors.","2020","2022-08-10 17:41:12","2022-08-10 17:41:12","","","","7","13","","Materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma13071557","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Defects; Convolution; Tomography; Concretes; Transfer learning; Nondestructive examination; Ultrasonic testing; Ultrasonics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its main work is to simulate the human visual system by establishing a visual-aware model. However, most of existing models have suffered from two challenges. First, edge-aware models only use edge feature to improve segmentation features but lack of utilizing the complementarity of them. Second, the problem of losing part of information in the process of extracting features in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) leads to the incompleteness of final result. In this paper, we proposed a criss-cross refined salient object detection method based on hybrid attention to solve these problems. Specifically, we applied a Criss-Cross Attention module (CCA) to capture useful contextual information of surrounding pixels from long-range dependencies effectively. Fully considering the complementary between salient detection and edge information, our model simultaneously refines multilevel features of SOD and edge detection by overlapping a Cross Refinement Unit (CRU). And finally we used a U-Net to output the refined result.

However, the detection background of HFSWR is completely complex, in which the ship targets usually polluted by all kinds of noises. In this paper, a novel ship target detection method based on optimized error self-adjustment extreme learning machine (OES-ELM) for RD images of HFSWR is presented. Through the application of two-stage cascade classification strategy, the proposed approach can impressively increase the detection efficiency in real time. Firstly, gray-scale feature and a linear classifier are adopted to obtain the target candidate areas. Then, Haar-like features and a optimized ELM are proposed to identify ship targets from precisely. In the proposed OES-ELM, the sparse solution of output weights is found by L1/2 regularizer process, in which the optimal hidden neurons can be obtained by pruning the ""weak"" nodes. In addition, both the output and hidden weights are updated to optimal value by pulling back the output error to the hidden layer. Experimental results show that the proposed OES-ELM has better generalization performance. Furthermore, the proposed method has favorable real time and target detection performance.

They are exclusively typical representations of the original input, and a plenty of methods utilizing them for anomaly detection have achieved good results. In this paper, we propose a new method combining these two features together to generate proper scores for anomaly detection. As both these two features contain useful information contributing to anomaly detection, good results can be expected by fusion of those two. The architecture proposed in this paper comprises of two networks, and we only use normal data for training. To compress and rebuild an input, a deep auto encoder (AE) is utilized where low dimensional latent variables and reconstruction error can be obtained, and compactness loss is introduced on latent variables to maintain a low intra-variance. Meanwhile, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network which takes the generated latent variables as input is established aiming at predicting its corresponding reconstruction error. By introducing MLP network, anomalies sharing similar reconstruction error yet different distribution of latent variables to normal data or vice versa can be separated. These two networks, AE and MLP are trained jointly in our model and the prediction error form MLP network is used as the final score for anomaly detection.

Extensive research has shown that pretty good performance can be obtained on public data sets by various state-of-the-art approaches, especially the deep learning methods. However, deep learning methods require extensive computing resources. In addition, these approaches mostly concentrate on single image detection and recognition task, which is not applicable in real-world applications. Different from previous research, we introduce a unified incremental computational framework for traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition task using the mono-camera mounted on a moving vehicle under non-stationary environments. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) to enhance detection performance by utilizing the contextual information, this paper innovatively utilizes the spatial distribution prior of the traffic signs; 2) to improve the tracking performance and localization accuracy under non-stationary environments, a new efficient incremental framework containing off-line detector, online detector, and motion model predictor together is designed for traffic sign detection and tracking simultaneously; and 3) to get a more stable classification output, a scale-based intra-frame fusion method is proposed. We evaluate our method on two public data sets and the performance has shown that the proposed system can obtain results comparable with the deep learning method with less computing resource in a near-real-time manner.  2000-2011 IEEE.","2017","2022-08-10 17:41:28","2022-08-10 17:41:28","","1918-1929","","7","18","","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2016.2614548","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Error detection; Intelligent systems; Surface discharges; Traffic signs; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Motion tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At this point, there is a wide number of areas where iris biometrics is successfully implemented as a means of access, areas such as finance, banking, healthcare, welfare, border control, point of sale and ATMs. The performance of an iris biometric system can be sensible to any error that may perpetuate, starting even from the eye image acquisition. It is obvious that an iris biometric system that functions with errors would eventually lead to behaving in an undesired manner: consistently rejecting its users and/or authorizing persons from outside the system. This article has the purpose of identifying the influence of one particular error: the Eccentricity Detection Error (E.D.E.), a newly identified type of iris segmentation error. Having a non-zero E.D.E. means having, for two iris images that are acquired from the same person, a different distance between the two vectors determined by the pupillary (inner) boundary centers and the limbic (outer) boundary centers. This distance is established on the basis of the approximated (during segmentation) inner and outer boundary centers for the two irides. This article presents the results of iris recognition using a PNN neural network, performed with iris codes at different values of E.D.E.: 0, lower than 2, and larger than 2.

Although recent object detector algorithms based on deep learning have achieved well performance for general object detection, they have limited success for specific applications. In this paper, a novel method based on Faster R-CNN for billboard detection is proposed. The proposed architecture is called attention-based multi-scale feature fusion region proposal network (AM-RPN). The contribution of this paper is to propose the attention-based multi-scale feature fusion method for billboard detection. Since the billboards and background features from the lower convolution layers are similar, it is difficult to improve detection accuracy using the multi-scale methods which contain the low-level features. The proposed attention-based multi-scale feature fusion method uses attention mechanism to give different focus to the information which constitutes the multi-scale fusion feature. Attention mechanism ensures that the important information is left and the useless information is discarded. Moreover, this paper proposes the adaptive non-maximum suppression (ANMS) algorithm to replace the classical non-maximum suppression algorithm. The adaptive non-maximum suppression algorithm considers the relationship between the classes and allows more low confidence targets to be detected without increasing error detection. Our proposed approach is evaluated on Baidu's public billboard detection data set. Experimental results show that AM-RPN and the class suppression obtains significant improvements over the comparable state-of-the-art detection models for billboard detection.","2018","2022-08-10 17:41:28","2022-08-10 17:41:28","","1541-5","","","","","","","2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC).

As cryo-balloon catheters are not equipped with electrodes, they cannot be localized automatically by electro-anatomical mapping systems. As a consequence, X-ray fluoroscopy has remained an important means for guidance during the procedure. Most recently, image guidance methods for fluoroscopy-based procedures have been proposed, but they provide only limited support for cryo-balloon catheters and require significant user interaction. To improve this situation, we propose a novel method for automatic cryo-balloon catheter detection in fluoroscopic images by detecting the cryo-balloon catheter's built-in X-ray marker. Our approach is based on a blob detection algorithm to find possible X-ray marker candidates. Several of these candidates are then excluded using prior knowledge. For the remaining candidates, several catheter specific features are introduced. They are processed using a machine learning approach to arrive at the final X-ray marker position. Our method was evaluated on 75 biplane fluoroscopy images from 40 patients, from two sites, acquired with a biplane angiography system. The method yielded a success rate of 99.0% in plane A and 90.6% in plane B, respectively. The detection achieved an accuracy of 1.00mm  0.82mm in plane A and 1.13mm  0.24mm in plane B. The localization in 3-D was associated with an average error of 0.36mm  0.86mm.  1982-2012 IEEE.","2016","2022-08-10 17:41:28","2022-08-10 17:41:28","","1892-1902","","8","35","","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2016.2537052","Support vector machines; Error detection; Electrophysiology; Image enhancement; X rays; Ablation; Balloons; Catheters; Fluorescent screens; X ray apparatus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An electronic nose (E-nose) and a visible near infrared spectrometer (VIS/NIR spectrometer) were applied for tea sampling. Feature extraction was conducted using both the traditional method and a convolutional neural network (CNN) technique. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were applied for pattern recognition. After sampling while using the traditional method, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed that the mean differential value of each sensor should be selected as the optimal feature extraction method for E-nose data, and raw data comparison results showed that 19 peak/valley values and two slope values were extracted. While the format of E-nose data was in accord with the input format for CNN, the VIS/NIR spectrometer data required matrixing to meet the format requirements. The LDA and PLSR analysis results showed that CNN has superior detection ability, being able to acquire more local features than the traditional method, but it has the risk of mixing in redundant information, which can act to reduce the detection ability. Multi-source information fusion (E-nose and VIS/NIR spectrometer fusion) can collect more features from different angles to improve the detection ability, but it also contains the risk of adding redundant information, which reduces the detection ability. For practical detection, the type of Puer tea should be recognizable using a VIS/NIR spectrometer and the traditional feature extraction method. The blended ratio of Puer tea should also be identifiable by using a VIS/NIR spectrometer with traditional feature extraction. Multi-source information fusion with traditional feature extraction should be used if the accuracy requirement is extremely high; otherwise, a VIS/NIR spectrometer with traditional feature extraction is preferred.  2019 by the authors.

Such a system (data pipeline), can be particularly useful in video surveillance applications, notably to support analysts in retrieving information from hours of video while working under strict time constraints. Such data pipelines entail all sort of uncertainties, however, which can lead to erroneous detections being presented to the analyst. In this paper we present a novel method to attribute a confidence of correct detection to the output of a computer vision data pipeline. The method relies on a datadriven approach. A machine learning-based classifier is built to separate correct from erroneous detections. It is trained on features extracted from the pipeline; The features relate to both raw data properties, such as image quality, and to video content properties, such as detection characteristics. The validation of the results is done using two full motion video datasets from airborne platforms; the first being of the same type (same context) as the training set, the second being of a different type (new context). We conclude that the result of this classifier could be used to build a confidence of correct detection, separating the True Positives from the False Positives. This confidence can furthermore be used to prioritize the detections in order of reliability.

This paper considers three feature families - statistical metrics, gradient-based metrics and wavelet transform coefficient derived indicators - as possible metrics to identify unsharp or blurry images. By using standard machine learning techniques, the suitability of these features for image quality assessment is confirmed, albeit on a rather small data set. With the increased availability and decreasing cost of digital ophthalmoscopy on one hand and the increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy worldwide on the other, creating tools that can determine whether an image is likely to be diagnostically suitable can play a significant role in accelerating and streamlining the teleophthalmology process.

In practice, these markers might be located outside the field-of-view (FOV) of C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems used in intraoperative surgeries, due to the limited detector sizes. As a consequence, reconstructed markers in CBCT volumes suffer from artifacts and have distorted shapes, which sets an obstacle fornavigation. Methods: In this work, we propose two fiducial marker detection methods: direct detection from distorted markers (direct method) and detection after marker recovery (recovery method). For direct detection from distorted markers in reconstructed volumes, an efficient automatic marker detection method using two neural networks and a conventional circle detection algorithm is proposed. For marker recovery, a task-specific data preparation strategy is proposed to recover markers from severely truncated data. Afterwards, a conventional marker detection algorithm is applied for position detection. The networks in both methods are trained based on simulated data. For the direct method, 6800 images and 10000 images are generated, respectively, to train the U-Net and ResNet50. For the recovery method, the training set includes 1360 images for FBPConvNet and Pix2pixGAN. The simulated data set with 166 markers and four cadaver cases with real fiducials are used forevaluation. Results: The two methods are evaluated on simulated data and real cadaver data. The direct method achieves 100% detection rates within 1mm detection error on simulated data with normal truncation and simulated data with heavier noise, but only detect 94.6% markers in extremely severe truncation case. The recovery method detects all the markers successfully in three test data sets and around 95% markers are detected within 0.5mm error. For real cadaver data, both methods achieve 100% marker detection rates with mean registration error below 0.2mm. Conclusions: Our experiments demonstrate that the direct method is capable of detecting distorted markers accurately and the recovery method with the task-specific data preparation strategy has high robustness and generalizability on various data sets. The task-specific data preparation is able to reconstruct structures of interest outside the FOV from severely truncated data better than conventional datapreparation.  2022 The Authors.

Recently, there have been strong correlations established between pre-biopsy multi-parametric MR image findings and the histopathology results. We investigate novel deep learning networks that provide tumor localization and classification solely based on prostate multi-parametric MR images using images with biopsy confirmed lesions. We propose to use a multi-channel image-to-image convolutional encoder-decoders where responses signify localized lesions and output channels represent different tumor classes. We take simple point locations in the labeled ground truth data and train networks to output Gaussian kernels around those points across multiple channels. This approach allows for both localization and classification within a single run. The input data consists of axial T2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, high b-value diffusion-weighted images, and K-trans parameter maps from 202 patients. The images were co-registered on a per patient basis and exhaustive comparisons were performed with 5-fold cross-validation across three different models with increasing complexity. The highest average classification area-under-the-curve (AUC) achieved was 83.4% using a medium complexity model, in which no skip-connection were used across layers. In individual k-folds, AUCs above 90% were achieved. The results demonstrate promise for directly determining tumor malignancy without performing an invasive biopsy procedure.

The calibration plate mainly consists of a white low-temperature aluminum plate with 77 round through-holes, a black high-temperature stainless steel plate, and a heating plate. It can be captured by the long-wavelength infrared camera and visible spectrum camera simultaneously. In order to reduce the influence of thermal crosstalk on the edge and angle sharpness of the thermal image of the chessboard calibration plate, we use the round through-holes to replace the black-white squares in the chessboard calibration plate. Based on the fabricated calibration plate, we also propose a related calibration method. The proposed method can quickly detect the calibration plate by using the YOLO-V4 neural network. The affine transformation is performed to get the front view of the calibration plate, and a novel circular detection strategy based on arc level instead of pixel-level is adopted to detect the edges of the round through-holes in the calibration plate. The centers of round through-holes are detected, and the parameters of the cameras are calculated according to the coordinates of the centers in the image coordinate system. The simulation experiments and error analysis have been done to verify the centers detection method. The simulation results show that the error of center detection is always less than 1.4 (pixel). In order to further verify the performance of the calibration plate and the proposed calibration method, a binocular vision system based on long-wavelength infrared camera and visible spectrum camera is fabricated, and the verification experiments have been done. In experiments, our calibration plate and the proposed method are compared with the famous Zhang's method. The calibration's average overall mean errors of the visible spectrum camera and long-wavelength infrared camera are about 0.0126 (pixel) and 0.0238 (pixel), and they are respectively decreased by 78.13% and 81.93% compared with Zhang's method.

This paper proposed an optimized method for identifying inundated area based on human perceptual visual attention and spatio-temporal variation characteristics of flood. Flood-inundated area is a temporary compound of water and other flooded objects (e.g., crops). It has specific spatio-temporal dynamic property, which differs from that of water body and could be used as a stable basis for remote sense identification of the inundated area. After the specific property was digitalized into numerical and visual data by generating a composite RGB color imagery of NDVI, MNDWI before the flood event and NDWI after the inundation, apparent coloring difference between water body and the inundated area in the imagery was reached. To gain reliable machine-vision detection based results of the flood-inundated area, an imagery of Munsell HLC color was transformed from the RGB imagery and then adopted in unsupervised classification based on coefficient of NBS color distance and K-means clustering algorithm. A case was studied on applying the proposed method to derive information of the inundated area in 2016 flood disaster in middle reaches of Yangtze River Basin and using Landsat OLI images. And an error confusion matrix method was adopted in the accuracy assessment on recognition results of the inundated area. The results showed that the proposed method gained excellent detection of the area with coefficients of Kappa and composite classification accuracy (CCA) equal to 93.4% and 88.5%, respectively. A controlled experiment on the credibility of different remote sensing classification methods for the same identification object (i.e. flooded-inundated area) was also made. It proved the proposed method for detection of flood-inundated area based on the selective visual attention mechanism could effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing identification on the area with its CCA coefficient of 5% larger than that of the traditional method. The proposed method also had good performance on easily separating the flooded-inundated areas from water and waterlogged cropland, especially helped solving the misclassification between the flooded-inundated area and the water body. These benefited from three keys: 1) The inundated area was viewed as that not equal to water coverage in remote sensing classification, which could be proven by the former's higher heterogeneity and its different spatio-temporal dynamic property. As a result, the identification uncertainty of the area was reduced. 2) Digital visualization of spatio-temporal variation features of the inundated area was completed through data fusion of NDWI after the inundation and NDVI and MNDWI before the flood event, which enhanced the area's visual saliency on the remote sensing image and made it possible to identify them using machine-vision color clustering. 3) Difference of the flooded-inundated areas from the water and waterlogged cropland was precisely captured in the NBS image in HLC space that was transformed from the fusion image at an optimized RGB color matching scheme (i.e. red given to NDWI after the inundation, green and blue to NDVI and MNDWI before the inundation, respectively). During summer flooding of the study area in 2016, the waterlogged farmland with crops uncovered by water was about 19 143.35 hm2 while the inundated acreage was up to 142 157.5 hm2, among which 16.6% (i.e. 23 579 hm2) was being planted with rice paddy. Additionally, most of the inundated areas located in low-lying land along mainstream of the middle Yangtze River and its two branches, namely Hanjiang River and Fuhe River. The most severe flood disaster occurred in Wuhan City with 34 492 hm2 of the inundated acreage.  2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Accountability requires understanding of system limit and condition of erroneous predictions, as customers are often interested in understanding the incorrect predictions, and model developers are absorbed in finding methods that can be used to get incremental improvements to an existing system. Therefore, we propose an accountable error characterization method, AEC, to understand when and where errors occur within the existing black-box models. AEC, as constructed with human-understandable linguistic features, allows the model developers to automatically identify the main sources of errors for a given classification system. It can also be used to sample for the set of most informative input points for a next round of training. We perform error detection for a sentiment analysis task using AEC as a case study. Our results on the sample sentiment task show that AEC is able to characterize erroneous predictions into human understandable categories and also achieves promising results on selecting erroneous samples when compared with the uncertainty-based sampling.","2021-05-10","2022-08-10 17:41:30","2022-08-10 17:41:30","","6 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","learning (artificial intelligence); pattern classification; text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides the logo and license plate, some other parts, such as vehicle face, lamp, windshield and rearview mirror, are also key parts which can reflect the characteristics of vehicle and be used to improve the accuracy of recognition task. In this paper, the detection of vehicle parts is studied, and the work is novel. We choose Faster R-CNN as the basic algorithm, and take the local area of an image where vehicle body locates as input, then can get multiple bounding boxes with their own scores. If the box with maximum score is chosen as final result directly, it is often not the best one, especially for small objects. This paper presents a method which corrects original score with relative position information between two parts. Then we choose the box with maximum comprehensive score as the final result.

First, we assume that a graph representation of an image is given with a predetermined connectivity rule and representative features for each of its nodes. Then, we learn to predict affinities related to this graph, that ensures a decent salient object detection performance, when used with a spectral graph based foreground detection method. To accomplish this task, we modify convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) for graph affinity calculation, which were originally proposed to predict similarities between images. Subsequently, we employ a spectral graph based salient object detection method  Extended Quantum Cuts (EQCut)  using these graph affinities.

Our novel confirmation approach is based on video images classification and specifically on identification of specific anatomical landmarks, including esophagus, upper trachea and main bifurcation of the trachea into the two primary bronchi (carina), as indicators of correct or incorrect tube insertion and positioning. Classification of the images is performed using a neural network classifier. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using a dataset of cow-intubation videos and a dataset of humanintubation videos. Each one of the video images was manually (visually) classified by a medical expert into one of three categories: upper tracheal intubation, correct (carina) intubation and esophageal intubation.

Image processing is primarily used, where fast and accurate Computed Tomography (CT) liver image segmentation is required for effective clinical studies and treatment plans. The purpose of this research is to develop an automated HCC detection and diagnosis system, able to work with HCC lesions from liver CT images, with maximum sensitivity and minimum specificity. Our proposed system carried out automated segmentation of HCC lesions from 3D liver CT images. First, based on chosen histogram thresholds, we create a mask to predict the segmentation area by exploiting prior knowledge of the location and shape. Next, we obtain a 3D HCC lesion using an appropriate combination of cancer area pixel density calculations, histogram analysis and morphological processing. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we carried out a series of experiments using 31 CT cases, comprised of 18 HCC lesions and 13 non HCC lesions. The acquired CT images (in DICOM format) had 128 channels of 512; 512 pixels, each with pixel space varying between 0.54 and 0.85. Simulation results showed 92.68% accuracy and a false positive incidence of 9.75%. These were also compared and validated against manual segmentation carried out by a radiologist and other widely used image segmentation methods. Fully automated HCC detection can be efficiently used to aid medical professionals in diagnosing HCC. A limitation of this research is that the performance was evaluated on a small dataset, which does not allow us to confirm robustness of this system. For future work, we will collect additional clinical and CT image data to ensure comprehensive evaluation and clinical validation. We also intend to apply this automated HCC detection and diagnosis system to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets, as well as adapting it for diagnosing different liver diseases using state-of-the-art feature extraction and selection, and machine learning classification techniques.

This growing reliance on real-time embedded systems, as well as the rise in the complexity of these systems, demands an efficient monitoring tool that takes the complex interactions in the system into consideration. These systems are well-specified, and there exists standard error or fault detection mechanism to detect when an anomaly occurs in the applications controlling the operation. Nonetheless, these anomaly detection mechanisms gather information about the behavior of the software against its intended goals through the use of plausibility checks which rely on a priori knowledge of the application behavior. This kind of test raises two issues: (1) there should be a complete characterization of the software to derive the redundant information needed for plausibility checks, (2) this test focuses mainly on detecting errors/faults/anomalies in a single application with no regard to other entities in the integrated system. On the other hand, an embedded real-time system (fitted with an operating system) usually has the operating system and the integrated application statically linked to produce a single executable image. This bespoke nature of the embedded real-time system design means that the kernel traces reflect the behavior of the application and the associated hardware components at every point in time. Consequently, detecting deviations in the kernel trace invariably imply system-wide anomaly detection in the associated application and hardware. Thus, this paper targets anomaly not just in the application layer, but also in other layers that make up the real-time embedded system. Therefore, we introduce a hierarchical attention-based anomaly detection (HAbAD) model based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks with Attention. It is a closed-world prediction-classification model which uses the reconstruction error from a non-parametric kernel density estimator to detect when an anomaly has occurred. We show the effectiveness of this approach using publicly available dataset, and the results confirm that this is a robust means of detecting anomalies in real-time embedded systems.  2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-08-10 17:41:32","2022-08-10 17:41:32","","225-231","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2018 IEEE 24th International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications, RTCSA 2018","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Hakodate, Japan","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2018.00035","Anomaly detection; Long short-term memory; Automation; Recurrent neural networks; Error detection; Predictive analytics; Software testing; Application programs; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Embedded systems; Fault detection; Complex networks; Hierarchical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is still a quite challenging task due to four reasons. First, the grayscale of the liver and its adjacent organ tissues is similar. Second, partial volume effect makes the liver contour blurred. Third, most clinical images have serious pathology such as liver tumor. Forth, each persons liver shape is discrepant. In this paper, we proposed DSL (detection and segmentation laboratory) method based on Faster R-CNN (faster regions with CNN features) and DeepLab. The DSL consists of two steps: to reduce the scope of subsequent liver segmentation, Faster R-CNN is employed to detect liver area. Next, the detection results are input to DeepLab for segmentation. This work is evaluated on two datasets: 3Dircadb and MICCAI-Sliver07.

Widespread usage of camera traps has led to large volumes of collected images, making manual processing of visual content hard to manage. In this work, we develop a framework for automatic detection and recognition of individuals in different patterned species like tigers, zebras and jaguars. Most existing systems primarily rely on manual input for localizing the animal, which does not scale well to large datasets. In order to automate the detection process while retaining robustness to blur, partial occlusion, illumination and pose variations, we use the recently proposed Faster-RCNN object detection framework to efficiently detect animals in images. We further extract features from AlexNet of the animals flank and train a logistic regression (or Linear SVM) classifier to recognize the individuals. We primarily test and evaluate our framework on a camera trap tiger image dataset that contains images that vary in overall image quality, animal pose, scale and lighting. We also evaluate our recognition system on zebra and jaguar images to show generalization to other patterned species. Our framework gives perfect detection results in camera trapped tiger images and a similar or better individual recognition performance when compared with state-of-the-art recognition techniques.  2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","2017","2022-08-10 17:41:33","2022-08-10 17:41:33","","27-38","","","10536 LNAI","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","Springer Verlag","Skopje, Macedonia","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_3","Learning systems; Quality control; Support vector machines; Error detection; Large dataset; Statistical tests; Data mining; Logistic regression; Convolutional neural networks; Object detection; Cost effectiveness; Computer vision; Animals; Cameras; Biometrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cutting the peduncle cleanly is one of the most difficult stages of the harvesting process, where the peduncle is the part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant. Accurate peduncle detection in 3D space is therefore a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated using qualitative and quantitative results (the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of the detection precision-recall curve). We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers.

This work proposes a pipeline of digital image processing (DIP) techniques, machine learning (ML), and temporal coherence to perform the detection and recognition of Brazilian traffic signs in videos aiming an application for real-time systems to help in traffic safety and to reduce the number of fatal accidents.

For detection, the red color segmentation and the Hough transform are used to find circular regions that will be classified through the SVM algorithm in sign and not sign. For recognition of these signs, the support vector machines (SVM) are used. For speed limit signs the thresholding and contours are used to segment the digits for later classification.

However, due to overload operation and poor working condition, the aerator will often has abnormal condition but cannot be detected in time, which will lead to rapid death of fish in large areas due to lack of oxygen, and then cause huge economic losses and ecological problems. The traditional methods cannot accurately detect abnormal condition of aerators in time. The manual inspection method is laborious and inefficient, and circuit detection methods often suffer from error detection or short circuit. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a real-time expert system for anomaly detection of aerators. Surveillance cameras are widely used as visual perception modules of the Internet of Things, but they are only used to detect suspicious behavior of human being in aquaculture in China. Using these widely existing surveillance cameras to realize real-time anomaly detection of aerators is a cost-free and easy-to-promote method, which also provides a useful reference and attempt for intelligent agriculture and agricultural expert systems. However, it is difficult to develop such an expert system due to some technical and applied challenges, e.g., illumination, occlusion, complex background, etc. To tackle these aforementioned challenges, we propose a real-time expert system based on computer vision technology and existing surveillance cameras for anomaly detection of aerators, which consists of two modules, i.e., object region detection and working state detection. First, it is difficult to detect the working state for some small object regions in whole images, and the time complexity of global feature comparison is also high, so we present an object region detection method based on the region proposal idea. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm called reference frame Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (RF-KLT) algorithm for motion feature extraction in fixed regions. Then, we present a dimension reduction method of time series for establishing a feature dataset with obvious boundaries between classes. Finally, we use machine learning algorithms to build the feature classifier. The experimental results show that the accuracy for detecting object region and working state of aerators is 100% and 99.9% respectively, and the detection speed is 77-333 frames per second (FPS) according to the different types of surveillance cameras. The proposed expert system can realize real-time, robust and cost-free anomaly detection of aerators in both the actual video dataset and the augmented video dataset. Copyright  2018, The Authors.

However, welding errors are usually encountered during the welding process due to external factors. The detection and correct classification of these welding faults are of great importance for the reliability of the weld and the material which was welded. Traditionally, welding error detection is usually handed by visual inspection. However, visual inspection is an error-prone and slow process. In this study, an image processing and machine learning based method is proposed to automatically detect welding defects. The welded materials are divided into sub-images and each sub-image is examined for defect detection and defect type classification.

However, the training of Faster R-CNN requires a mass of labeled samples which are difficult to obtain for marine organism. Therefore, three data augmentation methods are proposed dedicated to underwater-imaging. Specifically, the inverse process of underwater image restoration is used to simulate different marine turbulence environments. Perspective transformation is proposed to simulate different view of camera shooting. Illumination synthesis is used to simulate different marine illuminating environments. The performance of each data augmentation method, together with Faster R-CNN is evaluated by experiments on real world underwater dataset, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for marine organism detection and recognition.  2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","2017","2022-08-10 17:41:33","2022-08-10 17:41:33","","56-62","","","","","","","ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Singapore, Singapore","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3177404.3177433","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Object detection; Object recognition; Video signal processing; Image reconstruction; Inverse problems; Marine biology; Underwater imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These technologies offer new and exciting opportunities to increase the connectivity of devices in built environments, particularly for energy conservation. Most of the developed building energy conservation systems are based on sensors, thus, the application of those systems is limited to small spaces due to maintainability issues. The reliability of these sensor-based systems is still argued as sensors are not capable enough for multi-person tracking and real-time object detection. Giving emphasis to these limitations, the current study introduces a realtime object detection, tracking and counting system for building energy conservation particularly, for HVAC and lighting based on IP CCTV cameras. An experimental research design was employed for the study. Initially, CCTV images from three objects: human heads, lighted vehicles, and non-lighted vehicles were collected from 12 offices. Subsequently, these objects were trained using the machine learning and the real-time object detection was performed using a Single Shot Detector model. The proposed system was developed using the Python programming language. The developed system comprised of three basic features namely, object detection, object tracking and counting, and HVAC and lighting control. This system enables real-time object classification for human heads, lighted vehicles, and non-lighted vehicles, therefore, reduces excessive energy consumed by air conditioning and lighting depending on the nature and movements of the objects. With the use of this system, facility managers can make built environments much comfortable for occupants while deducting excessive energy consumption and human effort taken to manage comfort levels of buildings.

In this paper, the traditional method, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was used for detecting medicinal gelation hollow hard capsule as a control group; then hyperspectral image was used for detecting 347 normal capsule samples and 701 toxic capsule samples, which were analyzed and discussed from different image bands and regions of interest (ROIs). At the beginning, hyperspectral processing was used for dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, and then two kinds of capsules spectral data were obtained to do qualitative analysis according to ROIs. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis(PLS-DA) and Principal Component Analysis- Artificial Neural Network(PCA-ANN) were used to identify Chromium-laced capsule based on spectral data processing, of which 60% sample are used for modeling, the remaining 40% are used for predicting. In the end, we can draw a conclusion that if chosen 4 Latent Variables (LVs) as input features in the PLSDA model, high classification accuracy would be achieved, with the accuracy of 100%. The correlation coefficient of cross validation and sample prediction are 0.923 and 0.972 respectively; sensitivity and specificity are 100% as well.

Researchers in previous studies, detecting construction workers in the construction scene via computer vision techniques, have considered various features such as motion, shape, and color. Due to the pose changes of the workers, construction worker detection using body shape as a feature in the construction scene remains a challenging task. This study proposes a safety vest detection method, as a preceding method of the construction worker detection, which uses the motion of workers and the color pixels of safety vests for distinguishing from others in the construction scene independent of the workers' pose changes. The background subtraction method is performed by using an approximate median filter for the purpose of reducing the candidate regions that the color pixel classification will be performed as a sequential step. Then, the color pixel classification method is performed with a comparative analysis of two color spaces (Lab and HSV [hue, saturation, and value]) and three types of classifiers (a support vector machine [SVM], an artificial neural network [ANN], and a logistic regression [LR]) to classify the pixels of safety vests accurately. The proposed method has been tested on the actual construction site video streams.

Most recent works show that visual information can boost the NER performance since images can provide complementary contextual information for texts. However, the image-level features ignore the mapping relations between fine-grained visual objects and textual entities, which results in error detection in entities with different types. To better exploit visual and textual information in NER, we propose an adversarial gated bilinear attention neural network (AGBAN). The model jointly extracts entity-related features from both visual objects and texts, and leverages an adversarial training to map two different representations into a shared representation. As a result, domain information contained in an image can be transferred and applied for extracting named entities in the text associated with the image. Experimental results on Tweets dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed gated bilinear attention network in capturing the interactions of mutimodal features visual objects and textual words. Our results indicate that the adversarial training can effectively exploit commonalities across heterogeneous data sources, which leads to improved performance in NER when compared to models purely exploiting text data or combining the image-level visual features.  1999-2012 IEEE.","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:34","2022-08-10 19:22:24","","2520-2532","","","23","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2020.3013398","Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Image enhancement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the widespread use of English and an increasing number of English words, near-form words have also increased. However, the traditional way of identifying near-form words cannot keep up with this ever-growing language. A mathematical algorithm is therefore needed which can calculate the degree of similarity between words, so that near-form words can then be identified, collected and classified according to appearance similarity, and a specific value can be assigned to these levels of similarity. In related fields, there have been many studies of English synonyms, phonetic words, English sentences and texts. Some algorithms have been used with the aim of studying similarities in word appearance, but these were for hieroglyphics, such as Chinese words, and not for English words. Many similar words can be found in dictionaries or networks which are incomplete due to the outcomes of subjective collection. More importantly, subjective collection methods cannot determine the value of similarities, which highlights the uniqueness and innovation of this research. Among existing research methods, the one used most often involves fuzzy neural networks, which are unstable and inaccurate. A stable and unique mathematical calculation method is therefore needed. In this study, coding methods were used to design an algorithm that could calculate different letter position coefficients and letter appearance coefficients in order to obtain corresponding values. In terms of application, this algorithm can help generate big data on near-form words in English teaching. In terms of English input software, this algorithm can also provide more words to prompt the input method. In the case of text-editing software (such as Microsoft Word), the algorithm can improve error-detection accuracy and suggest suitable alternatives. In the field of artificial intelligence, it can also be used to monitor counterfeit trademark registration in the commodity registration system. Thus, the authors firmly believe that this application will have a wide range of applications in the future.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2022-08-10 17:41:35","2022-08-10 19:13:44","","","","","","","","","Journal of Supercomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-022-04511-6","Fuzzy neural networks; Codes (symbols); Crime; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking counting methods for example, almost all the recent state-of-the-art counting methods bypass explicit detection and adopt regression-based methods to directly count the objects of interest. Among regression-based methods, density map estimation, where the number of objects inside a subregion is the integral of the density map over that subregion, is especially promising because it preserves spatial information, which makes it useful for both counting and localization (detection and tracking). With the power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) the counting performance has improved steadily. The goal of this paper is to evaluate density maps generated by density estimation methods on a variety of crowd analysis tasks, including counting, detection, and tracking. Most existing CNN methods produce density maps with resolution that is smaller than the original images, due to the downsample strides in the convolution/pooling operations. To produce an original-resolution density map, we also evaluate a classical CNN that uses a sliding window regressor to predict the density for every pixel in the image. We also consider a fully convolutional adaptation, with skip connections from lower convolutional layers to compensate for loss in spatial information during upsampling. In our experiments, we found that the lower-resolution density maps sometimes have better counting performance. In contrast, the original-resolution density maps improved localization tasks, such as detection and tracking, compared with bilinear upsampling the lower-resolution density maps. Finally, we also propose several metrics for measuring the quality of a density map, and relate them to experiment results on counting and localization.  1991-2012 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:35","2022-08-10 17:41:35","","1408-1422","","5","29","","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2837153","Error detection; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Surface discharges; Object tracking; Signal sampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a 32-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) involving feature reuse by concatenating all features from previous layers. The proposed method can improve the flow of gradient, and the sharing of features and bottleneck layers can also dramatically reduce the number of parameters in the proposed CNN model. To further improve the detection accuracy and combine the directional features from the selection-channel-aware Gabor filtering residual (SCA-GFR) method with Gabor filtering and non-directional feature maps from the CNN model, an ensemble architecture called CNN-SCA-GFR is used, which combines the proposed CNN method with the conventional SCA-GFR method to detect J-UNIWARD and UERD. This can significantly reduce the detection error rate to below that of the existing JPEG steganalysis methods. For example, in the detection of J-UNIWARD at 0.1 bpnzAC, the detection error rate using our proposed method is 5.67% lower than that achieved by XuNet, and 7.89% lower than that achieved by the conventional SCA-GFR method. When detecting UERD at 0.1 bpnzAC, the detection error rate using our proposed method is 5.94% lower than that achieved by XuNet, and 10.28% lower than that achieved by the conventional SCA-GFR method.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:36","2022-08-10 17:41:36","","8481-8495","","7","78","","Multimedia Tools and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-018-6878-4","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Multilayer neural networks; Steganography; Gabor filters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), however, monitoring all the focal lesions visible on MRI sequences, even very small ones, is essential for disease staging, prognosis, and evaluating treatment efficacy. Small lesion segmentation presents significant challenges to popular deep learning models. This, coupled with their deterministic predictions, hinders their clinical adoption. Uncertainty estimates for these predictions would permit subsequent revision by clinicians. We present the first exploration of multiple uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) in the context of deep networks for lesion detection and segmentation in medical images. Specifically, we develop a 3D MS lesion segmentation CNN, augmented to provide four different voxel-based uncertainty measures based on MC dropout. We train the network on a proprietary, large-scale, multi-site, multi-scanner, clinical MS dataset, and compute lesion-wise uncertainties by accumulating evidence from voxel-wise uncertainties within detected lesions. We analyze the performance of voxel-based segmentation and lesion-level detection by choosing operating points based on the uncertainty. Uncertainty filtering improves both voxel and lesion-wise TPR and FDR on remaining, certain predictions compared to sigmoid-based TPR/FDR curves. Small lesions and lesion-boundaries are the most uncertain regions, which is consistent with human-rater variability.  2019 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2022-08-10 17:41:36","2022-08-10 17:41:36","","","","","59","","Medical Image Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2019.101557","Deep learning; Learning systems; Error detection; Forecasting; Diagnosis; Large dataset; Uncertainty analysis; Image segmentation; Medical image processing; Reactor cores","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparing to traditional X-ray imaging, it is more efficient and without harm to human body. Thus an automatic dangerous objects detection for millimeter wave images is useful to greatly save human labor. However, due to technology limitation, millimeter wave images are usually low resolution and with high noise, thus the dangerous objects hidden in human body are hard to be found. In addition, the detection speed is of great significance in practice. This paper proposes an efficient method for dangerous objects detection for millimeter wave images. It is based on a single unified CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Compared to traditional region-based method like RCNN, by setting some default anchors over different aspect ratios at the last feature map, it is able to frame object detection as a regression problem to these anchors while predicting class probabilities. The model gets 70.9 mAP at 50 frames per second in millimeter wave images dataset, obtaining better performance than other method, showing a promise in practical using in the future.  2018 SPIE.","2018","2022-08-10 17:41:36","2022-08-10 17:41:36","","International Association of Computer Science and Information Technology; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Multidimensional Information Processing","","","10806","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","SPIE","Shanghai, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502985","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Object detection; Anchors; Imaging techniques; Millimeter waves; Aspect ratio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is due to the lack of data on bad weather environments in the well-known training data, but there is little or no bad weather data that can actually be employed. In this paper, we propose a method to synthesize rain in road images as training data for road object detection in bad weather environments. The proposed method is composed of fog synthesis and rain streak generation. The fog synthesis step estimates and corrects the fog transmission value using depth information from a clear image, and expresses a fog-like feature of the real road image through Gaussian filtering and temporal filtering. We also generate rain streaks using the Unity3D program. We experimented with detecting road objects by learning synthesized rainy images and original rain-free images before synthesis, and compared the two results. Thus, we confirmed that learning with rain-synthesized images improves the detection rate by up to 53%. Experimental results also show that the proposed method can improve vehicle detection performance by about 3.5%, even with real, rainy videos.

Uncontrolled use of such UAVs in the context of public events like sports events or demonstrations, as well as their use near sensitive areas, such as airports or correctional facilities pose a potential security threat. Automatic early detection of UAVs is thus an important task which can be addressed through multiple modalities, such as visual imagery, radar, audio signals, or UAV control signals. In this work we present an image processing pipeline which is capable of tracking very small point targets in an overview camera, adjusting a tilting unit with a mounted zoom camera (PTZ system) to locations of interest and classifying the spotted object in this more detailed camera view. The overview camera is a high-resolution camera with a wide field of view. Its main purpose is to monitor a wide area and to allow an early detection of candidates, whose motion or appearance warrant a closer investigation. In a subsequent process these candidates are prioritized and successively examined by adapting the orientation of the tilting unit and the zoom level of the attached camera lens, to be able to observe the target in detail and provide appropriate data for the classification stage. The image of the PTZ camera is then used to classify the object into either UAV class or distractor class. For this task we apply the popular SSD detector. Several parameters of the detector have been adapted for the task of UAV detection and classification. We demonstrate the performance of the full pipeline on imagery collected by the system. The data contains actual UAVs as well as distractors, such as birds.  COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Although various methods have been designed to detect landmarks for computer-aided diagnosis, how to efficiently and effectively leverage deep learning approaches to detect sparsely distributed objects, such as mitosis and cerebral microbleeds, from large scale medical images hasn't been fully explored. In this chapter, we introduce a two-stage cascaded deep learning framework, referred as deep cascaded networks, to detect sparsely distributed objects that provide clinical significance with both high efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, the first screening stage with coarse retrieval model rapidly retrieves potential candidates, and subsequently the second discrimination stage with the fine discrimination model focuses on those candidates to further accurately single out the true targets from challenging mimics. Furthermore, we corroborate the importance of volumetric feature representations for volumetric imaging modalities by exploiting 3D convolutional neural networks.

Albeit recent progresses, the performance of KWD, measured in terms of precision and recall rate, may still degrade significantly when either the non-speech ambient noises or the human voice and speech-like interferences (e. g., TV, background competing talkers) exists. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address all kinds of environmental interferences. A novel text-dependent speech enhancement (TDSE) technique using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) is presented for improving the robustness of the small-footprint KWD task in the presence of environmental noises and interfering talkers. On our large simulated and recorded noisy and far-field evaluation sets, we show that TDSE significantly improves the quality of the target keyword speech and performs particularly well under speech interference conditions. We demonstrate that KWD with TDSE frontend significantly outperforms the baseline KWD system with or without a generic speech enhancement in terms of equal error rate (EER) in the keyword detection evaluation.  2018 International Speech Communication Association.

This problem has been addressed using docking systems by underwater recharging and data transfer for AUVs. In this paper, we propose a vision-based framework by addressing the detection and pose estimation problems for short-range underwater docking using these systems. For robust and credible detection of docking stations, we propose a convolutional neural network called docking neural network (DoNN). For accurate pose estimation, a perspective-n-point algorithm is integrated into our framework. In order to examine our framework in underwater docking tasks, we collected a dataset of 2D images, named underwater docking images dataset (UDID), which is the first publicly available underwater docking dataset to the best of our knowledge. In the field experiments, we first evaluate the performance of DoNN on the UDID and its deformed variations. Next, we examine the pose estimation module by ground and underwater experiments. At last, we integrate our proposed vision-based framework with an ultra-short baseline acoustic sensor, to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our framework by performing experiments in a lake.

As a result, some non-face regions are recognized as faces (false positive) and that influences the effectiveness of face detection algorithms which is characterized by low false positive (FP) rate, high detection rate and high speed of processing. In order to reduce these non-face regions, they are considered as anomalies and then try to detect them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method using reconstruction error from variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a generative machine learning model. We train VAE to learn reconstructing faces that are close to its original input faces using FDDB dataset, then the difference between the original input face and the reconstructed output is measured to obtain the reconstruction error which can be used as an anomaly score. Consequently, the regions resulting from faces detection algorithm with high reconstruction error are defined as anomalies or false positives.  2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:38","2022-08-10 17:41:38","","","","","618","","","","IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering","","","","IOP Publishing Ltd","Plovdiv, Bulgaria","","","","","","","","Issue: 1","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/618/1/012011","Anomaly detection; Learning systems; Error detection; Signal detection; Face recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Product quality inspection is an essential step in a production line. So far, this task has been conducted primarily by human inspectors, but the inspection results are often affected by various human factors such as experience, health conditions, attention, and so on. CNN can be useful for reducing human factors and thus can be good for quality control. In practice, however, CNN-based defect detection is still a challenging task. One reason is that a single false negative (FN) error (i.e., classifying a defect as a normal case) may be a liability for a company, and this is the crucial difference between image recognition and defect detection. To reduce the FN error rate, in this study, we investigate the effect of 'rejection' for defect detection. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN ensemble with a proper rejection rate can have a very low FN error rate and can reduce human labor significantly.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:39","2022-08-10 17:41:39","","326-331","","","","","","","Proceedings - IEEE 17th International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, IEEE 17th International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing, 4th Cyber Science and Technology Congress, DASC-PiCom-CBDCom-CyberSciTech 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Fukuoka, Japan","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech.2019.00067","Big data; Deep learning; Pattern recognition; Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Defects; Convolution; Inspection; Transfer learning; Human engineering; Image classification; Image recognition; Surface defects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide timely and accurate detection in twister disease of onion, remote sensing was exploited using Sentinel 2 imageries. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the VIS-NIR region of the image were evaluated for their capability to detect twister disease. VIs were subjected to regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices and severity index of onion twister disease. Vegetation indices with strong relationship to twister disease were selected and further used in unsupervised ISODATA classification. Overall accuracy of classification generated from vegetation indices were calculated based on confusion matrix using ground truth points collected from field work to identify the most suitable index based on highest overall accuracy. It was found out that NDVI and GNDVI has the highest coefficient of determination (R2) indicating a strong relationship to the disease severity. Results of the classification show that GNDVI, PSSRa and NDVI obtained the highest overall accuracy. This indicates that these 3 VIs can be used for detection of twister disease in the field since it gives better discrimination and high accuracies. Hence, VI's generated from Sentinel 2 imagery has the potential in detection, monitoring and management of twister disease of onion in the field.  2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

However, researchers have also demonstrated them to be highly sensitive to adversarial perturbation and hence, tend to be unreliable and lack robustness. While most of the research on adversarial perturbation focuses on image specific attacks, recently, image-agnostic Universal perturbations are proposed which learn the adversarial pattern over training distribution and have broader impact on real-world security applications. Such adversarial attacks can have compounding effect on face recognition where these visually imperceptible attacks can cause mismatches. To defend against adversarial attacks, sophisticated detection approaches are prevalent but most of the existing approaches do not focus on image-agnostic attacks. In this paper, we present a simple but efficient approach based on pixel values and Principal Component Analysis as features coupled with a Support Vector Machine as the classifier, to detect image-agnostic universal perturbations. We also present evaluation metrics, namely adversarial perturbation class classification error rate, original class classification error rate, and average classification error rate, to estimate the performance of adversarial perturbation detection algorithms. The experimental results on multiple databases and different DNN architectures show that it is indeed not required to build complex detection algorithms; rather simpler approaches can yield higher detection rates and lower error rates for image agnostic adversarial perturbation.  2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-08-10 17:41:39","2022-08-10 17:41:39","","","","","","","","","2018 IEEE 9th International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems, BTAS 2018","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Redondo Beach, CA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BTAS.2018.8698548","Support vector machines; Error detection; Deep neural networks; Object recognition; Signal detection; Face recognition; Biometrics; Complexation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds, instance segmentation often suffers unsatisfying performance in various scenes such as autonomous driving. There are two main difficulties. First, in a wild scene, background noise often occupies a majority of the entire point set. Second, small-scale objects are often difficult to be recognized due to larger uncertainty. In this paper, we propose Det2Seg, a two-stage approach which alleviates the above issues towards more accurate instance segmentation of road-objects. In the first stage, we adopt Pointpillars [1] to detect the regions-of-interest that can localize and classify objects in a coarse level; in the second stage, we extract points from the detected regions into pillars, encode them into a new data format and feed it into a 2D convolutional neural network to perform fine-grained, domain-specific instance segmentation. We evaluate our approach on raw LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data from the KITTI dataset [2]. The experimental results show that our approach largely outperforms the prior researches. In particular, our approach stands out for its significant ability on recognizing and segmenting small-scale objects, i.e., an improvement of over 20% in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU), beyond state-of-the-Arts, is obtained for the cyclist class.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:40","2022-08-10 17:41:40","","SPIE; University of Technology Sydney","","","","","","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing, VCIP 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Sydney, NSW, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VCIP47243.2019.8965792","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Roads and streets; Image segmentation; Optical radar; Visual communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present work proposes a cervical lesion detection net (CLDNet) model based on the deep convolutional neural network. The Squeeze-Excitation convolutional neural network (SE-CNN) is employed to extract depth features of the whole image. Moreover, the region proposal network (RPN) is used to generate a proposal box of the region of interest (ROI).

However, for the task of fish classification and/or fish detection, if a CNN was trained to detect or classify particular fish species in particular background habitats, the same CNN exhibits much lower accuracy when applied to new/unseen fish species and/or fish habitats. Therefore, in practice, the CNN needs to be continuously fine-tuned to improve its classification accuracy to handle new project-specific fish species or habitats. In this work we present a labelling-efficient method of training a CNN-based fish-detector (the Xception CNN was used as the base) on relatively small numbers (4,000) of project-domain underwater fish/no-fish images from 20 different habitats. Additionally, 17,000 of known negative (that is, missing fish) general-domain (VOC2012) above-water images were used. Two publicly available fish-domain datasets supplied additional 27,000 of above-water and underwater positive/fish images. By using this multi-domain collection of images, the trained Xception-based binary (fish/not-fish) classifier achieved 0.17% false-positives and 0.61% false-negatives on the project's 20,000 negative and 16,000 positive holdout test images, respectively.

Owing to a large number of CT images formed by the advanced spiral CT scanning technology, a pulmonary nodules detection model based on user-defined deep belief network with five layers (PndDBN-5) is proposed in this paper. The process of the method consists of three main stages: image pre-processing, training of PndDBN-5, testing of PndDBN-5. First, the segmentation of lung parenchyma is done. Segmented images are cut with minimum external rectangle and resized using the bilinear interpolation method. Then the model PndDBN-5 is built and trained with pre-processed training samples. Finally, testing PndDBN-5 with pre-processed testing samples is completed. The data used in this method are derived from The Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) which is the largest open lung nodule database in the world. The experimental results show that the correct rate of PndDBN-5 model for pulmonary nodule detection reached 97.5%, which is significantly higher than the traditional detection method.

This paper introduces a novel approach to detect and segment sports motions using a wearable sensor for supporting systematic observation. The main goal is, for convenient analysis, to automatically provide motion data, which are temporally classified according to the phase definition. For explicit segmentation, a motion model is defined as a sequence of sub-motions with boundary states. A sequence classifier based on deep neural networks is designed to detect sports motions from continuous sensor inputs. The evaluation on two types of motions (soccer kicking and two-handed ball throwing) verifies that the proposed method is successful for the accurate detection and segmentation of sports motions. By developing a sports motion analysis system using the motion model and the sequence classifier, we show that the proposed method is useful for observation of sports motions by automatically providing relevant motion data for analysis.  2018 by the authors.

They can provide very good results but be very computationally intensive. However, in cases where the objects to be localised lie approximately on a known plane, a much simpler algorithm can be applied. One such case is localising kiwifruit in modern orchards, as the plants are trained to grow in a planar structure known as a pergola. The proposed algorithm uses tight distance limits (based on orchard geometry) to reduce the search space for matching fruit to a small window. For the majority of kiwifruit, the search window is small enough to contain only one fruit in the adjacent image, giving only a single solution. In cases where there are tightly grouped fruit or false positive fruit detections adjacent to true positive fruit detections, there can be multiple potential matching solutions. To solve these, each potential solution is evaluated based on how closely it conforms to the mean object distance from camera and a solution is selected. On real world test data containing 121 image pairs, the algorithm has a 99.2 % true positive rate.

In our method, a DCNN that had been pre-trained with millions of non-medical images was adapted to identify polyps using virtual endoluminal images of the polyp candidates prompted by a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. For evaluation, 154 CTC cases with and without fecal tagging were divided randomly into a development set and an external validation set including 107 polyps 6 mm in size. A CADe system was trained to detect polyp candidates using the development set, and the virtual endoluminal images of the polyp candidates were labeled manually into true-positive and several false-positive (FP) categories for transfer learning of the DCNN. Next, the trained CADe system was used to detect polyp candidates from the external validation set, and the DCNN reviewed their images to determine the final detections. The detection sensitivity of the standalone CADe system was 93% at 6.4 FPs per patient on average, whereas the DCNN reduced the number of FPs to 2.0 per patient without reducing detection sensitivity. Most of the remaining FP detections were caused by untagged stool. In fecal-tagged CTC cases, the detection sensitivity was 94% at only 0.78 FPs per patient on average. These preliminary results indicate that DETALE can yield substantial improvement in the accuracy of automated polyp detection in CTC.  2016 SPIE.","2016","2022-08-10 17:41:42","2022-08-10 17:41:42","","Bruker; imXPAD; Modus Medical Devices Inc.; Poco Graphite; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","","","9785","","","","Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE","","","","SPIE","San Diego, CA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2217260","Deep learning; Computerized tomography; E-learning; Error detection; Deep neural networks; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Medical imaging; Convolution; Computer aided instruction; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current techniques fall into 3 main categories (reference). These categories are reputation based, structural analysis, and sandbox analysis. The methods applied to these techniques range from human static analysis, machine learning and automated indicator analysis. These techniques and methods have varying generalizability, but when considering the rate of new unique malware (av-test figure1), require large resources to keep pace. This studys method is quantitative. By converting raw byte strings into symmetric matrixes, a process that has similarities to image manipulation during classification, the framework for a classification problem is created (Soo Han, Kang and Im, 2011). This study attempts to convert this problem into an image classification problem outright to reveal underlying structures in the binary patterns themselves. The analysis of raw file binaries is an important development (reference). This capability will allow security appliances to make complex file assessments at near line speed on networks or minimal process cost on endpoints. Today this can only be done with static signatures, such as hashes (reference). This generalized detection mechanism has the potential to be system agnostic. The ability to do a raw bit-pattern analysis creates a generalized model of detection, which can identify patterns in files regardless of any apriori knowledge of threats.  2018 Curran Associates Inc.

Several works dealing with the automated detection of building damages have been published in the last decade. The increasingly widespread availability of inexpensive UAV platforms has also driven their recent adoption for rescue operations (i.e., search and rescue). Their deployment, however, remains largely limited to visual image inspection by skilled operators, limiting their applicability in time-constrained real conditions. This paper proposes a new solution to autonomously map building damages with a commercial UAV in near real-time. The solution integrates different components that allow the live streaming of the images on a laptop and their processing on the fly. Advanced photogrammetric techniques and deep learning algorithms are combined to deliver a true-orthophoto showing the position of building damages, which are already processed by the time the UAV returns to base. These algorithms have been customized to deliver fast results, fulfilling the near real-time requirements. The complete solution has been tested in different conditions, and received positive feedback by the FR involved in the EU funded project INACHUS. Two realistic pilot tests are described in the paper. The achieved results show the great potential of the presented approach, how close the proposed solution is to FR' expectations, and where more work is still needed.  2019 by the authors.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:43","2022-08-10 17:41:43","","","","3","11","","Remote Sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11030287","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Error detection; Costs; Buildings; Mapping; Damage detection; Aircraft detection; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Photogrammetry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fill this gap, this paper for the first time presents a simultaneous lung field detection and segmentation framework for pediatric CXR images. Our framework, called SDSLung Net, is a multi-tasking convolutional neural network architecture tailor-made for X-ray images with relatively weak appearance feature but abundant spatial rules and structural information. It is adapted from a Mask R-CNN framework [1] by incorporating a newly designed Organ Structure-Aware Encoding layer in the backbone network for more accurate spatial variation and structural representation, in parallel with a deeply supervised fully convolutional network based segmentation branch for precise lung field segmentation inside detected bounding box. Moreover, we also constructed a new and so far the largest pediatric CXR dataset with pixelwise lung field annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SDSLung is capable of achieving significantly superior performance over state-of-the-art LFS methods on our large-scale pediatric CXR dataset and also achieving extremely competitive results on adults CXR dataset.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:43","2022-08-10 17:41:43","","594-602","","","11769 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Shenzhen, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32226-7_66","Error detection; Diagnosis; Large dataset; Network architecture; Convolutional neural networks; Medical imaging; Convolution; Medical computing; Pediatrics; Image segmentation; Biological organs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the methods focus on single persons, which estimate the poses in the person-centric coordinates, i.e., the coordinates based on the center of the target person. Hence, these methods are inapplicable for multi-person 3D pose estimation, where the absolute coordinates (e.g., the camera coordinates) are required. Moreover, multi-person pose estimation is more challenging than single pose estimation, due to inter-person occlusion and close human interactions. Existing top-down multi-person methods rely on human detection (i.e., top-down approach), and thus suffer from the detection errors and cannot produce reliable pose estimation in multi-person scenes. Meanwhile, existing bottom-up methods that do not use human detection are not affected by detection errors, but since they process all persons in a scene at once, they are prone to errors, particularly for persons in small scales. To address all these challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to exploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3D poses. To address the common gaps between training and testing data, we do optimization during the test time, by refining the estimated 3D human poses using high-order temporal constraint, re-projection loss, and bone length regularizations. We also introduce a two-person pose discriminator that enforces natural two-person interactions. Finally, we apply a semi-supervised method to overcome the 3D ground-truth data scarcity. Our evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its individual components.

However, in the context of diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), monitoring all the focal lesions visible on MRI sequences, even very small ones, is essential for disease staging, prognosis, and evaluating treatment efficacy. Moreover, producing deterministic outputs hinders DL adoption into clinical routines. Uncertainty estimates for the predictions would permit subsequent revision by clinicians. We present the first exploration of multiple uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout [4] in the context of deep networks for lesion detection and segmentation in medical images. Specifically, we develop a 3D MS lesion segmentation CNN, augmented to provide four different voxel-based uncertainty measures based on MC dropout. We train the network on a proprietary, large-scale, multi-site, multi-scanner, clinical MS dataset, and compute lesion-wise uncertainties by accumulating evidence from voxel-wise uncertainties within detected lesions. We analyze the performance of voxel-based segmentation and lesion-level detection by choosing operating points based on the uncertainty. Empirical evidence suggests that uncertainty measures consistently allow us to choose superior operating points compared only using the networks sigmoid output as a probability.

This paper proposes a real-time detection framework for on-tree mango based on SSD (Single shot Multi Box Detector) network, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithms based on deep learning. The mango image dataset used in this paper was gathered from outdoor mango orchards. Firstly, the dataset was annotated and converted to a trainable dataset for SSD network. Secondly, the author designed new sampling strategies and image distortions at the image pre-processing stage to optimize data augmentation techniques. Moreover, the default box proposal methods of SSD network were improved by redesigning the shapes of default boxes on multiple feature maps according to our own dataset. Finally, to explore which classification network is most suitable for mango detection, an experiment was presented to compare the detection performance of SSD network with the VGG16 and ZFNet as base network respectively. Almond dataset was also used to verify our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrated that, with optimization of data augmentation techniques and default box proposals, our improved VGG16-based SSD network can achieve higher performance than Faster R-CNN in on-tree mango detection, with F1 score of 0.911 at 35 FPS for 400  400 input image, which is a real-time detection.

Better identification of these lesions is important for effective management and patient prognosis. Detection on low-contrast CT images, however, even for experienced physicians can be difficult and error-prone, because the lesions are often problematic to be separated from the normal surrounding structures. Existing lesion detection techniques have problems in identifying and differentiating low-contrast tumors, which is related to their use of low-level features rather than high level of semantics. Hence we propose an automated approach using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and multi-scale integration to detect adrenal lesion on low-contrast CT scans. The architecture of FCNs includes deep, coarse, semantic information and shallow, fine, appearance information in a hierarchical manner and it enables the encoding of image-wide location and semantics, which are desirable characteristics for adrenal lesion detection. We also propose a multi-scale integration with a superpixel based random walk (MI-SRW) approach to refine the lesion boundaries on different scales. The MI-SRW technique enables us to constrain the spatial and appearance consistency and then use complementary information provided on different scales to detect adrenal lesions of various sizes and characteristics. We used 38 adrenal lesions detected on low-contrast CT and compared our approach to existing 'state-of-the-art' methods and found that our approach had superior detection performance.  2017 IEEE.","2017","2022-08-10 17:41:44","2022-08-10 17:41:44","","895-898","","","0","","","","Proceedings - International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Melbourne, VIC, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950660","Computerized tomography; Error detection; Diagnosis; Semantics; Tumors; Convolutional neural networks; Medical imaging; Convolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, a complete graph is constructed by employing superpixels as nodes. A high edge weight is assigned into a pair of superpixels if they have high similarity. Next, a random walk prior on nodes is assumed to generate the probability distribution on edges. On the other hand, a complete directed graph is created that each edge weight represents the probability for transmitting random walker from current node to next node. By considering a threshold and eliminating edges with higher probability than the threshold, a random graph is created to model input image. The inbound degree vector of a random graph is computed to determine the most salient nodes (regions). Finally, a propagation technique is used to form saliency map.

Urban plantation has realistic demands for single tree management such as catkin pollution, maintenance of famous trees, landscape construction, and park management. At present, there are problems of missed detection and error detection in dense plantations and complex background plantations. This paper proposes a single tree detection method based on single shot multibox detector (SSD). Optimal SSD is obtained by adjusting feature layers, optimizing the aspect ratio of a preset box, reducing parameters and so on. The optimal SSD is applied to single tree detection and location in campuses, orchards, and economic plantations. The average accuracy based on SSD is 96.0, 92.9, and 97.6% in campus green trees, lychee plantations, and palm plantations, respectively. It is 11.3 and 37.5% higher than the latest template matching method and chan-vese (CV) model method, and is 43.1 and 54.2% higher than the traditional watershed method and local maximum method. Experimental results show that SSD has a strong potential and application advantage.

Though extensive work has been done in the field of 2D video processing, the domain of 360 video processing has not been explored much yet, as it poses difficulties such as (1) unavailability of the annotated dataset (2) severe geometric distortions at panoramic poles of the image and (3) high resolution of the media which requires high computation capable machinery. The State-of-the-art detection algorithm involves the use of CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) trained on a large dataset. Faster RCNN, SSD, YOLO, YOLO9000, YOLOv3 etc. are some of the detection algorithms that use CNN. Among these, though YOLOv3 might not be the most accurate, it is the fastest, and this trade-off between speed and accuracy is acceptable. We improvise upon this algorithm, to make it suitable for the 360 dataset. We propose YOLO360, a CNN network to detect objects in 360 videos and thus increase the tracking precision and accuracy.

In this work, a workflow is proposed to quantify laryngeal movements from laryngoscopic videos, to facilitate the diagnosis procedure. Methods: The proposed method analyses laryngoscopic videos, and delineates glottic opening, vocal folds, and supraglottic structures, using a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based algorithm. The segmentation is divided into two steps: A bounding box which indicates the region of interest (RoI) is found, followed by segmentation using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The segmentation results are statistically quantified along the temporal dimension and processed using singular spectrum analysis (SSA), to extract clear objective information that can be used by the clinicians in diagnosis. Results: The segmentation was validated on 400 images from 20 videos acquired using different endoscopic systems from different patients. The results indicated significant improvements over using FCN only in terms of both processing speed (16 FPS vs. 8 FPS) and segmentation result statistics. Five clinical cases on patients have also been provided to showcase the quantitative analysis results using the proposed method. Conclusion: The proposed method guarantees a robust and fast processing of laryngoscopic videos. Measurements of glottic angles and supraglottic index showed distinctive patterns in the provided clinical cases. Significance: The proposed automated and objective method extracts important temporal laryngeal movement information, which can be used to aid laryngeal closure diagnosis.  1964-2012 IEEE.","2019","2022-08-10 17:41:46","2022-08-10 17:41:46","","1127-1136","","4","66","","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2018.2867636","Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Plasma diagnostics; Signal to noise ratio; Image segmentation; Endoscopy; Spectrum analysis; Underwater acoustics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successfully attacking face detectors could be a serious malware vulnerability when deploying a smart surveillance system utilizing face detectors. In addition, for the privacy concern, it helps prevent faces being harvested and stored in the server. We show that existing adversarial perturbation methods are not effective to perform such an attack, especially when there are multiple faces in the inut image. This is because the adversarial perturbation specifically generated for one face may disrupt the adversarial perturbation for another face. In this paper, we call this problem the Instance Perturbation Interference (IPI) problem. This IPI problem is addressed by studying the relationship between the deep neural network receptive field and the adversarial perturbation. Besides the single-stage face detector, we find that the IPI problem also exists on the first stage of the Faster-RCNN, the commonly used two-stage object detector. As such, we propose the Localized Instance Perturbation (LIP) that confines the adversarial perturbation inside the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) of a target to perform the attack. Experimental results show the LIP method massively outperforms existing adversarial perturbation generation methods  often by a factor of 2 to 10.

However, accurate teleophthalmology requires high-quality ophthalmoscopic imagery. This paper considers three feature families  statistical metrics, gradient-based metrics and wavelet transform coefficient derived indicators  as possible metrics to identify unsharp or blurry images. By using standard machine learning techniques, the suitability of these features for image quality assessment is confirmed, albeit on a rather small data set. With the increased availability and decreasing cost of digital ophthalmoscopy on one hand and the increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy worldwide on the other, creating tools that can determine whether an image is likely to be diagnostically suitable can play a significant role in accelerating and streamlining the teleophthalmology process.

Therefore, it is the key to avoiding the false alarm of the monitoring system due to the anomaly of the data itself. Data cleansing consists of two parts: anomaly identification and anomaly repair. However, current research on data cleansing has mainly focused on anomaly identification and lacks efficient data repair methods. The key to data repair lies in sensor correlation models based on mapping relationships between sensors. To obtain a good inter-sensor relationship model, it is first necessary to exclude anomalous data from the training data set used for modeling. Therefore, a two-stage data cleansing framework for collaborative multi-sensor repair is proposed. First, based on the analysis of anomalous features of GPS data, a bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network model is adopted for data anomalies classification and localization. As a result, the data segment to be repaired is determined. Then, on the basis of all sensor data in the time range of the day before the target repair data segment, the data set for data repair is constructed by excluding the anomaly data segments in the data set with the help of the above anomaly identification results. Then, a conditional generation adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed to achieve data repair. Experimental validation shows that the two-stage data cleansing method of identification followed by repair can accurately identify and repair GPS anomalies. Finally, several factors affecting the repair effect are discussed. 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:03","2022-07-31 01:45:08","","","","","","","","","Structural Control and Health Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/stc.2993","Anomaly detection; Brain; Generative adversarial networks; Global positioning system; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Repair; anomaly detection; data repair; data cleansing; bidirectional long- and short-term memory neural network; conditional generation adversarial network; ONLINE; OUTLIER DETECTION; RECOVERY; REGRESSION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in domain adaptation. However, most of them leverage unlabeled target data only from a statistical perspective but neglect the analysis at the instance level. For better statistical alignment, existing approaches employ the entire unevaluated target data in an unsupervised manner, which may introduce noise and limit the discriminability of the neural networks. In this article, we propose confident learning-based domain adaptation (CLDA) to address the problem from a new perspective of data manipulation. To this end, a novel framework is presented to combine domain adaptation with confident learning (CL), where the former reduces the interdomain discrepancy and generates pseudo-labels for the target instances, from which the latter selects high-confidence target samples. Specifically, the confident learning part evaluates the confidence of each pseudo-labeled target sample based on the assigned labels and the predicted probabilities. Then, high-confidence target samples are selected as training data to increase the discriminative capacity of the neural networks. In addition, the domain adaptation part and the confident learning part are trained alternately to progressively increase the proportion of high-confidence labels in the target domain, thus further improving the accuracy of classification. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLDA method outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.

Its popularity has increased over the last few years due to the rising demand for machine learning systems usable by non-experts. Existing open-source systems fail to fully automate the machine learning tasks, being more like a black box that generates non-reusable pipelines. We propose an end-to-end system accessible to non-specialists and data scientists who wish to effortlessly create reusable and easy to understand pipelines for any regression and classification problems. The proposed solution increases the automation level by performing an advanced data cleaning followed by a complete feature engineering process without any domain knowledge about the data set. These processes are integrated into a search that generates for each model the optimum instance of preprocessed data. Bayesian optimization (BO) with a Gaussian process (GP) maximizes the performance of these models that will be ensembled using standard and probability-based stacking. We prove that the system performs better than 43.47% of practitioners on real-world data sets, being robust to any variation of tabular data. The true potential is revealed by surpassing at least one similar tool in 50% of performed benchmarks.

On the other hand, directly introducing additional data with low-quality annotations may confuse the network, leading to undesirable performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel mean-teacher-assisted confident learning framework to robustly exploit the noisy labeled data for the challenging hepatic vessel segmentation task.

However, in some application domains, it is difficult to apply machine learning methods to solve the new arising problems due to the lack of standardized and annotated datasets. People have to find their way from the very beginning of the data collecting, cleaning, and labeling. Unfortunately, there is not a guiding framework to deal with such a situation. This paper pays attention to it and proposes a general machine learning framework to solve the pratical problems from the scratch. It contains two main stages implemented by an unsupervised clustering method and a semi-supervised learning method representatively. In the first stage, an unsupervised clustering method is utilized to find representative data samples which are more important and can be used to do data cleaning and manual labeling. In the second stage, a semi-supervised method is adopted to predict the labels for the rest data samples and to construct a larger annotated dataset.

For a given dataset and a given analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal ML model quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start or which methods to use. Most current work focus either on proposing new data cleaning algorithms -often specific to certain types of data glitches considered in isolation and generally with no ""pipeline vision"" of the whole data preprocessing sequence- or on developing automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of the given ML model but that often rely on by-default preprocessing methods. We argue that more efforts should be devoted to proposing a principled data preparation approach to help and learn from the users for selecting the optimal sequence of data curation tasks and obtain the best quality performance of the final result. In this abstract, we present Learn2Clean1, a method based on Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that selects, for a given dataset, a given ML model, and a quality performance metric, the optimal sequence of tasks for preprocessing the data such that the quality metric is maximized.

Improved performance is possible by transductive inference, where the entire test set is available concurrently, and semi-supervised learning, where more unlabeled data is available. These problems are closely related because there is little or no adaptation of the representation in novel tasks. Focusing on these two settings, we introduce a new algorithm that leverages the manifold structure of the labeled and unlabeled data distribution to predict pseudo-labels, while balancing over classes and using the loss value distribution of a limited-capacity classifier to select the cleanest labels, iterately improving the quality of pseudo-labels.

In this letter, we aim to cleanse the dataset which contains noisy labels using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence algorithm and noise robust loss function. Here, we regard the whole dataset as noisy labels and separate noisy labels into two different parts. One is the strong noisy labels where there are the most noisy labels, which is referred to as incorrect labels, and the other is The weak noisy labels where pixels are incorrect in some parts of the image. The KL algorithm is more efficient in removing the labels which contain the most noise. At the same time, we use noise robust model to remove the labels where pixels are inaccurate only in small parts of the image. Noise robust loss function is robust to noisy labels, and thus, we consider noisy labels when intersection over union (IoU) is lower than a constant threshold despite using noise robust loss function.

Organizations of distinct types, sizes, and industry are adopting cloud services for a broad range of use cases, such as software development, product deployment, backup of data, email services, and numerous tasks. Although there are various advantages of using cloud computing as the ability to scale rapidly, store data remotely, reducing the overall cost. Cloud computing has some major trust concerns due to privacy issues such as lack of transparency, lack of user control over users data. Thus, lack of trust is a big issue for cloud service providers and cloud infrastructure users. This paper centers on how to achieve a trust management system around cloud services by finding fake feedbacks on CloudArmours Trust Feedback Dataset.

In this case, we divided data cleaning into supervised and unsupervised forms according to whether there were interventions in the repair processes and put forward a new dimension suitable for unsupervised cleaning in this paper. For weak logic errors in unsupervised data cleaning, we proposed an attribute correlation-based (ACB)-Framework under blocking, and designed three different data blocking methods to reduce the time complexity and test the impact of clustering accuracy on data cleaning. The experiments showed that the blocking methods could effectively reduce the repair time by maintaining the repair validity. Moreover, we concluded that the blocking methods with a too high clustering accuracy tended to put tuples with the same elements into a data block, which reduced the cleaning ability. In summary, the ACB-Framework with blocking can reduce the corresponding time cost and does not need the guidance of domain knowledge or interventions in repair, which can be applied in information systems requiring rapid responses, such as internet web pages, network servers, and sensor information acquisition.","2019-04","2022-06-10 02:09:06","2022-07-31 03:35:09","","575 (25 pp.)","","4","11","","Symmetry","","Symmetry (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym11040575","business data processing; data handling; database management systems; information systems; Internet; pattern clustering; unsupervised learning; machine learning; data quality; attribute correlation; data blocking; RULE-BASED METHOD; unsupervised data cleaning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, generating exhaustive and accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of refining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more accurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and corrected, and all of them require a - often very large - number of training samples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning (LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are processed jointly within a MIL framework, and a deep-attention mechanism is leveraged to discriminate mislabeled instances, mitigating their impact on the predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives, even while learning from a single slide. These results demonstrate that LC-MIL is a promising, lightweight tool to provide fine-grained annotations from coarsely annotated pathology sets.  2021, CC BY-NC-ND.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:06","2022-07-31 05:44:40","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2109.10778","Cleaning; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Diseases; Diagnosis; Large dataset; Semantics; Bioinformatics; Medical imaging; Pathology; Image segmentation; Clinical research; Refining; Image annotation; Semantic Segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study experimentally analyzes a deep learning-based gesture generation model from spoken text using a convolutional neural network. The proposed model takes a sequence of spoken words as the input and outputs a sequence of 2D joint coordinates representing the conversational gesture motion. We prepare a dataset consisting of gesture motions and spoken texts by adding text information to an existing dataset and train the models using specific speaker's data. The quality of the generated gestures is compared with those from an existing speech-to-gesture generation model through a user perceptual study. The subjective evaluation shows that the model performance is comparable or superior to those by the existing speech-to-gesture generation model. In addition, we investigate the importance of data cleansing and loss function selection in the text-to-gesture generation model. We further examine the model transferability between speakers.

Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data.

In B-DARTS, Broad Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) is employed as the scalable architecture for DARTS, a popular differentiable NAS approach. On one hand, BCNN is a broad scalable architecture whose topology achieves two advantages compared with the deep one, mainly including faster single-step training speed and higher memory efficiency (i.e. larger batch size for architecture search), which are all contributed to the search efficiency improvement of NAS. On the other hand, DARTS discovers the optimal architecture by gradient-based optimization algorithm, which benefits from two superiorities of BCNN simultaneously. Similar to vanilla DARTS, B-DARTS also suffers from the performance collapse issue, where those weight-free operations are prone to be selected by the search strategy. Therefore, we propose CLR, that considers the confidence of gradient for architecture weights update increasing with the training time of over-parameterized model, to mitigate the above issue. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that 1) B-DARTS delivers state-of-the-art efficiency of 0.09 GPU day using first order approximation on CIFAR-10; 2) the learned architecture by B-DARTS achieves competitive performance using state-of-the-art composite multiply-accumulate operations and parameters on ImageNet; and 3) the proposed CLR is effective for performance collapse issue alleviation of both B-DARTS and DARTS.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can suggest influential instances without using any domain knowledge. With the proposed method, users only need to inspect the instances suggested by the algorithm, implying that users do not need extensive knowledge for this procedure, which enables even non-experts to conduct data cleansing and improve the model. The existing methods require the loss function to be convex and an optimal model to be obtained, which is not always the case in modern machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach specifically designed for the models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method infers the influential instances by retracing the steps of the SGD while incorporating intermediate models computed in each step. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately infer the influential instances. Moreover, we used MNIST and CIFAR10 to show that the models can be effectively improved by removing the influential instances suggested by the proposed method. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

This paper presents a new method to solve the problem of image with label noise and background noise in weakly supervised learning, which can clean the wrong image with label noise and background noise. We first used the existing neural network VGG16_BN to extract the features of the image and delete the full connection layer.

The images screened in this part include images with 40%-60% label noise and background noise. It can effectively reduce the screening range of the wrong image. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in the dataset of cat and dog dichoromy in the public dataset. We screened and determined that the dataset contained about 0.8% error images, and designed 200 error images to be screened by the proposed method.

Removing noisy samples in dirty datasets is integral to and crucial in biomedical applications, such as the classification and prediction problems using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the body's physiological signal analysis. In this study, we developed a methodology to identify and remove noisy data from a dataset before addressing the classification problem of an artificial neural network (ANN) by proposing the use of the principal component analysis-sample reduction process (PCA-SRP) to improve its performance as a data-cleaning agent. We first discuss the theoretical background to this data-cleansing methodology in the classification problem of an artificial neural network (ANN). Then, we discuss how the PCA is used in data-cleansing techniques through a sample reduction process (SRP) using various publicly available biomedical datasets with different samples and feature sizes. Lastly, the cleaned datasets were tested through the following: PCA-SRP in ANN accuracy comparison testing, sensitivity vs. specificity testing, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve testing, and accuracy vs. additional random sample testing. The results show a significant improvement in the classification of ANNs using the developed methodology and suggested a recommended range of selectivity (Sc) factors for typical cleaning and ANN applications. Our approach successfully cleaned the noisy biomedical multidimensional datasets and yielded up to an 8% increase in accuracy with the aid of the Python language.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:07","2022-07-31 04:28:50","","8240 (24 pp.)","","17","11","","Applied Sciences","","Appl.

The data gathered through different sources, such as sensor networks, social media, business transactions, etc. is inherently uncertain due to noise, missing values, inconsistencies and other problems that impact the quality of big data analytics. One of the key challenges in this context is to detect and repair dirty data, i.e. data cleansing, and various techniques have been presented to solve this issue.

As such, a comprehensive and systematic study on the state-of-the-art mechanisms within the scope of the big data cleansing is done in this survey. Therefore, five categories to review these mechanisms are considered, which are machine learning-based, sample-based, expert-based, rule-based, and framework-based mechanisms. A number of articles are reviewed in each category. Furthermore, this paper denotes the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen data cleansing techniques and discusses the related parameters, comparing them in terms of scalability, efficiency, accuracy, and usability.

Apart from being a tool of general convenience, automated code repair has significant pedagogical applications for novice programmers who find compiler error messages cryptic and unhelpful. Existing approaches largely solve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative learning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box application of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of training time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types. We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive discriminative learning techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair. Experiments indicate that the fine-grained approach adopted by MACER offers not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student. MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types  whether popular or rare. MACER offers a training time speedup of 2 over TRACER and 800 over RLAssist, and a test time speedup of 2  4 over both. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Acquiring massive high-quality labeled data from experts is often infeasible. Unfortunately, without sufficient high-quality pixel-level labels, the usual data-driven learning-based segmentation methods often struggle with deficient training. As a result, we are often forced to collect additional labeled data from multiple sources with varying label qualities. However, directly introducing additional data with low-quality noisy labels may mislead the network training and undesirably offset the efficacy provided by those high-quality labels. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Teacher-assisted Confident Learning (MTCL) framework constructed by a teacher-student architecture and a label self-denoising process to robustly learn segmentation from a small set of high-quality labeled data and plentiful low-quality noisy labeled data. Particularly, such a synergistic framework is capable of simultaneously and robustly exploiting (i) the additional dark knowledge inside the images of low-quality labeled set via perturbation-based unsupervised consistency, and (ii) the productive information of their low-quality noisy labels via explicit label refinement. Comprehensive experiments on left atrium segmentation with simulated noisy labels and hepatic and retinal vessel segmentation with real-world noisy labels demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of our approach as well as its effectiveness on label denoising.

How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This paper presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs. Evaluated using eleven popular adversarial attacks and two representative out-of-distribution datasets, we show that XEnsemble achieves a high defense success rate against adversarial examples and a high detection success rate against out-of-distribution data inputs, and outperforms existing representative defense methods with respect to robustness and defensibility.

In order to facilitate the application of deep learning in radio signal recognition, in this work, a large-scale real-world radio signal dataset is created based on a special aeronautical monitoring system - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). This paper makes two main contributions. First, an automatic data collection and labeling system is designed to capture over-the-air ADS-B signals in the open and real-world scenario without human participation. Through data cleaning and sorting, a high-quality dataset of ADS-B signals is created for radio signal recognition. Second, we conduct an in-depth study on the performance of deep learning models using the new dataset, as well as comparison with a recognition benchmark using machine learning and deep learning methods.

Social media websites also have people with large number of opinions on a particular subject. Mining of opinions can be extensively used in the fields where opinions play a major role. This project caters to this need and classifies the opinions of people as positive and negative. This can further be used by movie recommendation systems and e commerce websites for evaluation of their product. It involved in the classification the opinions as positive opinions and negative opinions with the help of deep learning algorithms by achieving high accuracy. The procedures involved in this project will be of dataset selection, data preprocessing, data tokenization, and data cleansing and building a neural network. We have taken the dataset of reviews for this purpose. Data preprocessing and data cleansing is done so that deep learning algorithms can be easily applied on the data. Deep learning algorithms learn on their own and do not require guidance. The main objective of using deep learning model is for increasing efficiency, performance and accuracy. Here, we have applied three different neural network models to our dataset and compare the performances according to the testing and training accuracy obtained.

In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CORDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CORDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CORDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2% on public benchmark datasets.

Recently, many machine learning techniques have been used to evaluate air traffic complexity by constructing a mapping from complexity related factors to air traffic complexity labels. However, the low quality of complexity labels, which is named as label noise, has often been neglected and caused unsatisfactory performance in air traffic complexity evaluation. This paper aims at label noise in air traffic complexity samples, and proposes a confident learning and XGBoost-based approach to evaluate air traffic complexity under label noise. The confident learning process is applied to filter out noisy samples with various label probability distributions, and XGBoost is used to train a robust and high-performance air traffic complexity evaluation model on the different label noise filtered ratio datasets. Experiments are carried out on a real dataset from the Guangzhou airspace sector in China, and the results prove that the appropriate label noise removal strategy and XGBoost algorithm can effectively mitigate the label noise problem and achieve better performance in air traffic complexity evaluation.  2020, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

Since the sensors and associated transmission hardware are subjected to harsh environments, the monitoring data frequently contains various faults, and it is laborious to cleanse the data manually. For the purpose of automatically detecting and classifying faulty monitoring data in large quantities, this paper proposes a novel method that uses the relative frequency distribution histograms (RFDH) of monitoring data as well as the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN). The overall procedure of this method can be described as follows: First, RFDHs are constructed from different classes of hour-long data segments. Second, inverted envelopes of the RFDHs are labeled as the training data to train the 1-D CNN. Third, a well-trained 1-D CNN is used to detect and classify long-term monitoring data according to their RFDHs of hour-long data segments. Comprehensive validation of the proposed method is conducted with selective acceleration data collected from two long-span bridges. The validation yields satisfactory results, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and generality of the method.  2021 John Wiley  Sons, Ltd.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:08","2022-07-31 13:44:17","","e2824 (20 pp.)","","11","28","","Structural Control and Health Monitoring","","Struct.

Apart from being a tool of general convenience, automated code repair has significant pedagogical applications for novice programmers who find compiler error messages cryptic and unhelpful. Existing approaches largely solve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative learning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box application of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of training time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types. We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive discriminative learning techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair. Experiments indicate that the fine-grained approach adopted by MACER offers not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student. MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types -- whether popular or rare. MACER offers a training time speedup of 2x over TRACER and 800x over RLAssist, and a test time speedup of 2-4x over both.","2020-05-28","2022-06-10 02:09:09","2022-07-31 05:34:00","","19 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","learning (artificial intelligence); pattern classification; program compilers; program debugging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the proposed method, users only need to inspect the instances suggested by the algorithm, implying that users do not need extensive knowledge for this procedure, which enables even non-experts to conduct data cleansing and improve the model. The existing methods require the loss function to be convex and an optimal model to be obtained, which is not always the case in modern machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach specifically designed for the models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method infers the influential instances by retracing the steps of the SGD while incorporating intermediate models computed in each step. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately infer the influential instances.

One striking observation is that 8090% of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation and data cleaning techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training where using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications.

However, identifying those most at risk of developing neoplasms remains challenging. Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide a rich source of 'big' data on large numbers of patients. We hypothesised that in the period preceding a definitive diagnosis, there exists a series of ordered healthcare events captured within EHR data that characterise the onset and progression of neoplasms that can be exploited to predict future neoplasms occurrence. Using data from the EHR of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNG-HA), a large healthcare provider in Saudi Arabia, we aimed to discover health event patterns present in EHR data that predict the development of neoplasms in the year prior to diagnosis. After data cleaning, pre-processing, and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5,466 patients were available for model construction: 1,715 cases and 3,751 controls. Two predictive models were developed (using Decision tree (DT), and Random Forests (RF)). Age, gender, ethnicity, and ICD-10-chapter (broad disease classification) codes as predictor variables and the presence or absence of neoplasms as the output variable. The common factors associated with a diagnosis of neoplasms within one or more years after their occurrence across all the models were: (1) age at neoplasms/event diagnosis; (2) gender; and patient medical history of (3) diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving immune mechanisms, and (4) diseases of the genitourinary system. Model performance assessment showed that RF has higher Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.76 whereas the DT was less complex. This study is a demonstration that EHR data can be used to predict future neoplasm occurrence.  2022 The authors and IOS Press.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:09","2022-07-31 14:05:14","","37-40","","","289","","","","Studies in Health Technology and Informatics","","","","IOS Press BV","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/SHTI210853","Big data; Machine learning; Decision trees; Forecasting; Random forests; Blood; Computer aided diagnosis; Records management; Tumors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, recognizing human activities will help provide appropriate assistance to older adults, fighting the consequences of the population aging at the same time. For example, specific organizations, such as United Nations, reported an important risk of qualified human resources shortage to care for older adults in-home care. Hence, HAR solutions based on Ambient Intelligence (AmI) have been proposed to face these consequences. Therefore, we denoted an increasing interest in Ultra-WideBand (UWB) radars for HAR these last years. In this work, we exploited three UWB radars to recognize 15 human activities performed by 9 participants in a prototype apartment. The main contribution in this paper is data cleaning. Indeed, data provided by UWB radars have been cleaned with a band-pass Chebyshev type I filter of order 2. The application of that kind of filter is uncommon in the literature with the data of UWB radars. Also, this filter has been selected according to tests made with different filter types, and classification performances attest that data filtering is efficient. In addition, two different deep learning architectures to classify the cleaned data have been exploited. The first is a relatively simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the second is Efficient-CapsNet.

This is typically done today in industry by automatically clustering the strings then asking a user to verify and clean the clusters, until reaching 100% accuracy. This solution has significant limitations. It does not tell the users how to verify and clean the clusters. This part also often takes a lot of time, e.g., days. Further, there is no effective way for multiple users to collaboratively verify and clean. In this paper we address these challenges.

This research's main objective is to explore air quality from 2010 to 2018 in metropolitan zones of Guadalajara, Monterrey, and the Valley of Mexico. Air quality is analyzed based on the concentrations of criteria pollutants: Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In this paper, six stages are proposed:1) data collection; 2) data cleansing; 3) descriptive analysis. 4) design of cluster analysis models and main components; 5) application of machine learning models; 6) interpretation and analysis of results. This study has concluded that higher mean hourly concentrations for pollutants, CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and SO2 were found in Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone. In contrast, the highest mean hourly concentration of PM10 was found in the Monterrey Metropolitan Zone. Furthermore, the pollutant with the highest effect in the three critical zones was PM2.5, presenting high concentrations with hazardous air quality levels.

Advances in machine learning techniques have allowed researchers to make substantial gains in tackling complex problems in diverse fields such as medical diagnosis through image analysis, object detection and tracking, and natural language processing. However, often researchers only employ one or two machine learning algorithms with a static feature set while only testing a single hypothesis. This self-imposed bottleneck often produces suboptimal results because it arises from using machine learning within the classical, algorithmic context using existing development tools. Therefore, there is a need to create new development tools which reflect this change to the machine learning paradigm. In this research, we propose a development environment that allows researchers to leverage those capabilities more fully by shifting not only the tool they use but also their mindset. Our proposed environment serves as an intermediate tool, guiding the researcher and making full adoption of the machine learning paradigm throughout the software development process easier. To accomplish this, our framework is defined by a three-layer structure designed for subject domain assessment, data manipulation and feature set exploration. Supported by parallelism, data cleaning and feature engineering, this research provides a conceptual basis for future creation of development environments for the machine learning paradigm. Future development of such a conceptual design would allow for additional intelligent tools to aid the user in designing solutions and support reusability at the design level.  2022 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:10","2022-07-30 22:28:49","","329-331","","","2022-March","","","","Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Mobile, AL, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SoutheastCon48659.2022.9764094","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Software design; Diagnosis; Natural language processing systems; Medical imaging; Object detection; machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Software; Focusing; Natural language processing; Reusability; development environment; Parallel processing; software development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, co-occurrence bias in the training dataset may hamper a DNNmodel's generalizabil- ity to unseen scenarios in the real world. For example, in COCO [26], many object categories have a much higher cooccurrence with men compared to women, which can bias a DNN's prediction in favor of men. Recent works have focused on task-specific training strategies to handle bias in such scenarios, but fixing the available data is often ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel and more generic solution to address the contextual bias in the datasets by selecting a subset of the samples, which is fair in terms of the co-occurrence with various classes for a protected attribute. We introduce a data repair algorithm using the coefficient of variation( cv), which can curate fair and contextually balanced data for a protected class(es). This helps in training a fair model irrespective of the task, architecture or training methodology. Our proposed solution is simple, effective and can even be used in an active learning setting where the data labels are not present or being generated incrementally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of object detection and multi-label image classification across different datasets. Through a series of experiments, we validate that curating contextually fair data helps make model predictions fair by balancing the true positive rate for the protected class across groups without compromising on the model's overall performance.

To overcome the above problem, an efficient and accurate data anomaly detection method is desiderated. Traditional anomaly detection methods extract various abnormal features as the key indicators to identify data anomalies. Then set thresholds artificially for various features to identify specific anomalies, which is the artificial experience method. However, limited by the poor generalization ability among sensors, this method often leads to high labor costs. Another approach to anomaly detection is a data-driven approach based on machine learning methods. Among these, the bidirectional long-short memory neural network (BiLSTM), as an effective classification method, excels at finding complex relationships in multivariate time series data. However, training unprocessed original signals often leads to low computation efficiency and poor convergence, for lacking appropriate feature selection. Therefore, this article combines the advantages of the two methods by proposing a deep learning method with manual experience statistical features fed into it. Experimental comparative studies illustrate that the BiLSTM model with appropriate feature input has an accuracy rate of over 87-94%. Meanwhile, this paper provides basic principles of data cleaning and discusses the typical features of various anomalies. Furthermore, the optimization strategies of the feature space selection based on artificial experience are also highlighted.

Existing approaches are flawed, in that they only relabel incoming examples that look ""suspicious"" to the model. As a consequence, those mislabeled examples that elude (or don't undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data and the model with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose CINCER, a novel approach that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of mutually incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example, CINCER identifies a counter-example in the training set that-according to the model-is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks the annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible inconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so to serve as explanations of the model's suspicion, and highly influential, so to convey as much information as possible if relabeled. CINCER achieves this by leveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the counter-examples helps in acquiring substantially better data and models, especially when paired with our FIM approximation.

Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision  depth, breadth, and usability  to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.  2021, CC BY.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:11","2022-07-31 04:34:34","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Data handling; Machine learning; Data acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As users connect with these platforms, groups, organizations, and individuals can upload, co-create, discuss, engage in, and update self-curated or user-generated information. Although the platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., aid in the communication purposes, it also has some demerits like cyber-crime, hacking, etc. The growing number of crimes through these platforms needs to be deducted by predicting the crimes. For the crime prediction, the data acquired from Twitter is pre-processed for the data cleansing process. Later the features are extracted using various techniques like bag of words (BoW), Glove, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and feature hashing. The feature selection is done using a modified tree growth algorithm (MTGA) and clustering is performed using the fuzzy manta ray foraging (FMRF). Finally, the crime detection is done using hybrid wavelet convolutional neural network with world cup organization (WCNN-WCO).

"3KLPJYUJ","journalArticle","2021","Khalafi, Sahar; Ghadiri, Nasser; Moradi, Milad","Hybrid deep learning methods for phenotype prediction from clinical notes","","","23318422","","","MSC Codes 68T50, 68T07Background and objectives: Identifying patient cohorts from clinical notes in secondary electronic health records is a fundamental task in clinical information management. The patient cohort identification needs to identify the patient phenotypes. However, with the growing number of clinical notes, it becomes challenging to analyze the data manually. Therefore, automatic extraction of clinical concepts would be an essential task to identify the patient phenotypes correctly. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model for automatically extracting patient phenotypes using natural language processing and deep learning models to determine the patient phenotypes without dictionaries and human intervention. Methods: The proposed hybrid model is based on a neural bidirectional sequence model (BiLSTM or BiGRU) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identifying patient's phenotypes in discharge reports. Furthermore, to extract more features related to each phenotype, an extra CNN layer is run parallel to the hybrid proposed model. The extra CNN layer improves the model in identifying different phenotypes. We used pre-trained embeddings such as FastText and Word2vec separately as the input layers to evaluate other embedding's performance in identifying patient phenotypes. We also measured the effect of applying additional data cleaning steps on discharge reports to identify patient phenotypes by deep learning models. Results: We used discharge reports in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database in our experiments to identify patient phenotypes. Experimental results in internal comparison demonstrate that the proposed model achieved significant performance improvement over existing models. In addition, we pre-trained embeddings using FastText and Word2vce on discharge reports in MIMIC III. The enhanced version of our model with an extra CNN layer obtained a relatively higher F1-score than the original hybrid model. We also showed that BiGRU layer with FastText embedding had better performance than BiLSTM layer to identify patient phenotypes. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model extracts more features than existing methods of extracting patient phenotypes and provides a better F1-score. We show that complementing the proposed hybrid model with an extra CNN in identifying different phenotypes improves the F1 scores. In addition, eliminating punctuation, numbers, and stop words in discharge reports before training hybrid models resulted in increased model performance.  2021, CC BY-NC-ND.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:11","2022-07-31 13:29:57","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Recurrent neural networks; Patient treatment; Information management; Natural language processing systems; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has the ability to be one of the most dangerous things humans have ever experienced. It damages livestock, crops, and forests, among other things. To avoid this issue in mostly urban areas, the popular approach such as machine learning techniques may be used to predict air quality from contaminants. As a consequence, the quality of the air assessment and forecasting has become an important field of study. The goal is to develop machine learning-based air quality forecasting techniques that are as accurate as possible. The supervised machine learning technique (SMLT) will be used to gather several pieces of information from the dataset, including variable recognition, uni-variate analysis, bi-variate and multi-variate analysis, missing value treatment and analysis, data cleaning/preparation, and data representation. Our findings provide a valuable guide to sensitivity analysis of model parameters in terms of success in air quality pollution prediction through accuracy measurement. By comparing supervise classification machine learning algorithms and generating prediction results in the form of best accuracy, create a machine learning-based method for accurately predicting the Air Quality Index value. Furthermore, to compare and discuss various machine learning algorithms in order to determine the most accurate algorithm with the performance of a GUI-based user interface for air quality prediction. Motivation: The aim is to create a machine learning model for realtime air quality forecasting that can potentially replace updatable supervised machine learning classification models by predicting best accuracy by comparing supervised algorithms. The aim of this project is to use machine learning to investigate a dataset of air pollutants records for the Indian meteorological sector. It is more difficult to determine air quality. This research work attempts to reduce the risk factor associated with forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) of India to a safe human level in order to save a significant amount of meteorological time and resources, as well as to predict whether the air quality is bad or good.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:11","2022-07-31 04:00:06","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems, ICCES 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Coimbatre, India","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCES51350.2021.9488983","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Artificial intelligence; Recurrent neural networks; Quality control; Forecasting; Supervised learning; Turing machines; Agriculture; Air quality; Sensitivity analysis; Training; Predictive models; Air Quality Prediction; Atmospheric measurements; Atmospheric modeling; Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Classification Model; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Confident learning (CL) is an alternative approach which focuses instead on label quality by characterizing and identifying label errors in datasets, based on the principles of pruning noisy data, counting with probabilistic thresholds to estimate noise, and ranking examples to train with confidence. Whereas numerous studies have developed these principles independently, here, we combine them, building on the assumption of a class-conditional noise process to directly estimate the joint distribution between noisy (given) labels and uncorrupted (unknown) labels. This results in a generalized CL which is provably consistent and experimentally performant. We present sufficient conditions where CL exactly finds label errors, and show CL performance exceeding seven recent competitive approaches for learning with noisy labels on the CIFAR dataset. Uniquely, the CL framework is not coupled to a specific data modality or model (e.g., we use CL to find several label errors in the presumed error-free MNIST dataset and improve sentiment classification on text data in Amazon Reviews). We also employ CL on ImageNet to quantify ontological class overlap (e.g., estimating 645 missile images are mislabeled as their parent class projectile), and moderately increase model accuracy (e.g., for ResNet) by cleaning data prior to training. These results are replicable using the open-source cleanlab release. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

In this paper, we consider all the main noises and present a novel neural network-assisted error correction (ANNAEC) scheme to increase the reliability of multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory. To avoid using retention time as an input parameter of the neural network, we propose a relative log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to estimate the actual LLR. Then, we trans-form the bit detection into a clustering problem and propose to employ a neural network to learn the error characteristics of the NAND flash memory channel. Therefore, the trained neural network has optimized performances of bit error detection.

Acoustic logs are commonly used to derive rock mechanical properties; however, these data are not always available. Well logging data (wireline/logging while drilling - LWD), such as gamma ray, density, neutron porosity, and resistivity, are used as input parameters to develop the data-driven rock mechanical models. In addition to the logging data, real-time drilling data (i.e., weight-on-bit, rotation speed, torque, rate of penetration, flowrate, and standpipe pressure) are used to derive the model. In the data preprocessing stage, we labeled drilling and well logging data based on formation tops in the drilling plan and performed data cleansing to remove outliers. A set of field data from different wells across the same formation is used to build and train the predictive models. We computed feature importance to rank the data based on the relevance to predict acoustic logs and applied feature selection techniques to remove redundant features that may unnecessarily require a more complex model. An additional feature, mechanical specific energy, is also generated from drilling real-time data to improve the prediction accuracy. A number of scenarios showing a comparison of different predictive models were studied, and the results demonstrated that adding drilling data and/or feature engineering into the model could improve the accuracy of the models.  2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:36","2022-07-31 05:32:13","","","","","","","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition 2021, APOG 2021","","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers","Virtual, Online","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/205638-MS","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Acoustic logging; Gamma rays; Infill drilling; Neutron logging; Uncertainty analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Defect layer identification is a labor-intensive task that requires domain knowledge of experts to make consistent decisions over multiple datasets. Sometimes, it also requires examining multiple sources of inspection images to make the final identification. In this paper, we propose a multimodal machine learning model for defect layer identification as a classification problem from multiple sources of input images. After training two single modal models from each input source, we develop a final joint fusion model to achieve the best classification performance. This work also demonstrates how to estimate the final fusion model performance without exhaustively trying all possible combinations of single modal models. In order to integrate the approach into an industrial display manufacturing defect data analytic, we propose the data coverage model, which guarantees human-level classification performance within a certain portion of data. The data coverage model improves the robustness of the multimodal model, utilizing confident learning to make a high-confidence predictions for the particle defect layer identification and adding a filter to assess whether data samples are within the coverage based on the model's latent space density estimation. This work uses particle defects data samples in 8 different layers as a combination of TEM and STEM images from display manufacturing fabrication lines. Our experimental results show that the classification accuracy improves substantially by deploying the proposed multimodal model. The results also show that it is possible to implement the data coverage model to achieve the human expert level of defect layer classification for a portion of data to automate the task.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 03:18:07","","","","","2021-May","","","","ASMC (Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference) Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Milpitas, CA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASMC51741.2021.9435664","Machine learning; Process control; Semiconductor device manufacture; Defects; Analytical models; Training; Predictive models; Image processing; Data coverage model; Display defect layer classification; Fabrication; Multimodal machine learning; Semiconductor device modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though it's a useful technique for early cancer detection but sometimes its low predictive value resulted unnecessary biopsy of near about 70% benign case. There are also several Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems already have been developed to reduce this unnecessary breast biopsies. Hence, with this background, this project is directed towards developing a machine learning predictive model based on the 'mammographic mass' dataset which contain BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes and the ground truth for severity together with the ground truth (the severity field) for 516 benign and 445 malignant masses. Machine learning approach like data cleaning, data transformation, feature engineering and finally several prediction models based on their accuracy are applied. Among all of the prediction models, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) represent highest accuracy of near about 84.50% with reduced attributes after removing missing values and outliers.

Traditional data sorting cannot meet the growing demand of MCF research because of the low-efficiency, time-delay, and lack of objective criteria. In this paper, a Time-Domain Global Similarity (TDGS) method based on machine learning technologies is proposed for the automatic data cleaning of MCF devices. The aim of traditional data sorting is to classify original diagnostic data sequences. The lengths and evolution properties of the data sequences vary shot by shot. Hence the classification criteria are affected by many discharge parameters and are different in various discharges. The focus of the TDGS method is turned to the physical similarity between data sequences from different channels, which are more independent of discharge parameters. The complexity arisen from real discharge parameters during data cleaning is avoided in the TDGS method by transforming the general data sorting problem into a binary classification problem about the physical similarity between data sequences. As a demonstration of its application to multi-channel measurement systems, the TDGS method is applied to the EAST POlarimeterINTerferometer (POINT) system. The optimal performance of the method evaluated by 24-fold cross-validation has reached 0.9871  0.0385.  2018","2019","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 03:14:52","","159-166","","","234","","Computer Physics Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.07.014","Cleaning; Machine learning; Classification (of information); Sorting; Metadata; Fusion reactors; Magnetism; Reliability analysis; Time domain analysis; Automatic data cleaning; Machine learning technique; Magnetic confinement fusion device; MUlti-channel measurement system; Time-domain global similarity; NEURAL-NETWORKS; INTERFEROMETER SYSTEM; LARGE HELICAL DEVICE; POLARIMETER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many detection methods to detect malicious mining behavior have been proposed by scholars, but most of which have pure defects and need to collect sensitive data (such as memory and register data) from the detected host. In order to solve these problems, a malicious mining detection system based on network timing signals is proposed. When capturing network traffic, the system does not need to know the contents of data packets but only collects network flow timing signals, which greatly protects the privacy of users. Besides, we use the campus network to carry out experiments, collect a large amount of network traffic data generated by mining behavior, and carry out feature extraction and data cleaning. We also collect traffic data of normal network behavior and combine them after labeling. Then, we use four machine learning algorithms for classification. The final results show that our detection system can effectively distinguish the normal network traffic and the network traffic generated by mining behavior.  2021 Mu Bie and Haoyu Ma.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 05:23:42","","","","","2021","","Mathematical Problems in Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Hindawi Limited","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/2983605","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; E-learning; Data acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a short-term wind power prediction method based on data cleaning and feature reconfiguration is proposed. A large number of historical samples consisting of wind direction, wind speed, and wind power are mapped into a multidimensional sample space, and the distribution of wind data in different dimensions are analyzed in depth. By calculating the local density of each sample, outliers are effectively detected. The features of wind are reconfigured into a global information map combined with the time series information, which reflects the variation of the wind process in the short term. The features of the original data are greatly enriched, providing a high-quality training set for the prediction model. A redesigned convolutional neural network was used to predict short-term wind power, and the proposed methods were trained and tested based on a dataset of a real wind farm in China. Data cleaning and feature reconfiguration reduce the average single-point error by 1.38% and 2.56%, respectively, while the combined method reduced it by 6.24%. Plenty of experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve good performance and effectively improve the accuracy of short-term wind power prediction.  2021","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 04:20:22","","","","","292","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116851","Cleaning; Neural networks; Wind; Wind power; Convolution; Economics; Weather forecasting; Data cleaning; Convolutional neural network; Feature reconfiguration; Local density; Short-term wind power prediction; ALGORITHM; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DECOMPOSITION; ELECTRICITY; SIMULATION; SPEED PREDICTION; TURBINES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a method based on graph autoencoder-generative adversarial network to repair the missing data in the road network. First, the spatiotemporal features of the missing road network data are extracted through the denoising graph variational autoencoder which captures the original road network information to the greatest extent. Then, based on the spatial-temporal features, the study uses the generative adversarial network to generate repaired road network data, adds reconstruction Loss, and optimizes the objective function of the generation of the confrontation network. The effective interpolation of missing data is then realized. This study uses the Seattle (Seattle) and California (PEMS04) road network speed datasets to conduct comparative experiments on data restoration with different missing types and missing rates. When the random missing rate is between 10% and 70%, the mean absolute error(MAE) index of the Seattle dataset is between 2.38 and 3.25. The MAE index of the PEMS04 data set is between 1.46 and 2.38. When the aggregated missing rate is between 10% and 70%, the MAE index of the Seattle data set is between 2.51 and 2.82. The MAE index of the PEMS04 data set is between 1.52 and 1.54. The comparison results show that the proposed road network data restoration methods perform better than the backpropagation network(BP), denoising stacked auto-encoder(DSAE), bayesian gaussian Candecomp/Parafac(BGCP) and other models involved in the comparison analysis.

Most of the current security monitoring for IP blacklisting heavily relies on the domain expertise from experienced specialists. Although there are efforts to apply machine-learning (ML) techniques to this problem, we are yet to see the mature solution. To mitigate these challenges and to gain better understanding of the problem, we have designed the BlackEye framework in which we can apply various ML techniques and produce models for accurate blacklisting.

Hence, there is a need for more effective and efficient data cleaning solutions, which, not surprisingly, is rife with theoretical and engineering problems. This report addresses the problem of performing holistic data cleaning incrementally, given a fixed rule set and an evolving categorical relational dataset acquired in sequential batches. To the best of our knowledge, our contributions compose the first incremental framework that cleans data (i) independently of user interventions, (ii) without requiring knowledge about the incoming dataset, such as the number of classes per attribute, and (iii) holistically, enabling multiple error types to be repaired simultaneously, and thus avoiding conflicting repairs. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the competitors with respect to repair quality, execution time, and memory consumption. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

An example of such data is metadata for scientific datasets, which should be confirmed by data managers while handling the data. To support the efficient cleaning of data by data managers, we propose a data cleaning architecture in which data managers interactively browse and correct portions of data through views.

In this paper, in line with the low-rank sparse matrix decomposition model, a fast anomaly cleaning algorithm based on a deep neural network is proposed to solve the Spatio-temporal data cleaning problem in IoT. Both the Spatio-temporal correlation of sensing data and the abnormal values' sparsity are considered in an optimization problem. The Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) is used to solve it. Then the ISTA is unfolded into a fixed-length deep neural network.

To better protect and treat higher risk individuals and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems, it is crucial to identify risk factors and build accurate predictive models for COVID-19 related health outcomes. However, current predictive models focus on predicting the risk of mortality, and rely on COVID-19 specific medical data such as CT scans and COVID-19 lab tests results after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. To address these issues, we developed an innovative supervised machine learning framework using synthetic veteran Electronic Health Records (EHR) which were routinely collected during past clinic visits. Our models accurately predicted COVID-19 related health outcomes including mortality, ventilation, days in hospital or ICU. In particular, we developed a series of unique and effective data processing algorithms, including data cleaning, vector representation, initial feature screening. Then we trained models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies combined with different parameter settings. Our machine learning pipeline not only consistently outperformed those developed by other research groups using the same set of EHR, but also achieved similar accuracy as those trained on medical data that were only available after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, top risk factors for COVID-19 were identified, which include age, diabetes, metabolic syndromes, heart disease, kidney disease etc., and are consistent with epidemiology findings. Built on veteran's EHR, our results were especially relevant to veterans and filled in the gap of missing COVID-19 research for veterans who are at much higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness than the general population. This project also demonstrated that longitudinal EHR data can be successfully leveraged to provide a holistic prediction of an individual's health risk based on past health records, which is critical for controlling emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:38","2022-07-31 01:54:21","","519-526","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2021 IEEE 9th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, ISCHI 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Victoria, BC, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00099","Data handling; Machine learning; Pipelines; Computerized tomography; E-learning; Forecasting; Diseases; Diagnosis; Records management; Supervised learning; Heart; Health risks; machine learning; Predictive models; COVID-19; Medical services; COVID-19 predictive model; electronic health record; Infectious diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper establishes a data cleaning framework that is based on data mining and deep learning to eliminate abnormal data points and interpolate missing points to improve the accuracy of the original road inspection dataset. The first process in the proposed framework is to analyse the influential factors that are used to evaluate data quality and calculate the abnormality of the data through the confidence interval used in Gaussian fitting. Then, a deep artificial neural network is established to learn the mapping between the inspection data and data abnormality. The abnormal points are removed according to their abnormality level. Next, a second deep artificial neural network predicts the missing point values. Finally, by defining the overall cleanliness index of the dataset as the optimisation target, the steps are repeated until the cleanliness threshold is met. In this study, the proposed framework was applied to rut depth data cleaning for a highway maintenance project in Jiangsu Province, China.

The proposed approach is based on a collection of micro-agents. Each micro-agent is trained to detect a specific type of error using an atomic neural network based on a sample multilayer perceptron. The supervised learning process is based on a binary classifier where the training data inputs are represented by data types and data values. The Micro-Agent for Error Detection (MAED) is deployed at several instances depending on the number of error types to be handled. The orchestration mechanism of data streams to be examined is performed by a special Host Micro Agent (HMA). This later receives in real time a data stream, splits the current record into several elementary fields. Each field value is streamed to an instance of MAED Agent which responds with a signal of presence or not of a specific data type error of the corresponding data field. For each detected data type error, the HMA Agent selects and performs the appropriate cleaning algorithm from a repository to correct the present errors of the data stream.

This has a significant impact on a broad range of applications that are characterized by massive working sets and real-time constraints. However, it is challenging and burdensome for human operators to hand-tune various control-knobs in a cloud-scale storage cluster for maintaining optimal performance under diverse workload conditions. Our study on an open-source object-based storage system, Ceph, shows that common load balancing strategies are ineffective unless they are adapted according to workload characteristics. Furthermore, positive effects of an applied strategy may not be immediately visible. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning based system adaptation technique that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks. In particular, we applied a stochastic policy gradient based reinforcement learning technique to track performance hotspots in the storage cluster, and take appropriate corrective actions to maximize future performance under a variety of complex scenarios. For this purpose, we leveraged system-level performance monitoring and commonly available control-knobs in object-based cloud storage systems. We implemented the developed techniques to build an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) system for object based storage cluster, and evaluated its performance on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed. Experiments using Cloud Object Storage Benchmark (COSBench) show that, ARM improves the average read and write response time of Ceph storage cluster by upto 50% and 33% respectively, compared to the default case. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic load rebalancing technique in terms of read and write performance of Ceph storage by 43% and 36% respectively.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-31 03:53:28","","34-44","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Prague, Czech republic","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IC2E.2019.000-9","Open systems; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Cloud computing; Stochastic systems; Digital storage; Information management; Balancing; Dynamic loads; Knobs; Storage as a service (STaaS); Storage management; Task analysis; Hardware; Servers; Interference; Ceph; Cloud Storage; Load management; Performance Interference; Reinforcement Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because there are many abnormal users in these data, they are real but false data for personal credit evaluation. In order to better carry out personal credit scoring, we propose three criteria, power exponents of time interval distribution of individual user i, user activity Ai, and the ratio of out-degree and in-degree Ri of user i, which are used to systematically clean the data. And then, we used the logistic regression method to score the individual credits of users before and after data cleaning, and found that the rank order of personal credit scoring has changed significantly. This change is largely attributed to the changes of network structure after data cleaning.

Firstly, we use transfer learning to train and get a better image classifier, which makes the single image's recognition effect more accurate.

The main reason lies in the significant number of ageing infrastructures requiring a strategy to evaluate their structural integrity and durability as well as to enable structural prognosis. In the context of unsupervised learning processes, damage detection can be accomplished by tracking deviations of dynamic parameters from their normal conditions using specific tools, named control charts. However, the main drawback of dealing with changes in modal properties is represented by their high sensitivity to environmental and operational factors. It follows that these effects must be necessarily removed to obtain suitable damage sensitive features. In this regard, the selection of a particular statistical model for data cleansing inevitably influences the distribution of the residuals, the control chart and therefore the damage detection. To overcome this issue, in the present paper an original methodology is developed, based on Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which provides a new decision-support tool for the definition of the best environmental effects' removal technique. Residuals stemming from the application of different data cleansing methods, plotted in control charts are conceivably distinguished in False Positives, True Positives, False Negatives and True Negatives. Consequently, ROC curves are computed and compared, each one referred to a particular data cleansing procedure, among which Principal Component Analysis, Multiple Linear Regression and more and to a specific damage class. The proposed approach is applied in the illustrative case study of the Z24 Bridge, located in the canton Bern near Solothurn, Switzerland. The results of the application of the procedure demonstrated that ROC curves are a suitable tool for defining the optimal damage threshold and the most effective environmental effects' removal technique, in order to minimize the occurrence of false alarms.  2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-31 04:30:10","","","","","2021-June","","","","COMPDYN Proceedings","","","","National Technical University of Athens","Athens, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","Errors; Structural health monitoring; Principal component analysis; Linear regression; Alarm systems; Decision support systems; Damage detection; Control charts; Environmental engineering; Flowcharting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Security information and event management systems (SIEMs) perform some rudimentary automation but cannot replicate the decision-making process of a skilled analyst. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can detect patterns in data with appropriate training. In practice, the majority of the alert data comprises false alerts, and true alerts form only a small proportion. Consequently, a naive engine that classifies all security alerts into the majority class can yield a superficial high accuracy close to 100%. Without any correction for the class imbalance, the false alerts will dominate algorithmic predictions resulting in poor generalization performance. We propose a machine-learning approach to address the class imbalance problem in multi-appliance security alert data and automate the security alert analysis process performed in security operations centers (SOCs). We first used the neighborhood cleaning rule (NCR) to identify and remove ambiguous, noisy, and redundant false alerts. Then, we applied the support vector machine synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVMSMOTE) to generate synthetic training true alerts. Finally, we fit and evaluated the decision tree and random forest classifiers.

Aiming at the problem of ""poor quality"" of data and ""difficult to select"" structural parameters of the identification model, a method is proposed to integrate data cleaning in order to select effective learning samples and optimize the selection of the structural parameters of the deep belief network (DBN) model. First, by calculating the relative energy fluctuation value of the finite number of intrinsic function components using the variational modal decomposition of the rolling bearing vibration data, the proportion of each component containing the fault component is characterized. Then, high-quality learning samples are obtained through screening and reconstruction to achieve the effective cleaning of vibration data. Second, the improved particle swarm algorithm (IPSO) is used to optimize the number of nodes in each hidden layer of the DBN model in order to obtain the optimal structural parameters of the intelligent diagnosis model. Finally, the high-quality learning samples obtained from data cleaning are used as input to construct an intelligent identification model for rolling bearing faults. The results showed that the proposed method not only screens out the intrinsic mode function components that contain the fault effective components in the rolling bearing vibration data, but also finds the optimal solution for the number of nodes in the DBN hidden layer, which improves bearing state identification accuracy by 3%.  2022 by the authors.

Based on this view, we present PClean, a unified generative modeling architecture for cleaning and normalizing dirty data in diverse domains. Given an unclean dataset and a probabilistic program encoding relevant domain knowledge, PClean learns a structured representation of the data as a relational database of interrelated objects, and uses this latent structure to impute missing values, identify duplicates, detect errors, and propose corrections in the original data table. PClean makes three modeling and inference contributions: (i) a domain-general non-parametric generative model of relational data, for inferring latent objects and their network of latent connections; (ii) a domain-specific probabilistic programming language, for encoding domain knowledge specific to each dataset being cleaned; and (iii) a domain-general inference engine that adapts to each PClean program by constructing data-driven proposals used in sequential Monte Carlo and particle Gibbs. We show empirically that short ( 50-line) PClean programs deliver higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data cleaning systems based on machine learning and weighted logic; that PCleans inference algorithm is faster than generic particle Gibbs inference for probabilistic programs; and that PClean scales to large real-world datasets with millions of rows.

One of the most important challenges is the learning in imbalanced datasets. The imbalanced data generally refers to a classification problem where the number of data samples per class is not equally distributed. Typically there is a large amount of data for one class (referred to as the majority class) and much fewer data for the other class (referred to as the minority class). In such datasets, learning algorithms are biased toward learning the majority class to reach better accuracy, which leads to the lack of learning in minority class data. This article first introduces a method called neighbor competition scoring (NCS) for assigning scores to samples. Each data point is assigned a lower score if it is farther away from its class samples or closer to the samples of other classes. Then, with the help of these scores, neighbor competition undersampling (NCU) method is presented for undersampling the majority class samples that are less important than other samples. The proposed method has been compared with some popular data-based methods in 10 datasets and has performed better according to the experiments.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:09:40","2022-07-30 22:44:42","","475-482","","","","","","","2020 10h International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering, ICCKE 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Mashhad, Iran","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE50421.2020.9303625","Machine learning; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Nearest neighbor search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there are many tools to facilitate the implementation and application of custom ML analyses (e.g. the scikit-learn library in Python). There is also increasing interest in automated ML packages, which can make it easier for non-experts to apply ML and have the potential to improve model performance. ML has made its way into most subfields of biomedical research with varying levels of rigor and correct usage. The tremendous opportunities offered by ML are frequently offset by the challenge of assembling a comprehensive analysis pipeline, and the ease of ML misuse, e.g. failing to investigate underlying biases in data sources. In this work we have laid out and assembled a complete, rigorous ML analysis pipeline focused on binary classification (i.e. case/control prediction), and applied this pipeline to both simulated and real world data. At a high level, thisautomated but customizable pipeline includes a) exploratory analysis, b) data cleaning and transformation, c) feature selection, d) model training with 9 established ML algorithms, each with hyperparameter optimization, and e) thorough evaluation, including appropriate metrics, statistical analyses, and novel visualizations. This pipeline organizes the many subtle complexities of ML pipeline assembly to illustrate best practices to avoid bias and ensure reproducibility. Additionally, this pipeline is the first to compare established ML algorithms toExSTraCS, a rule-based ML algorithm with the unique capability of interpretably modeling heterogeneous patterns of association. While designed to be widely applicable we apply this pipeline to an epidemiological investigation of established and newly identified risk factors for pancreatic cancer to evaluate how different sources of bias might be handled by ML algorithms.

In an attempt to guarantee data quality, various data cleaning approaches have been proposed to filter out abnormal data entries based on the global data distribution. However, most existing data cleaning approaches are based on a centralized paradigm and thus cannot be applied to future edge-based IoT applications, where each edge node (EN) has only a limited view of the global data distribution. Moreover, the increasing demand for privacy preservation largely prevents ENs from combining their data for centralized cleaning. In this study, we propose a federated data cleaning protocol, coined as FedClean, for edge intelligence (EI) scenarios that is designed to achieve data cleaning without compromising data privacy. More specifically, different ENs first generate Boolean shares of their data and distribute them to two noncolluding servers. These two servers then run the FedClean protocol to privately and efficiently compute the attribute value frequency (AVF) scores of the collected data entries, which are then sorted in ascending order via a bitonic sorting network without revealing their values. As a result, data entries with lower AVF scores are considered as abnormal and filtered out. The security, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are then demonstrated via concrete security analysis and comprehensive experiments.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:40","2022-07-31 03:14:09","","6757-6770","","8","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3027980","Cleaning; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Internet of Things; Data privacy; Data cleaning; Data models; Collaboration; edge intelligence (EI); privacy preserving; Protocols; Servers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An example of such data is metadata for scientific datasets, which should be confirmed by data managers while handling the data.

The system architecture consists of three modules data collection, preprocessing and identification. In the data collection module, the data of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are collected using a smartphone. The preprocessing module includes noise removal, data cleaning, and segmentation. In this module, lost values will be retrieved and data of stopped vehicle will be deleted. Finally, effective statistical properties are extracted from data-windows.

The main purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning method for effective and efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC. Specifically, this research develops machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of HPFRCC through innovative incorporation of micromechanics, aiming to increase the prediction accuracy and generalization performance by enriching and improving the datasets through data cleaning, principal component analysis (PCA), and K-fold cross-validation. This study considers a total of 14 different mix design variables and predicts the ductility of HPFRCC for the first time, in addition to the compressive and tensile strengths. Different types of machine learning methods are investigated and compared, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The results show that the developed machine learning models can reasonably predict the concerned mechanical properties and can be applied to perform parametric studies for the effects of different mix design variables on the mechanical properties.

However, the demand for high-quality training data is slowing down deep neural nets' wider adoption. To this end, data augmentation (DA), which generates more labeled examples from existing ones, becomes a common technique. Meanwhile, the risk of creating noisy examples and the large space of hyper-parameters make DA less attractive in practice. We introduce Rotom, a multi-purpose data augmentation framework for a range of data management and mining tasks including entity matching, data cleaning, and text classification. Rotom features InvDA, a new DA operator that generates natural yet diverse augmented examples by formulating DA as a seq2seq task. The key technical novelty of Rotom is a meta-learning framework that automatically learns a policy for combining examples from different DA operators, whereby combinatorially reduces the hyper-parameters space. Our experimental results show that Rotom effectively improves a model's performance by combining multiple DA operators, even when applying them individually does not yield performance improvement. With this strength, Rotom outperforms the state-of-the-art entity matching and data cleaning systems in the low-resource settings as well as two recently proposed DA techniques for text classification.  2021 ACM.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:40","2022-07-31 04:29:44","","1303-1316","","","","","","","Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Virtual, Online, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3457258","Cleaning; Deep learning; Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Information management; Text mining; entity matching, error detection, data augmentation, deep learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing methods focus more on anomaly detection but not on repairing the detected anomalies. By simply filtering out the dirty data via anomaly detection, applications could still be unreliable over the incomplete time series. Instead of simply discarding anomalies, we propose to (iteratively) repair them in time series data, by creatively bonding the beauty of temporal nature in anomaly detection with the widely considered minimum change principle in data repairing. Our major contributions include: (1) a novel framework of iterative minimum repairing (IMR) over time series data, (2) explicit analysis on convergence of the proposed iterative minimum repairing, and (3) efficient estimation of parameters in each iteration. Remarkably, with incremental computation, we reduce the complexity of parameter estimation from O(n) to O(1).

In this study, a deep learning method to repair atmospheric environmental quality data based on Gaussian diffusion and gate recurrent unit (GD-GRU) was developed to improve repair accuracy. A multi-source Gaussian diffusion model was developed to estimate PM2.5 based on the pollutant diffusion law and the data of 61 stations in Guilin. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated and observed value was extracted as the error sequence. The error value was regarded as output of gate recurrent unit (GRU) with the inputs of weather and pollutant parameters. Missing data were calculated by Gaussian diffusion estimated value and the error predicted by GRU. The established GD-GRU model was applied to repair the long-sequence missing data. The analytical results indicated that the GD-GRU model had higher prediction accuracy of extreme values than Gaussian diffusion model and GRU model, because GD-GRU based on Gaussian diffusion can calculate the extreme value by simulating the diffusion and transmission mechanism. The established model predicted PM2.5 concentration in the next hours with an RMSE of 12.561, which was approximately 21.02% better, on average, than methods like autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory model (LSTM), and GRU. The established GD-GRU model demonstrated good performance on extreme values prediction and air quality data repair, thus providing a new method for air quality long-sequence missing data repair.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:41","2022-07-30 22:21:44","","","","","308","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127446","Long short-term memory; Repair; Deep learning; Errors; Air quality; Mean square error; Gaussian distribution; Diffusion; Data repair; PM2.5; PM; Gaussian diffusion; PREDICTION; MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; OZONE; POLLUTANTS; POLLUTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; TRANSFORMATION; TRANSPORT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we present a new workflow to replace the human knowledge-based analogue studies with data analytics and machine learning techniques. First, we collect reservoir properties, development parameters, and historical recovery data for 1381 actual U.S. oilfields from Tertiary Oil Recovery Information System (TORIS) by U.S. Department of Energy. We conduct extensive data cleaning for outliers and missing values. Then, we determine the most important determining factors for recovery factors. We further use single-variable and bi-variable analysis to understand relationship between recovery factor and determining factors. Finally, we use train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to make recovery factors predictions. We have found that the recovery factors mostly depend on 19 principal factors, a reduction from a total of more than 70 properties originally in TORIS. We randomly select data from 90% of these oilfields as training set for machine learning. The predictability and accuracy of such methodology is tested by making recovery forecasts for the remaining 10% oilfields and by comparing the forecasts with the actual recovery factors. Eventually, the average error in recovery factor predicted by the trained ANN model is about 10%. Overall, this methodology has shown strong performance in computer assisted analogue study, which shows minimum requirements on human knowledge and hands-on work to study these 1381 oilfields. This work provides a new workflow of using data analytics and machine learning techniques for reservoir analogues studies. Reservoir engineering software systematically built based on this methodology can serve as more efficient and accurate predictive tool in studying reservoir analogues.

Thus, the primary aim of fog devices is to ensure the authenticity of incoming network traffic. Anyhow, these fog devices are susceptible to malicious attacks. An efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is necessary to offer secure functioning of fog for improving efficiency. IDSs are a fundamental component for any security system like the Internet of things (IoT) and fog networks for ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS). Even though different machine learning and deep learning models have shown their efficiency in intrusion detection, the deep insight of managing the incremental data is a complex part. Therefore, the main intent of this paper is to implement an effective model for intrusion detection in a fog computing platform. Initially, the data dealing with intrusion are collected from diverse benchmark sources. Further, data cleaning is performed, which is to identify and remove errors and duplicate data, to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables accurate decision making. The conceptual and temporal features are extracted. Concerning reducing the data length for reducing the training complexity, optimal feature selection is performed based on an improved meta-heuristic concept termed Modified Active Electrolocation-based Electric Fish Optimization (MAE-EFO). With the optimally selected features or data, incremental learning-based detection is accomplished by Incremental Deep Neural Network (I-DNN). This deep learning model optimises the testing weight using the proposed MAE-EFO by concerning the objective as to minimise the error difference between the predicted and actual results, thus enhancing the performance of new incremental data. The validation of the proposed model on the benchmark datasets and other datasets achieves an attractive performance when compared over other state-of-the-art IDSs.  2022 World Scientific Publishing Co.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:41","2022-07-31 05:01:00","","","","","","","","","Journal of Information and Knowledge Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: World Scientific","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219649222500423","Feature extraction; Internet of things; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Network security; Benchmarking; Optimization; Intrusion detection; Efficiency; Complex networks; Fish; Fog; Fog computing; Quality of service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the persistent challenges in data analytics is identifying and rectifying dirty data. The outcomes will be unreliable decisions and inaccurate analytics if an individual fails to do so. It is known by a large mass of people that the machine learning model performances are affected by the quality of data. Consequently, a significant amount of time is spent by the scientists on cleaning data before model training. Data pre-processing is considered the fundamental stage of ML methods by countless researchers. Nevertheless, only a fraction of works have paid emphasis on the consequences of data processing techniques. This paper addresses the serious impact that issues of data pre-processing can have on the generality performance of an ML algorithm and here all the pre-processing techniques like removal of missing values with all the possible methods, data binning, and data normalization, etc. are discussed. After performing all the pre-processing techniques, divide the dataset into training and testing datasets and then apply machine learning algorithms.

In the second stage, a residual learning based model is applied to the identified nuclei for subtype classification. Confirmed with cytotechnologist, the proposed model is estimated to efficiently deduct more than 90% annotation burden compared with pixel-wise labeling approach. Moreover, the proposed two-stage approach model outperforms one-stage neural network in segmentation and classification for objects with high similarities in appearance.

This combination, about four million stars, enables us to construct one of the largest training sample for the regression, and further predict reliable stellar temperatures with a root-mean-squared error of 191 K. This result is more precise than that given by Gaia second data release that is based on about sixty thousands stars. After a series of data cleaning processes, the input features that feed the regressor are carefully selected from the Gaia parameters, including the colors, the 3D position and the proper motion. These Gaia parameters is used to predict effective temperatures for 132,739,323 valid stars in the second Gaia data release. We also present a new method for blind tests and a test for external regression without additional data. The machine-learning algorithm fed with the parameters only in one catalog provides us an effective approach to maximize sample size for prediction, and this methodology has a wide application prospect in future studies of astrophysics.

Hyperparameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyperparmeter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.

This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture morphological information in their representation. Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: Scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: A Gamma-Poisson matrix factorizationon substring counts, and a min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: If scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.  2020 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:18","2022-07-31 03:06:00","","1164-1176","","3","34","","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2020.2992529","Cleaning; Machine learning; Factorization; Semantics; Signal encoding; Encoding (symbols); Data models; Encoding; Statistical analysis; autoML; Gamma-Poisson factorization; interpretable machine learning; large-scale data; min-hash; Natural language processing; Statistical learning; string categorical variables; ALGORITHMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning attacks in which noise is added to the input to change the networks' output. Consequently, DNN-based mission-critical applications such as those used in self-driving vehicles have reduced reliability and could cause severe accidents and damage. Moreover, adversarial examples could be used to poison DNN training data, resulting in corruptions of trained models. Besides the need for detecting adversarial examples, correcting them is important for restoring data and system functionality to normal. We have developed methods for detecting and correcting adversarial images that use multiple image processing operations with multiple parameter values. For detection, we devised a statistical-based method that outperforms the feature squeezing method. For correction, we devised a method that uses for the first time two levels of correction. The first level is label correction, with the focus on restoring the adversarial images' original predicted labels (for use in the current task). The second level is image correction, with the focus on both the correctness and quality of the corrected images (for use in the current and other tasks). Our experiments demonstrated that the correction method could correct nearly 90% of the adversarial images created by classical adversarial attacks and affected only about 2% of the normal images.

Herein, we advocate the use of machine learning at sensor nodes to perform essential data-cleaning operations, to avoid the transmission of corrupted (often unusable) data to the cloud. Starting from a public pollution dataset, we investigate how two machine learning techniques (kNN and missForest) may be embedded on Raspberry Pi to perform data imputation, without impacting the data collection process. Our experimental results demon-strate the accuracy and computational efficiency of edge-learning methods for filling in missing data values in corrupted data series. We find that kNN and missForest correctly impute up to 40% of randomly distributed missing values, with a density distribution of values that is indistinguishable from the benchmark. We also show a trade-off analysis for the case of bursty missing values, with recoverable blocks of up to 100 samples.

Automatic and accurate tongue color classification is an important content of the objectification of tongue diagnosis. Due to the vagueness of the visual boundaries between different types of tongue colors and the subjectivity of the doctors, the annotated tongue image data samples often contain noises, which has a negative effect on the training of the tongue color classification model. Therefore, in this paper, a tongue color classification method in TCM with noisy labels is proposed. Firstly, a two-stage data cleaning method is proposed to identify and clean noisy labeled samples. Secondly, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the channel attention mechanism is designed in this paper to achieve accurate classification of tongue color by enhancing the expressiveness of features. Finally, a knowledge distillation strategy with a noise sample filtering mechanism is proposed. This strategy adds a noise sample filtering mechanism led by the teacher network to eliminate further noise samples. At the same time, the teacher network is used to guide the training of the light convolutional neural network to improve the classification performance.The experimental results on the self-established TCM tongue color classification dataset show that the proposed method in this paper can significantly improve the classification accuracy with lower computational complexity, reaching 93.88%.  2022, Science Press.

However, UI layouts in existing datasets are often noisy, have mismatches with their visual representation, or consists of generic or app-specific types that are difficult to analyze and model. In this paper, we propose the CLAY pipeline that uses a deep learning approach for denoising UI layouts, allowing us to automatically improve existing mobile UI layout datasets at scale. Our pipeline takes both the screenshot and the raw UI layout, and annotates the raw layout by removing incorrect nodes and assigning a semantically meaningful type to each node. To experiment with our data-cleaning pipeline, we create the CLAY dataset of 59,555 human-annotated screen layouts, based on screenshots and raw layouts from Rico, a public mobile UI corpus. Our deep models achieve high accuracy with F1 scores of 82.7% for detecting layout objects that do not have a valid visual representation and 85.9% for recognizing object types, which significantly outperforms a heuristic baseline.

Then, iteratively, blocks are collected from the partitioning of images via the codec including the neural networks trained at the previous iteration, each paired with its context, and the neural networks are retrained on the new pairs. Thanks to this training, the neural networks can learn intra prediction functions that both stand out from those already in the initial codec and boost the codec in terms of rate-distortion. Moreover, the iterative process allows the design of training data cleansings essential for the neural network training.

As a result of that situation, advanced pre-processing and analysis of collected data became a crucial topic for extracting meaningful patterns hidden in the data. Therefore, traditional machine learning algorithms generally fail to gather satisfactory results when analyzing complex data. The main reason of this situation is the difficulty of capturing multiple characteristics of the high dimensional data. Within this scope, ensemble learning enables the integration of diversified single models to produce weak predictive results. The final combination is generally achieved by various voting schemes. On the other hand, if a large amount of single models are utilized, voting mechanism cannot be able to combine these results. At this point, Deep Learning (DL) provides the combination of the ensemble results in a considerable time. Apart from previous studies, we determine various predictive models in order to forecast the outcome of two different case studies. Consequently, data cleaning and feature selection are conducted in advance and three predictive models are defined to be combined. DL based integration is applied substituted for voting mechanism. The weak predictive results are fused based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) using different parameters and datasets and best predictors are extracted. After that, different experimental combinations are evaluated for gathering better prediction results. For comparison, grouped individual results (clusters) with proper parameters are compared with DL based ensemble results.  2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Most of the existing works focus on compressing encoder-based models (tiny-BERT, distilBERT, distilRoBERTa, etc), however, to the best of our knowledge, the compression of decoder-based models (such as GPT-2) has not been investigated much.

The training time of our compressed model is significantly less than DistilGPT-2, but it can achieve better performance when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

RPT is pre-trained for a tuple-to-tuple model by corrupting the input tuple and then learning a model to reconstruct the original tuple. It adopts a Transformer-based neural translation architecture that consists of a bidirectional encoder (similar to BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (similar to GPT), leading to a generalization of both BERT and GPT. The pre-trained RPT can already support several common data preparation tasks such as data cleaning, auto-completion and schema matching. Better still, RPT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of data preparation tasks, such as value normalization, data transformation, data annotation, etc. To complement RPT, we also discuss several appealing techniques such as collaborative training and few-shot learning for entity resolution, and few-shot learning and NLP question-answering for information extraction.

Active learning is one way to address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection latencies by up to 10 without affecting the quality of the model.

Novelty detection is one of the classic challenges in Machine Learning and a core component of several research areas such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, data cleaning, and fault prevention. While numerous algorithms were designed to address this problem, most methods are only suitable to model continuous numerical data. Tackling datasets composed of mixed-type features, such as numerical and categorical data, or temporal datasets describing discrete event sequences is a challenging task. In addition to the supported data types, the key criteria for efficient novelty detection methods are the ability to accurately dissociate novelties from nominal samples, the interpretability, the scalability and the robustness to anomalies located in the training data. In this thesis, we investigate novel ways to tackle these issues. In particular, we propose (i) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for mixed-type data (ii) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for sequence data, (iii) a probabilistic nonparametric novelty detection method for mixed-type data based on Dirichlet process mixtures and exponential-family distributions and (iv) an autoencoder-based novelty detection model with encoder/decoder modelled as deep Gaussian processes. We first propose to model mixed -type features with a nonparametric mixture of exponential family distributions. The resulting algorithm is a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model. We compare this method against a wide set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection. The selected methods are benchmarked on publicly available datasets and novel industrial datasets from the company Amadeus. We further run extensive scalability, memory consumption and robustness tests in order to build a full overview of the algorithms characteristics.","2019-03-05","2022-06-10 02:10:20","2022-07-31 14:28:40","","164 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","pattern clustering; unsupervised learning; Gaussian processes; mixture models; nonparametric statistics; probability; security of data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the perennial challenges in data analytics is the detection and handling of non-valid data. Failing to do so can result in creating imbalanced observations that can cause bias and influence estimates, and in extreme cases, can even lead to inaccurate analytics and unreliable decisions. Usually, the process of data cleaning is time-consuming due to its growing volume, velocity, and variety. Further, the complexity and difficulty of the cleaning process increase with the amount of data to be analyzed. It is rarely the case that any real-world data is clean and error-free. Thus, pre-processing the data before using it for analysis has become standard practice. This paper is intended to provide an easy-to-use and reliable system which automates the cleaning process for univariate time series data. Also, automating the process reduces the time required for cleaning it. Another issue that the proposed system aims to solve is making the visualization of a large amount of data more effective. To tackle these issues, an R package, cleanTS is proposed. The proposed system provides a way to analyze data on different scales and resolutions. Also, it provides users with tools and a benchmark system for comparing various techniques used in data cleaning.  2022 The Author(s)","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:20","2022-07-31 14:36:02","","155-176","","","500","","Neurocomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.05.057","Cleaning; Data handling; Machine learning; Data Analytics; Time series analysis; Data visualization; Bleaching; Harmonic analysis; Data cleaning; AutoML; Time series cleaning; BIG DATA; ANALYTICS; BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE; MISSING VALUE IMPUTATION; R PACKAGE; STATE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous works detected noisy labels by analyzing the predicted probability distribution generated by the model trained on the same data and calculating the probabilities of each label to be regarded as noise. However, the predicted probability distribution from the whole dataset may introduce overfitting, and the overfitting on noisy labels may induce the probability distribution of clean and noisy items to be not conditional independent, making identification more challenging. Additionally, label noise reduction on image datasets has received much attention, while label noise reduction on text datasets has not. This paper proposes a noisy label reduction method for text datasets, which could be applied at retrieval-based tasks by getting a conditional independent probability distribution to identify noisy labels accurately. The method first generates a candidate set containing noisy labels, predicts the category probabilities by the model trained on the rest cleaner data, and then identifies noisy items by analyzing a confidence matrix. Moreover, we introduce a warm-up module and a sharpened cross-entropy loss function for efficiently training in the first stage. Empirical results on different rates of uniform and random label noise in five text datasets demonstrate that our method can improve the label noise reduction accuracy and end-to-end classification accuracy. Further, we find that the iteration of the label noise reduction method is efficient to high-rate label noise datasets, and our method will not hurt clean datasets too much.  2022 ACM.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:20","2022-07-31 14:02:16","","526-534","","","","","","","WSDM 2022 - Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3488560.3498482","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Noise abatement; Iterative methods; Probability distributions; Data reduction; Text processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Out of the roughly 73,000,000 instances contained in this dataset, only about 0.013% represents normal traffic, which indicates that the issue of class imbalance should not be ignored for Bot-IoT. Our contribution includes several important findings based on works that address the imbalance in this dataset. In general, we noted the excellent performance of a diverse range of trained models. This suggests Bot-IoT is a reliable dataset that is relatively easy to classify. We also observed that information on data cleaning was left out in a few papers, thus making it challenging for outside researchers to reproduce experiments from these works. Finally, we noted the popularity of both data-level and algorithm-level approaches for mitigating class imbalance in Bot-IoT.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:20","2022-07-31 05:20:56","","143-148","","","","","","","Proceedings - IEEE 7th International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications, BigDataService 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Online, United kingdom","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00023","Big data; Cleaning; Machine learning; Classification (of information); Feature extraction; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; machine learning; big data; intrusion detection; Tools; Classification algorithms; Bot-IoT; class imbalance; internet of things; Network intrusion detection; Performance evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our paper we propose an unsupervised approach for entity matching problem using an improved version of genetic algorithm.

The development of Internet-of-Things has spawned novel ways for heart monitoring but also presented new challenges for manual arrhythmia detection. An automated method is highly demanded to provide support for physicians. Current attempts for automatic arrhythmia detection can roughly be divided as feature-engineering based and deep-learning based methods. Most of the feature-engineering based methods are suffering from adopting single classifier and use fixed features for classifying all five types of heartbeats. This introduces difficulties in identification of the problematic heartbeats and limits the overall classification performance. The deep-learning based methods are usually not evaluated in a realistic manner and report overoptimistic results which may hide potential limitations of the models. Moreover, the lack of consideration of frequency patterns and the heart rhythms can also limit the model performance. To fill in the gaps, we propose a framework for arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs. The framework consists of two modules: a data cleaning module and a heartbeat classification module. Specifically, we propose two solutions for the heartbeat classification task, namely Dynamic Heartbeat Classification with Adjusted Features (DHCAF) and Multi-channel Heartbeat Convolution Neural Network (MCHCNN). DHCAF is a feature-engineering based approach, in which we introduce dynamic ensemble selection (DES) technique and develop a result regulator to improve classification performance. MCHCNN is deep-learning based solution that performs multi-channel convolutions to capture both temporal and frequency patterns from heartbeat to assist the classification. We evaluate the proposed framework with DHCAF and with MCHCNN on the well-known MIT-BIH-AR database, respectively. The results reported in this paper have proven the effectiveness of our framework.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:20","2022-07-30 22:28:58","","2835-2850","","5","23","","World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-019-00776-9","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Feature extraction; Internet of things; Diseases; Heart; Convolution; Patient monitoring; ECG; Internet-of-Things; ECG, Dynamic ensemble selection, Deep learning, Cardiac arrhythmia detection, Internet-of-Things, ResNet; MODEL; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; Cardiac arrhythmia detection; COMPETENCE; DYNAMIC CLASSIFIER SELECTION; Dynamic ensemble selection; FEATURES; HEARTBEAT CLASSIFICATION; MIXTURE; ResNet; WAVELET TRANSFORM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oftentimes, such claims are technically correct, but they can still mislead for two reasons. First, data may contain uncertainty and errors. Second, data can be ""fished"" to advance particular positions. In practice, fact-checkers cannot afford to clean all data and must choose to clean what ""matters the most"" to checking a claim. We explore alternative definitions of what ""matters the most"": one is to ascertain claim qualities (by minimizing uncertainty in these measures), while an alternative is just to counter the claim (by maximizing the probability of finding a counterargument). We show whether the two objectives align with each other, with important implications on when fact-checkers should exercise care in selective data cleaning, to avoid potential bias introduced by their desire to counter claims. We develop efficient algorithms for solving the various variants of the optimization problem, showing significant improvements over naive solutions. The problem is particularly challenging because the objectives in the fact-checking context are complex, non-linear functions over data. We obtain results that generalize to a large class of functions, with potential applications beyond fact-checking. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

It is fueled by two key factors. First, data have become increasingly abundant and are often available openly. Enterprises have more data than they can process. Governments are spearheading open data initiatives by setting up data portals such as data.gov and releasing large amounts of data to the public. Second, AI engineering development is becoming increasingly democratized. Open source frameworks have enabled even an individual developer to engineer sophisticated AI systems. But with such ease of use comes the potential for irresponsible use of data.Ensuring that AI systems adhere to a set of ethical principles is one of the major problems of our age. We believe that data and model transparency has a key role to play in mitigating the deleterious effects of AI systems. In this article, we describe a framework to synthesize ideas from various domains such as data transparency, data quality, data governance among others to tackle this problem. Specifically, we advocate an approach based on automated annotations (of both data and the AI model), which has a number of appealing properties. The annotations could be used by enterprises to get visibility of potential issues, prepare data transparency reports, create and ensure policy compliance, and evaluate the readiness of data for diverse downstream AI applications.

We show that for structured distributions, methods that leverage the structure yield information theoretically more accurate mean estimation.

It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem.

Many of these are predestined to fail from the beginning. In traditional software engineering, this problem is addressed via a feasibility study, an indispensable step before developing any software system. In this paper, we present Snoopy, with the goal of supporting data scientists and machine learning engineers performing a systematic and theoretically founded feasibility study before building ML applications. We approach this problem by estimating the irreducible error of the underlying task, also known as the Bayes error rate (BER), which stems from data quality issues in datasets used to train or evaluate ML model artifacts. We design a practical Bayes error estimator that is compared against baseline feasibility study candidates on 6 datasets (with additional real and synthetic noise of different levels) in computer vision and natural language processing. Furthermore, by including our systematic feasibility study with additional signals into the iterative label cleaning process, we demonstrate in end-to-end experiments how users are able to save substantial labeling time and monetary efforts.

Current data cleaning and data readiness assessment practices for machine learning tasks are mostly conducted in an arbitrary manner which limits their reuse and often results in loss of productivity. We introduce the concept of a Data Readiness Report as accompanying documentation to a dataset that allows data consumers to get detailed insights into the quality of data. Data characteristics and challenges on various quality dimensions are identified and documented, keeping in mind the principles of transparency and explainability. The Data Readiness Report also serves as a record of all data assessment operations, including applied transformations. This provides a detailed lineage for data governance and management. In effect, the report captures and documents the actions taken by various personas in a data readiness and assessment workflow. Over time this becomes a repository of best practices and can potentially drive a recommendation system for building automated data readiness workflows on the lines of AutoML [1]. The data readiness report could serve as a valuable asset for organizing and operationalizing data in a Data-as-a-service model as it augments the trust and reliability of the datasets.

This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues. 2021 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:21","2022-07-31 02:23:13","","2443-2454","","3","9","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3096637","Big data; Machine learning; Cloud computing; Internet of things; Digital storage; Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Information management; Data acquisition; Manufacture; Engineering education; Metadata; Security of data; Big Data; Internet of Things; Internet of Things (IoT); Data analysis; Sensor phenomena and characterization; health state monitoring; Intelligent sensors; noisy data cleaning; real-time systems; sensor selection; Smart manufacturing; ANALYTICS; THINGS; INTERNET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These pipelines are composed of operators, which have to be correctly connected and whose hyperparameters must be correctly configured. Unfortunately, it is quite common for certain combinations of datasets, operators, or hyperparameters to cause failures. Diagnosing and fixing those failures is tedious and error-prone and can seriously derail a data scientists workflow. This paper describes an approach for automatically debugging an ML pipeline, explaining the failures, and producing a remediation. We implemented our approach, which builds on a combination of AutoML and SMT, in a tool called Maro. Maro works seamlessly with the familiar data science ecosystem including Python, Jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn, and AutoML tools such as Hyperopt. We empirically evaluate our tool and find that for most cases, a single remediation automatically fixes errors, produces no additional faults, and does not significantly impact optimal accuracy nor time to convergence.

These insights guide further analytic approaches to the data and support data visualization. In this work we focus on company entity matching, where company name, location and industry are taken into account. Our contribution is an end-to-end, highly scalable, enterprise-grade system that uses rule-based linkage algorithms extended with a machine learning approach to account for short company names. Linkage time is greatly reduced by efficient decomposition of the search space using MinHash. High linkage accuracy is achieved by the proposed thorough scoring process of the matching candidates.

GPS data are typically collected by smartphones apps, which are restricted to small samples of the population. Cellular signaling data (CSD) are usually collected by mobile network operators, which enables researchers to conduct travel behavior analysis of the entire population at a relatively low cost compared to GPS. However, extracting travel mode information from CSD is particularly challenging due to the noise data and low positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a travel mode identification framework based on CSD, which includes data cleansing and travel mode identification. In terms of data cleansing, oscillation sequence and drift data are mainly cleansed. For the oscillation sequence, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on time window. For the drift data, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on distance, velocity and frequency. In terms of travel mode identification, the task is divided into two dichotomous problems: motor and non-motor transport identification and public and private transport identification. Each dichotomous problem proposes an algorithm that does not rely on the ground truth dataset for model training. Finally, a ground truth dataset is constructed to verify all algorithms. The result shows that, in terms of data cleansing, the similarity between CSD after cleansing and the actual trajectory according to DTW improved by 101.13% on average. In terms of travel mode identification, the proposed method can achieve similar or even better accuracy than traditional supervised-learning algorithms (94% in motor and non-motor transport identification, 83.5% in public and private transport identification), which can be directly applied to large-scale population analysis scenarios.  2022 Jiatao Chen et al.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:22","2022-07-31 01:44:57","","","","","2022","","Mobile Information Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Hindawi Limited","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2113213","Global positioning system; Population statistics; Signal detection; CLASSIFICATION; PHONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present an approach to address these issues identifying the future and current values of customers. This helps in identifying and retaining the customers that a firm can most profitably serve. In our proposed system, we purify data through pre-processing and data cleaning, and then three key parameters i.e. recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) are extracted from data. A Analytical Hierarchical Process is then applied to calculate the weights of RFM. These weighted RFM parameters are used for categorization of customers with the help of a fuzzy-c-mean algorithm. The validity of clusters is checked with Davies-Bouldin Index and finally, classification is done using decision tree and recommendation is given to enhance customer relationships.

In this work, we propose a graph-based approach for detecting tables in document images. Instead of using the raw content (recognized text), we make use of the location, context and content type, thus it is purely a structure perception approach, not dependent on the language and the quality of the text reading. Our framework makes use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in order to describe the local repetitive structural information of tables in invoice documents. Our proposed model has been experimentally validated in two invoice datasets and achieved encouraging results.

However, inconsistency and incomplete information are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, and their impact on ML applications remains elusive. In this paper, we present a formal study of this impact by extending the notion of Certain Answers for Codd tables, which has been explored by the database research community for decades, into the field of machine learning. Specifically, we focus on classification problems and propose the notion of ""Certain Predictions"" (CP) - a test data example can be certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of all possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same prediction. We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines whether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the number of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given that general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without assumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP queries can be developed - we show that it is possible to answer both queries in linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds. We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of ""data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML)."" We show that our proposed CPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of classification accuracy with mild manual cleaning effort.

In BNAS, the single-path sampling-updating strategy of an overparameterized BCNN leads to terrible unfair training issue, which restricts the efficiency improvement. To mitigate the unfair training issue, we employ a continuous relaxation strategy to optimize all paths of the overparameterized BCNN simultaneously. However, continuous relaxation leads to a performance collapse issue that leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned BCNN. For that, we propose the confident learning rate (CLR) and introduce the combination of partial channel connections and edge normalization. Experimental results show that 1) BNAS-v2 delivers state-of-the-art search efficiency on both CIFAR-10 (0.05 GPU days, which is 4x faster than BNAS) and ImageNet (0.19 GPU days) with better or competitive performance; 2) the above two solutions are effectively alleviating the performance collapse issue; and 3) BNAS-v2 achieves powerful generalization ability on multiple transfer tasks, e.g., MNIST, FashionMNIST, NORB, and SVHN.

Given the increasing amount of data being generated on the internet in Africa today, and the multilingual state of African countries, we evaluated how well the standard pipeline works when applied to text wholly or partially written in indigenous African languages, specifically Bantu languages. We carried out an exploratory investigation using Twitter data and compared the outputs from each step of the pipeline for an English dataset and a mixed Bantu language dataset.

Meanwhile, the quality of mobile games has been continuously drawing more and more attention, which can greatly affect the player experience. For better quality assurance, general-purpose testing has been extensively studied for mobile apps. However, due to the unique characteristic of mobile games, existing mobile testing techniques may not be directly suitable and applicable. To better understand the challenges in mobile game testing, in this paper, we first initiate an early step to conduct an empirical study towards understanding the challenges and pain points of mobile game testing process at our industrial partner NetEase Games. Specifically, we first conduct a survey from the mobile test development team at NetEase Games via both scrum interviews and questionnaires. We found that accurate and effective GUI widget detection for mobile games could be the pillar to boost the automation of mobile game testing and other downstream analysis tasks in practice. We then continue to perform comparative studies to investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art general-purpose mobile app GUI widget detection methods in the context of mobile games. To this end, we also develop a technique to automatically collect GUI widgets region information of industrial mobile games, which is equipped with a heuristic-based data cleaning method for quality refinement of the labeling results. Our evaluation shows that: (1) Existing GUI widget detection methods for general-purpose mobile apps cannot perform well on industrial mobile games. (2) Mobile game exhibits obvious difference from other general-purpose mobile apps in the perspective GUI widgets. Our further in-depth analysis reveals high diversity and density characteristics of mobile game GUI widgets could be the major reasons that post the challenges for existing methods, which calls for new research methods and better industry practices. To enable further research along this line, we construct the very first GUI widget detection benchmark, specially designed for mobile games, incorporating both our collected dataset and the state-of-the-art widget detection methods for mobile apps, which could also be the basis for further study of many downstream quality assurance tasks (e.g., testing and analysis) for mobile games.  2021 ACM.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:23","2022-07-31 02:20:03","","1427-1437","","","","","","","ESEC/FSE 2021 - Proceedings of the 29th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3468264.3473935","Deep learning; Surveys; Quality control; Testing; Quality assurance; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Graphical user interfaces; Heuristic methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Novelty detection is one of the classic challenges in Machine Learning and a core component of several research areas such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, data cleaning, and fault prevention. While numerous algorithms were designed to address this problem, most methods are only suitable to model continuous numerical data. Tackling datasets composed of mixed-type features, such as numerical and categorical data, or temporal datasets describing discrete event sequences is a challenging task. In addition to the supported data types, the key criteria for efficient novelty detection methods are the ability to accurately dissociate novelties from nominal samples, the interpretability, the scalability and the robustness to anomalies located in the training data. In this thesis, we investigate novel ways to tackle these issues. In particular, we propose (i) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for mixed-type data (ii) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for sequence data, (iii) a probabilistic nonparametric novelty detection method for mixed-type data based on Dirichlet process mixtures and exponential-family distributions and (iv) an autoencoder-based novelty detection model with encoder/decoder modelled as deep Gaussian processes. We first propose to model mixed-type features with a nonparametric mixture of exponential-family distributions. The resulting algorithm is a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model. We compare this method against a wide set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection. The selected methods are benchmarked on publicly available datasets and novel industrial datasets from the company Amadeus. We further run extensive scalability, memory consumption and robustness tests in order to build a full overview of the algorithms' characteristics. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Later, various results are obtained to reflect different consumption patterns within a profile group by the selected distance measurement methods such as Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping.

Further, several lines of recent work have argued that critical opportunities for improving data quality and representativeness, controlling for bias, and allowing humans to oversee and impact computational processes are missed if we do not consider the lifecycle stages upstream from model training and deployment. Yet, very little has been done to date to provide system-level support to data scientists who wish to develop and deploy responsible machine learning methods. We aim to fill this gap and present FairPrep, a design and evaluation framework for fairness-enhancing interventions.

As part of our contribution, we identify shortcomings in existing empirical studies for analyzing fairness-enhancing interventions. We then show how FairPrep can be used to measure the impact of sound best practices, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling. In particular, our results suggest that the high variability of the outcomes of fairness-enhancing interventions observed in previous studies is often an artifact of a lack of hyperparameter tuning.

Some existing techniques tend to fix data errors using machine learning, statistics, integrity constraints, while others use multiple iterations to find data errors and a long time to repair them. Researches have shown the data cleaning accuracy is not efficient using those techniques. Thus to improve the accuracy, some works provided mechanisms employing knowledge bases (kbs) and crowdsourcing platforms, but using only single tables to achieve that. In this work a data error repair mechanism is proposed, which involves the use of a knowledge base on an entire database system having common attributes among its tables. Thorough experiments showed the effectiveness of the mechanism, with results showing the proposed technique is more efficient and effective using the whole database as compared to data repairs done on single tables.  2021 ACM.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:24","2022-07-31 05:56:00","","36-45","","","","","","","ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Sanya, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3456529.3456536","Data handling; Errors; Knowledge based systems; Information analysis; Data warehouses; Data quality, Database., Knowledge Base, Data Error Repair; Database., Knowledge Base, Data quality, Data Error Repair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regarded as experts by senior management, estimators are among the most valued resources, and nonetheless, human. Over time, estimators learn from mistakes, and get better with tenure at sharpening assessments. When estimators retire without having groomed an apprentice, shipyards may be at risk of losing a lot of know-how, all at once. These shipyards may well find very costly to experience, for a while, estimating skills stepping back on the learning curve. Yet, even shipyards relying on less advanced information technology may have unwittingly accumulated a lot of valuable data relevant to ship maintenance and repair works. These shipyards may overlook how easily accessible knowledge can be turned into a competitive advantage through predictive analytics. Not only can this data be literally mined, but machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), can now process it for a speedy and preliminary estimate through faster and cheaper computing power. To be clear, the purpose is not to replace the human estimator but to help the expert quickly assess, when times are busy, whether to bid or not on a specific project opportunity. In the absence of The Master Estimator, an Apprentice may also look for a quick and cheap sanity check of the prepared estimate before submitting a bid. The study carried out in this article is based on all ship maintenance and repair data recorded at a single North American shipyard over the last 19 years since the current information systems were implemented. This raw data extract with all directly paid hours logged daily by workers on 1277 ship maintenance and repair projects was screened through advanced data cleansing. To enrich the cleansed data tables, additional independent variables were subsequently collected internally and externally to develop a trainingtesting data set. The final 657 projects represent 136 vessels regrouped in eight types, for which 28 other independent variables were all made available for training up to testing simple ANN models. The scope of this article is limited to the estimation of the direct labor required to complete ship maintenance and repair projects on a specific type of vessels for which workforce planning and tactical pricing was deemed the most relevant to keep the business afloat.  2022 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

However, such multi-source heterogenous data typically contain low-quality data, e.g., missing values, which may result in potential risks. Besides, resource-constrained devices incur large latency in edge computing networks. To alleviate such latency, distributed task offloading schemes are designed to share the computation burden between edge nodes and nearby servers. However, there are three main drawbacks of such schemes. First, low-quality data are not carefully evaluated by constraints under scenarios, which may result in slow convergence in distributed computation. Second, multi-source data including sensitive information are computed and shared among edge nodes without privacy protection. Third, distributed tasks on low-quality data may result in low-quality results even with an optimal offloading scheme. To address the problems above, a task offloading framework for edge computing based on consortium blockchain and distributed reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which can provide high-quality task offloading policies with data privacy protected. This framework consists of three key components: data quality evaluation (DQ) with multiple data quality dimensions, data repairing (DR) with a repairing algorithm based on a novel repairing consensus mechanism and distributed reinforcement learning for task arrangement (DELTA) with a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm based on a novel low-quality data distributing strategy. Numeric results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed task offloading framework for edge computing on low-quality data in the IoE.  1983-2012 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:24","2022-07-31 14:42:37","","657-676","","2","40","","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3118417","Repair; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Quality control; Blockchain; Edge computing; Data privacy; Task analysis; Data integrity; Blockchains; consortium blockchain; data quality; distributed learning; Internet of energy; Organizations; task offloading; ALLOCATION; IOT; RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION; THINGS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:24","2022-07-31 02:37:08","","4 pp.","","","","","","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp).

In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model to address ETA prediction problem by application of supervised learning methods based on multisource data. The proposed model consists of two parts: spatiotemporal trajectories storage and clustering-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering, re-sampling and data storage, we increase the dimension of trajectory variable. Then, the discrete track points are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using real-time data cross validation, the model is trained to find out the different prediction factor of ETA for each individual cluster cell under various conditions. Finally, the predicted ETA for each flight is generated. Lots of validation work has been approached with this model.

Adopting deep learning techniques has the potential to lessen these challenges. In this paper, we set out to devise an entity resolution method that builds on the robustness conferred by deep autoencoders to reduce human-involvement costs. Specifically, we reduce the cost of training deep entity resolution models by performing unsupervised representation learning. This unveils a transferability property of the resulting model that can further reduce the cost of applying the approach to new datasets by means of transfer learning. Finally, we reduce the cost of labeling training data through an active learning approach that builds on the properties conferred by the use of deep autoencoders.

According to the typical application scenarios of the power industry, targeted automatic selection and fusion are carried out on the basis of pre-processed power big data. In terms of data cleaning, a universal and effective cleaning solution based on commonly used data mining requirements is proposed. In order to improve the data cleaning efficiency and accuracy, an algorithm for missing value verification based on machine learning is proposed.

RSSI data preparation is very important in predictive modeling machine learning projects, such as classification and regression, so that the algorithm can model it based on the right conditions, because the data has a more specific part but does not necessarily affect the algorithm performance. RSSI data were collected from the Dinamika Bangsa University Campus building, namely 225 reference points. The two main processes involved in data compilation, namely construction data and data cleaning. From the process of identifying a column containing a single RSSI value, several unique values were found in each column in the RSSI data table. Since no column has a Single Value, no columns are deleted. Then in the process of deleting columns that have low RSSI variance, the input is 5969 rows and 18 columns. The output is 5969 rows and 3 columns. However, the number of columns that passed the Low Variance selection was 5969 rows and 18 columns, meaning that all columns in the dataset have high variance. Additionally, no duplicate RSSI data were found. It can be said that the result of the overall preparation of this data set is the RSSI data used in good condition and can be used for machine learning needs.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:25","2022-07-31 04:29:26","","284-289","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2nd International Conference on Informatics, Multimedia, Cyber, and Information System, ICIMCIS 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Jakarta, Indonesia","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIMCIS51567.2020.9354273","Cleaning; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Information use; Information systems; Data models; Predictive models; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Classification algorithms; Constructing; Data; Preparation; RSSI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We envision that human-easy data preparation for relational data can be automated. To this end, we first identify the desiderata for computers to achieve near-human intelligence for data preparation: computers need a deep-learning architecture (or model) that can read and understand millions of tables; computers require unsupervised learning to perform self-learning without labeled data, and can gain knowledge from existing tasks and previous experience; and computers desire few-shot learn-ing that can adjust to new tasks with a few examples. Our proposal is called Relational Pretrained Transformers (RPTs), a general framework for various data preparation tasks, which typically consists of the following models/methods: (1) transformer, a general and powerful deep-learning model, that can read tables/texts/images;(2) masked language model for self-learning and collaborative train-ing for transferring knowledge and experience; and (3) pattern-exploiting training that better interprets a task from a few examples.We further present concrete RPT architectures for three classical data preparation tasks, namely data cleaning, entity resolution, and information extraction.

The optimal cluster number is determined according to the Bayesian Information Criterion and the nearest clustering ratio. The Pauta criterion is used to detect the global outlier and artificial neural network (ANN) is used to fill in outliers and missing values. Finally, the improved data cleaning method is applied to water quality monitoring data of Beijing wastewater treatment plant.

A large corpus of high-quality query and code pairs is demanded to establish a precise mapping from the natural language to the programming language. Due to the limited availability, most widely-used code search datasets are established with compromise, such as using code comments as a replacement of queries. Our empirical study on a famous code search dataset reveals that over one-third of its queries contain noises that make them deviate from natural user queries. Models trained through noisy data are faced with severe performance degradation when applied in real-world scenarios. To improve the dataset quality and make the queries of its samples semantically identical to real user queries is critical for the practical usability of neural code search. In this paper, we propose a data cleaning framework consisting of two subsequent filters: a rule-based syntactic filter and a model-based semantic filter. This is the first framework that applies semantic query cleaning to code search datasets. Experimentally, we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework on two widely-used code search models and three manually-annotated code retrieval benchmarks. Training the popular DeepCS model with the filtered dataset from our framework improves its performance by 19.2% MRR and 21.3% Answer@1, on average with the three validation benchmarks.  2022, CC BY.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:27","2022-07-31 05:05:14","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3510003.3510160","Cleaning; Deep learning; Benchmarking; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; data cleaning; deep learning; Training; Computational modeling; Data models; Benchmark testing; Training data; dataset; code search, dataset, data cleaning, deep learning; Code search; Codes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corrupted data can severely bias the learned model and can also lead to invalid inferences. We present, Picket, a simple framework to safeguard against data corruptions during both training and deployment of machine learning models over tabular data. For the training stage, Picket identifies and removes corrupted data points from the training data to avoid obtaining a biased model. For the deployment stage, Picket flags, in an online manner, corrupted query points to a trained machine learning model that due to noise will result in incorrect predictions. To detect corrupted data, Picket uses a self-supervised deep learning model for mixed-type tabular data, which we call PicketNet. To minimize the burden of deployment, learning a PicketNet model does not require any human-labeled data. Picket is designed as a plugin that can increase the robustness of any machine learning pipeline. We evaluate Picket on a diverse array of real-world data considering different corruption models that include systematic and adversarial noise during both training and testing. We show that Picket consistently safeguards against corrupted data during both training and deployment of various models ranging from SVMs to neural networks, beating a diverse array of competing methods that span from data quality validation models to robust outlier detection models.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:28","2022-07-31 04:49:16","","","","","","","","","VLDB Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00778-021-00699-w","Anomaly detection; Data handling; Deep learning; Error detection; Statistics; Crime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, most of the state-of-health estimation methods require a large amount of laboratory aging data to offer precise results. As obtaining battery aging data under laboratory conditions requires a considerable amount of time and incurs high economic costs, in this paper, a method based on transfer learning is proposed to monitor state-of-health of batteries. A novel data processing method based on maximum mean discrepancy is considered to eliminate redundant information and minimize the difference between different data distributions. Then, mutual information is used to prove that the correlation between processed data is not decreased. To validate the developed transfer learning method, the data sets of four batteries in different working conditions are considered. Different error-detection methods, maximum average error, mean squared error and root mean squared error, which are utilized to evaluate the proposed model. The state of health is estimated effectively with less than 2.5% error considering the aforementioned errors after processed by using semi-supervised transfer component analysis algorithm, although the training set only accounts for about 35% of the entire set. The results indicate that transfer learning plays an important role in improving the estimation accuracy of a battery state-of-health.

However, applying DCA to shale-gas wells is limited by long transient flow, a unique completion design, and high-density drilling. Recently, a long shortterm- memory (LSTM) algorithm has been widely applied to the prediction of time-series data. Because shale-gas-production data are time-series data, the LSTM algorithm can be applied to predict future shale-gas production. After information for 332 shale-gas wells in Alberta, Canada, is obtained from a commercial database, the data are preprocessed in seven steps, including cutoffs for well list, data cleaning, feature extraction, train and test sets split, normalization, and sorting for input into the LSTM model. The LSTM model is trained in 405 seconds by two features of production data and a shut-in (SI) period from 300 wells. The two-feature case shows a better prediction accuracy than both the one-feature case (i.e., production data only) and the hyperbolic DCA, where the three methods are tested on unseen data from 15 wells. The two-feature case can predict future production rates according to the SI period and provide a stable result for available time-series data.  2019 Society of Petroleum Engineers.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:28","2022-07-31 04:40:12","","2423-2437","","6","24","","SPE Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/195698-PA","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Regression analysis; Forecasting; Time series; Gas industry; Gases; Natural gas well completion; Natural gas wells; Shale gas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether intentionally or unintentionally present, noise in training instances causes overfitting while building the classifier and negatively impacts classification accuracy. This paper uses instance reduction techniques for the datasets before mining the association rules and building the classifier. Instance reduction techniques were originally developed to reduce memory requirements in instance-based learning. This paper utilizes them to remove noise from the dataset before training the association rules classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted to assess the accuracy of association rules with different instance reduction techniques, namely:DecrementalReduction Optimization Procedure (DROP) 3, DROP5, ALL K-Nearest Neighbors (ALLKNN), Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN), and Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbor (RENN) in different noise ratios. Experiments show that instance reduction techniques substantially improved the average classification accuracy on three different noise levels: 0%, 5%, and 10%. The RENN algorithm achieved the highest levels of accuracy with a significant improvement on seven out of eight used datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The improvements were more apparent in the 5% and the 10% noise cases. When RENN was applied, the average classification accuracy for the eight datasets in the zero-noise test enhanced from 70.47% to 76.65% compared to the original test. The average accuracy was improved from 66.08% to 77.47% for the 5%-noise case and from 59.89% to 77.59% in the 10%-noise case. Higher confidence was also reported in building the association rules when RENN was used. The above results indicate that RENN is a good solution in removing noise and avoiding overfitting during the construction of the association rules classifier, especially in noisy domains.  2022 Tech Science Press.

Methods: ASL MRI were acquired with 6 PLDs on a 1.5T or 3T GE system in adults with and without cognitive impairment (N=99). Voxel-level CBF and ATT maps were quantified by training models with distinct convolutional neural network architectures: (1) convolutional neural network (CNN) and (2) U-Net. Models were trained and compared via 5-fold cross validation. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE). Model outputs were trained on and compared against a reference ASL model fitting after data cleaning. Minimally processed ASL data served as another benchmark. Model output uncertainty was estimated using Monte Carlo dropout. The better-performing neural network was subsequently re-trained on inputs with missing PLDs to investigate generalizability to different PLD schedules. Results: Relative to the CNN, the U-Net yielded lower MAE on training data. On test data, the U-Net MAE was 8.4  1.4mL/100 g/min for CBF and 0.22  0.09 s for ATT. A significant association was observed between MAE and Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimates. Neural network performance remained stable despite systematically reducing the number of input images (i.e., up to 3 missing PLD images). Mean processing time was 10.77 s for the U-Net neural network compared to 10min 41 s for the reference pipeline. Conclusion: It is feasible to generate CBF and ATT maps from 1.5T and 3T multi-PLD ASL MRI with a fast deep learning image-generation approach.  2022 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:28","2022-07-31 14:52:53","","406-417","","1","88","","Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29193","Deep learning; Network architecture; Blood; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Uncertainty analysis; Monte Carlo methods; deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Blood vessels; Hemodynamics; convolutional neural network; OPTIMIZATION; arterial spin labeling; cerebral blood flow; PERFUSION; REGISTRATION; RESONANCE; ROBUST; SENSITIVITY; transit time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, text is obtained through microblog crawler program. After data preprocessing, including data cleaning, Chinese word segmentation, removal of stop words, and so on, the Skip-gram model is used for word vector training on a large-scale unmarked corpus, and then the trained word vector is used as the text input of CNN-BiLSTM model, which combines Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Considering the historical context information and the subsequent context information, BiLSTM can better use the temporal relationship of text to learn sentence semantics. CNN can extract hidden features from the text and combine them. Finally, after Adamax optimization training, the emotion type of microblog comment text is output. The proposed model combines the learning advantages of BiLSTM and CNN.

Researchers using machine learning often apply some data cleaning techniques to clean up corrupted data. There are two popular methods to clean corrupted data: one is to set manual cleaning rules, and the other is to use positive samples for machine learning or statistical methods. Our work proposes a data cleaning method based on ACGAN since it is difficult to manually formulate cleaning rules, and there are often no positive samples of training data too. Our work does not need to artificially add cleaning rules or positive samples, and subtly uses mode dropping of GAN to eliminate the impact of noisy labels on corrupted data so which can be converted to relatively clean synthetic training data. Mode dropping of ACGAN will naturally happens, which is originally a disadvantage that usually needs to be eliminated in GAN, we tom the disadvantage into advantage, ACGAN will ignore some non-subject features when generating data, so as to eliminate the impact of noisy labels.

Noise parameters are used to vary the total level of class noise and the proportion of class noise between the majority and minority classes. This allows us to better understand how class noise affects imbalanced data sets and where data cleaning efforts should be focused. Four popular machine learning algorithms are evaluated using six rounds of five-fold cross-validation to determine which learners are most robust to class noise. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) results shows that negative class noise, i.e. when positive instances are incorrectly labeled as negative, has the greatest adverse effect on classification performance. Statistical results show that the XGBoost learner performs significantly better than Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression Learners. True positive rates and true negative rates show that there is a trade-off that occurs as the noise proportion switches between the majority and negative classes. Finally, we show that the effects of class label noise can be combatted by regularizing the XGBoost learner through shallower decision trees.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:30","2022-07-31 04:02:19","","1427-1433","","","2021-November","","","","Proceedings - International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI52525.2021.00227","Big data; Machine learning; Decision trees; Logistic regression; Random forests; Crime; Economic and social effects; Health insurance; Big Data; Noise measurement; Machine learning algorithms; Conferences; Multilayer perceptrons; Robustness; Class Imbalance; Class Noise; Fraud Detection; Medicare; Robust Learners; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; FRAUD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven method. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some limitations in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale benchmark on object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. We collected remote sensing images with a resolution of 0.3m to 0.8m from different platforms, which are spread across many countries and regions. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 sub-categories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the quantity of instances and the quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution, (4) it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel evaluation method and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a visual classification task using several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep learning based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results strongly indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is considerably more challenging than existing datasets. Researchers can better investigate fine-grained object detection algorithms with the help of the FAIR1M dataset. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Therefore, deep learning models have been proposed to facilitate this process. Existing approaches utilize a two-stage pipeline: the detection stage for identifying the locations of potential mitotic cells and the classification stage for refining prediction confidences. However, this pipeline formulation can lead to inconsistencies in the classification stage due to the poor prediction quality of the detection stage and the mismatches in training data distributions between the two stages. In this study, we propose a Refine Cascade Network (ReCasNet), an enhanced deep learning pipeline that mitigates the aforementioned problems with three improvements. First, window relocation was used to reduce the number of poor quality false positives generated during the detection stage. Second, object re-cropping was performed with another deep learning model to adjust poorly centered objects. Third, improved data selection strategies were introduced during the classification stage to reduce the mismatches in training data distributions. ReCasNet was evaluated on two large-scale mitotic figure recognition datasets, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT) and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC), which resulted in up to 4.8% percentage point improvements in the F1 scores for mitotic cell detection and 44.1% reductions in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for MC prediction. Techniques that underlie ReCasNet can be generalized to other two-stage object detection networks and should contribute to improving the performances of deep learning models in broad digital pathology applications.

The correct positioning of the implants is strongly related to multiple surgical variables that have a tremendous impact on the success of the surgery. Computer-based navigation systems have been investigated and developed in order to assist the surgeon in accurately controlling those surgical variables. The existing technologies are very costly, require additional bone incisions for fixing markers to be tracked, and these markers are usually bulky, interfering with the standard surgical flow. This work presents a markerless navigation system that supports the surgeon in accurately performing the TKA procedure. The proposed system uses a mobile RGB-D camera for replacing the existing optical tracking systems and does not require markers to be tracked. We combine an effective deep learning-based approach for accurately segmenting the bone surface with a robust geometry-based algorithm for registering the bones with pre-operative models. The favourable performance of our pipeline is achieved by (1) employing a semi-supervised labelling approach for generating training data from real TKA surgery data, (2) using effective data augmentation techniques for improving the generalisation capability and (3) using appropriate depth data cleaning strategies. The construction of this complete markerless registration prototype that generalises for unseen intra-operative data is non-obvious, and relevant insights and future research directions can be derived.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm which solves machine learning tasks over distributed-located data. FL problems are challenging to solve due to the heterogeneity and communication bottleneck. However, it is unclear how these challenges will affect the convergence of Bilevel Optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study Federated Bilevel Optimization problems. Specifically, we first propose the FedBiO, a deterministic gradient-based algorithm and we show it requires O(2) number of iterations to reach an -stationary point. Then we propose FedBiOAcc to accelerate FedBiO with the momentum-based variance-reduction technique under the stochastic scenario. We show FedBiOAcc has complexity of O(1.5).

Firstly, it selects the median and 3 criterion to complete the missing values and clean up the abnormal values of the original electricity consumption data. Then use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and finally use the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the processed data. Through clustering, the users are divided into different clusters, each cluster is equivalent to a user group, and at the same time extract, the typical users of this user group are the representatives of this user category.

The typical practice is to create 'clean' data for analysis, matching entities and merging variants to overcome differences in knowledge representation. Despite progress in data management techniques to automate this process, it still needs labor-intensive supervision from the analyst. In this paper, we evaluate the benefit of advanced statistical tools to address directly many analytic tasks across data sources without such entity-matching cleaning. Reframing analytical questions as machine-learning tasks enables to replace exact matching of entities by continuous descriptions-vectorial embeddings- that expose similarities between entries. But are analyses with less cleaning trustworthy? We answer this question with a thorough benchmark on questions typical of socio-economic studies across 14 employee databases: we compare the approaches based on machine learning to manual data cleaning (entity matching). It reveals that using embeddings and machine learning improves results validity (smaller estimation error) more than manual cleaning, with considerably less human labor. While machine learning is often combined with data management for the purpose of cleaning, our study suggests that using it directly for analysis is beneficial because it captures ambiguities hard to represent during curation.  2013 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:31","2022-07-31 03:31:02","","42420-42431","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168013","Cleaning; Machine learning; Data integration; Embeddings; Information analysis; Job analysis; Statistical mechanics; data integration; data cleaning; Sociology; Task analysis; Manuals; Data analysis; embeddings; entity-matching; Remuneration; Soft sensors; DATA INTEGRATION; DETERMINANTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, odometer is inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices and smartphones. To apply forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Dedicated experiments have been conducted to verify the generalization capability and the precision of the OdoNet. The results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet, while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Hence, a data-cleaning procedure is adopted to effectively mitigate the impacts of the IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the processing mode using only non-holonomic constraint (NHC), by employing the pseudo-odometer, the positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74% for the hardware wheeled odometer.

However, ML models often assume the table structure keeps fixed in training and testing. Before ML modeling, heavy data cleaning is required to merge disparate tables with different columns. This preprocessing often incurs significant data waste (e.g., removing unmatched columns and samples). How to learn ML models from multiple tables with partially overlapping columns? How to incrementally update ML models as more columns become available over time? Can we leverage model pretraining on multiple distinct tables? How to train an ML model which can predict on an unseen table? To answer all those questions, we propose to relax fixed table structures by introducing a Transferable Tabular Transformer (TransTab) for tables. The goal of TransTab is to convert each sample (a row in the table) to a generalizable embedding vector, and then apply stacked transformers for feature encoding. One methodology insight is combining column description and table cells as the raw input to a gated transformer model. The other insight is to introduce supervised and self-supervised pretraining to improve model performance. We compare TransTab with multiple baseline methods on diverse benchmark datasets and five oncology clinical trial datasets. Overall, TransTab ranks 1.00, 1.00, 1.78 out of 12 methods in supervised learning, feature incremental learning, and transfer learning scenarios, respectively; and the proposed pretraining leads to 2.3% AUC lift on average over the supervised learning.  2022, CC BY.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:31","2022-07-31 03:51:44","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.09328","Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a framework based on statistical physics to study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which drives learning in neural networks. Using the minibatch gradient ensemble, we construct order parameters to characterize the dynamics of weight updates in SGD. In the case without mislabeled data, we find that the SGD learning dynamics transitions from a fast learning phase to a slow exploration phase, which is associated with large changes in the order parameters that characterize the alignment of SGD gradients and their mean amplitude. In a more complex case, with randomly mislabeled samples, the SGD learning dynamics falls into four distinct phases. First, the system finds solutions for the correctly labeled samples in phase I; it then wanders around these solutions in phase II until it finds a direction that enables it to learn the mislabeled samples during phase III, after which, it finds solutions that satisfy all training samples during phase IV. Correspondingly, the test error decreases during phase I and remains low during phase II; however, it increases during phase III and reaches a high plateau during phase IV. The transitions between different phases can be understood by examining changes in the order parameters that characterize the alignment of the mean gradients for the two datasets (correctly and incorrectly labeled samples) and their (relative) strengths during learning. We find that individual sample losses for the two datasets are separated the most during phase II, leading to a data cleansing process that eliminates mislabeled samples and improves generalization. Overall, we believe that an approach based on statistical physics and stochastic dynamic systems theory provides a promising framework for describing and understanding learning dynamics in neural networks, which may also lead to more efficient learning algorithms.  2021 The Author(s).","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:31","2022-07-31 04:51:50","","","","4","2","","Machine Learning: Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IOP Publishing Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/abf5b9","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Gradient methods; Stochastic systems; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Alignment; Dynamics; Parameter estimation; Statistical Physics; System theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The renewable energy accommodation is one of the key issues to achieve the energy efficiency in smart grid, which is difficult to obtain dynamic optimal policies due to the intermittency of renewables. To capture statuses of renewable energy for decision-making, large amounts of information in heterogeneous forms are collected by massive end devices deployed in smart grid. Such information not only provides fruitful features for existing learning based algorithms but also incurs high computation complexity. Besides, such heterogeneous data may also contain missing values, which may result in wrong policies by existing algorithms. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge-end orchestrated computing scheme is proposed to efficiently repair missing values and obtain optimal policies in two separate layers. In the first layer, deep learning based algorithms deployed can perceive the characteristics and repair the missing values. In the second layer, deep reinforcement learning based algorithms are employed to obtain optimal policies. Simulations on the real power grid dataset illustrate the effectiveness of proposed fault-tolerant renewable energy accommodation algorithm.

Many research use string similarity as features to infer entity matching but the power of the similarity may be affected by the pairs of hard-to-classify entities, which are actually different entities but have a high similarity or the same entity with low similarity. String transformation is a good solution to solve different representations between two domains of datasets, such as abbreviations, misspellings, and other expressions. In this paper, we propose two powerful features, similarity gain and dissimilarity gain, that enables us to discriminate whether the two entities refer to the same entity after string transformation. The similarity gain is defined by the maximum amount of similarity increase among the variations in similarity before and after applying string transformations. The dissimilarity is defined by the maximum amount of similarity decrease.

Among such efforts, Gu et al. adopted a deep learning method, in particular an RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture, to perform this task and obtained promising results on common APIs in Java. In this work, we aim to reproduce their results and apply the same methods for APIs in Python. Additionally, we compare the performance with a more recent Transformer-based method, i.e., CodeBERT, for the same task. Our experiment reveals a clear drop in performance measures when careful data cleaning is performed.

Therefore, probabilistic (weak) labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called Chef (CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than one big batch of samples. This yields better overall model performance and enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

For this reason, source separation algorithms have become an increasingly important tool in neuroscience and neuroengineering. However, in noisy or highly multivariate recordings these decomposition techniques often make a large number of errors, which degrades human-machine interfacing applications and often requires costly post-hoc manual cleaning of the output label set of spike timestamps. To address both the need for automated post-hoc cleaning and robust separation filters we propose a methodology based on deep metric learning, using a novel loss function which maintains intra-class variance, creating a rich embedding space suitable for both label cleaning and the discovery of new activations. We then validate this method with an artificially corrupted label set based on source-separated high-density surface electromyography recordings, recovering the original timestamps even in extreme degrees of feature and class-dependent label noise.

Software 2.0) where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. As machine learning is used in sensitive applications, it becomes imperative that the trained model is accurate, fair, and robust to attacks. While many techniques have been proposed to improve the model training process (in-processing approach) or the trained model itself (post-processing), we argue that the most effective method is to clean the root cause of error: the data the model is trained on (pre-processing). Historically, there are at least three research communities that have been separately studying this problem: data management, machine learning (model fairness), and security. Although a significant amount of research has been done by each community, ultimately the same datasets must be preprocessed, and there is little understanding how the techniques relate to each other and can possibly be integrated. We contend that it is time to extend the notion of data cleaning for modern machine learning needs. We identify dependencies among the data preprocessing techniques and propose MLClean, a unified data cleaning framework that integrates the techniques and helps train accurate and fair models.

Traditional intrusion detection technologies face problems such as low accuracy, low detection efficiency, high false positive rate, and inability to cope with new types of intrusions. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time network intrusion detection system based on deep learning, which uses big data technology, natural language processing technology and deep learning technology. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) Use Flume as the agent for log collection to realize real-time massive log collection, using Flink as real-time computation engine. (2) Aiming at the high dimensional problem of traffic data, a self-encoder-based intrusion detection dimension reduction method is proposed, and the intrusion detection data is preprocessed, including data cleaning, coding, extraction and integration, and normalization. (3) Propos a deep learning-based intrusion detection model, AE-AlexNet, which uses Auto-Encoder AlexNet neural network. The experimental results of the intrusion detection data set KDD 99 show that the accuracy of the AE-AlexNet, model is as high as 94.32%.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:33","2022-07-31 15:14:07","","1-4","","","2019-October","","","","Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences, ICSESS","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Beijing, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS47205.2019.9040718","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Learning systems; Neural networks; Feature extraction; Network security; Natural language processing systems; Software engineering; Engineering education; Signal encoding; Intrusion detection; Computer viruses; Personal computing; deep learning; adaptive acquisition; intrusion detection; Real-time systems; self-encoder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effective detection of duplicate records is of great significance for improving data quality and is an important issue in the field of data cleaning. At present, traditional duplicate record detection approaches use discrete features to build classification models which cannot express the semantic information well, and the classification accuracy needs to be improved. The deep learning model has good performance in feature extraction and classification. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel two-stage duplicate record detection model based on deep learning. In the first stage, the doc2vec model based on deep learning is applied to attribute vectorization construction, and the vector of record comparison pairs is constructed by concatenating attribute vectors. The second stage uses a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a classification model for all record comparison vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the traditional duplicate record detection method.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:33","2022-07-31 15:42:19","","85-91","","","11817 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Qingdao, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30952-7_10","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Feature extraction; Semantics; Information use; Convolutional neural networks; Information systems; Data cleaning, Deep learning, Duplicate record detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing error detection techniques typically target specific types of errors. Moreover, most of these detection models either require user-defined rules or ample hand-labeled training examples. Therefore, in this article, we present TabReformer, a model that learns bidirectional encoder representations for tabular data. The proposed model consists of two main phases. In the first phase, TabReformer follows encoder architecture with multiple self-attention layers to model the dependencies between cells and capture tuple-level representations. Also, the model utilizes a Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function with the Masked Data Model objective to achieve deeper probabilistic understanding. In the second phase, the model parameters are fine-tuned for the task of erroneous data detection. The model applies a data augmentation module to generate more erroneous examples to represent the minority class. The experimental evaluation considers a wide range of databases with different types of errors and distributions. The empirical results show that our solution can enhance the recall values by 32.95% on average compared with state-of-the-art techniques while reducing the manual effort by up to 48.86%.  2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Due to the low data repair accuracy caused by one dimension measurement data transverse distribution of the traditional repair strategy, this paper fully considers the neighborhood data of the power system measurement data missing points and the periodic variation law of those data and puts forward a fuzzy self organizing map (FSOM) neural network based power quality measurement missing data repair method. Firstly, the one-dimensional measurement data of power quality are mapped into two-dimensional grayscale images to improve the time-space correlation analysis between the data. Then, the original data are clustered with artificial intelligence FSOM neural network algorithm to dissect their multi-layer characteristic values so that they can be given a hierarchical repair. Finally, FSOM algorithm performance is verified by the experiments of testing power quality data of LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley national laboratory).

Based on these data, game developers can build a range of data science applications, such as bot detection and social recommendation, to improve the gaming experience. However, the development of such applications requires data cleansing, training sample labeling, feature engineering, and model development, which makes the use of such applications in small and medium-sized game studios still uncommon. While acquiring supervised learning data is costly, unlabeled behavioral logs are often continuously and automatically generated in games. Thus we resort to unsupervised representation learning of player behavioral data to optimize intelligent services in games. Behavioral data has many unique properties, including semantic complexity, excessive length, etc. A worth noting property within raw player behavioral data is that a lot of it is task-irrelevant. For these data characteristics, we introduce a BPE-enhanced compression method and propose a novel adaptive masking strategy called Masking by Token Confidence (MTC) for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pre-training task. MTC is designed to increase the masking probabilities of task-relevant tokens.

TomoSAR is a powerful technique that allows the 3D reconstruction of objects lying on the Earth surface, by separating multiple scatterers with different elevations laying in the same range-azimuth resolution cell. In urban applications, the number of interfering scatterers is typically very small, so that the reconstruction of the elevation reflectivity profile can be faced as a statistical detection problem. Detection performance depends on how well the adopted statistical model fits to the observed scene. For complex urban scenarios this issue can greatly impair achievable accuracy of results. Then, we propose to exploit the neural networks' capabilities to learn the data generative model, in order to face the problem of signal model inaccuracies. In particular, in the assumption of a single scatterer, a neural network can be trained to solve a simple classification problem.

The fundamental idea is to treat the data points with label noise as outliers of the class indicated by the corresponding noisy label. This essentially allows us to deal with the traditional supervised problem of classification with label noise as an unsupervised one, i.e., identifying outliers from each class. However, finding such dubious observations (outliers) from each class is challenging in general. We therefore propose to reduce their potential influence using class-specific feature learning by autoencoder. Particularly, we learn for each class a feature space using all the samples labeled as that class, including those with noisy (but unknown to us) labels. Furthermore, in order to solve the situation when the noise is relatively high, we propose a weighted class-specific autoencoder by considering the effect of each data point on the postulated model. To fully exploit the advantage of the learned class-specific feature space, we use a minimum reconstruction error based method for finding out the outliers (label noise) and solving the classification task. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance on the task of data cleaning and classification with noisy labels.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:34","2022-07-31 04:31:42","","1845-1860","","2","50","","Neural Processing Letters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-018-9963-9","Cleaning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Statistics; Data cleaning; Classification; Outliers; Data cleaning, Outliers, Classification, Class-specific autoencoder, Label noise; Label noise; Class-specific autoencoder; MISCLASSIFICATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The distracted driving epidemic has long been under research to identify its impact on driving behavior. There have been a few attempts to detect drivers engagement in secondary tasks from observed driving behavior. Yet, to the authors knowledge, not much effort has been directed to identify the types of secondary tasks from driving behavior parameters. This study proposes a bi-level hierarchical classification methodology using machine learning to identify the different types of secondary tasks drivers are engaged in using their driving behavior parameters. At the first level, drivers engagement in secondary tasks is detected, while at the second level, the distinct types of secondary tasks are identified. Comparative evaluation is performed between nine ensemble tree classification methods to identify three types of secondary tasks (hand-held cellphone calling, cellphone texting, and interaction with an adjacent passenger). The inputs to the models are five driving behavior parameters (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, pedal position, and yaw rate) along with their standard deviations. The results showed that the overall secondary task detection accuracy ranged from 66% to 96%, except for the Decision Tree that was able to detect engagement in secondary tasks with a high accuracy of 99.8%. For the identification of secondary tasks types, the overall accuracy ranged from 55% to 79%, with the highest accuracy of 82.2% achieved by the Random Forest method. The findings of the paper show the proposed methodology promising to (1) characterize drivers engagement in unlawful secondary tasks (such as texting) as a counter measure to prevent crashes, and (2) alert drivers to pay attention back to the main driving task when risky changes to their driving behavior take place.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:34","2022-07-30 22:31:55","","274-281","","","123","","Accident Analysis and Prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2018.12.005","Machine learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Decision trees; Error detection; Behavioral research; Accidents; Identification (control systems); Telephone sets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent times, due to the innovation in vehicle propulsion, rolling noise also becomes a main factor in noise emission for lower order roads. Monitoring and labelling these roads, requires considerably more effort than monitoring primary roads and highways due to their large number. Therefore, we propose an opportunistic method where vehicles that are on the roads for other purposes, are used for rolling noise monitoring. The proposed method may also have some additional benefits over the standard CPX regarding the distribution of tires used and the spread of typical driving speeds. However, measurement conditions are not as well known and may influence the results obtained from individual vehicles significantly. The abundance of measurements data from many vehicles will nevertheless allow to eliminate any modifiers and confounders. To that end, a machine learning cleaning algorithm inspired by denoising auto-encoders has been designed and implemented. This cleaning algorithm improves the convergence of measurements, giving the same quality of measurements with a lower number of passages and cars on a road segment.

Next, two data sets have been established, containing 575 facial motor nerve conduction study reports and 233 auditory brainstem response reports, respectively.

The performance comparisons of accuracy and recall rate among different algorithms indicate that the random forest algorithm has the optimal performance over the other two in both data sets. Moreover, the comparisons have been carried out in the cases with and without deviation standardization for each algorithm, and the results demonstrate that the deviation standardization has a certain effect on the accuracy improvement. Additionally, it is found that the random forest algorithm can present the ranking of the features in order of importance. Consequently, the random forest is proven to be an optimal algorithm for computer-aided diagnosis systems.

This paper proposes a multitask learning algorithm for cell detection and segmentation using CNNs. We use dot annotations placed inside each cell indicating approximate cell centroids to create training datasets for the detection and segmentation tasks. The segmentation task is used to map the input image to foreground versus background regions, whereas the detection task is used to predict the centroids of the cells. Our multitask model shares convolutional layers between the two tasks, while having task-specific output layers. Learning two tasks simultaneously reduces the risks of overfitting and also helps in separating overlapping cells better. We also introduce a similarity interface (SI) that can be integrated with our multitask network to allow easy adaptation between domains, and to compensate for the variability in contrast and texture of cells seen in microscopy images. The SI comprises an unsupervised first layer in combination with a neighborhood similarity layer (NSL). A layer of logistic sigmoid functions is used as an unsupervised first layer to separate clustered image patches from each other. The NSL transforms its input feature map at a given pixel by computing its similarity to the surrounding neighborhood.

The FDI attacks aim to mislead the industrial platforms by falsifying their sensor measurements. FDI attacks have successfully overcome the classical threat detection approaches. In this article, we present a novel method of FDI attack detection using autoencoders (AEs). We exploit the sensor data correlation in time and space, which in turn can help identify the falsified data. Moreover, the falsified data are cleaned using the denoising AEs (DAEs). Performance evaluation proves the success of our technique in detecting FDI attacks. It also significantly outperforms a support vector machine (SVM)-based approach used for the same purpose.

Such process of information mining should be built on the basis of pre-processing, including data cleaning, aligning, segmentation and so on. In this paper, we mainly focus on an efficient algorithm to accurately segment time sequences in hydrology domain. Although traditional methods of time series segmentation can segment time series easily, there are three drawbacks in traditional methods; First, traditional segmentation methods pay more attention to the evaluation of the compression ratio and the fitting rate, but ignore the accuracy of segmentation points; Secondly, traditional segmentation methods do not take the information of time series data itself into account, such as it is easy to divide a whole time series into two time series segments, which leads to losing semantic information in time series analysis. Finally, in these traditional evaluations of time series segmentation, the number of segments and the position of the segmentation points are not comprehensively taken into account. In this paper, we propose a time series segmentation method based on Bi-LG-LSTM neural network, which is modified on the base of the LSTM/Bi-LSTM neural network. Through the supervised learning method on flood flow data sets, we can extract a large number of effective segments of the time series. Meanwhile, we propose a novel evaluation method, which utilizes the dynamic DTW distance method to evaluate the results of the time series segmentation method. The evaluation method takes the position of segmentation points and the number of time series segments into consideration. Experiments on the flood flow time series show that our proposed method has an obvious effect.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:35","2022-07-31 03:57:34","","162-169","","","","","","","2020 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics, ICCCBDA 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Chengdu, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCCBDA49378.2020.9095566","Long short-term memory; Big data; Cleaning; Data handling; Learning systems; Neural networks; Cloud computing; Feature extraction; Advanced Analytics; Data mining; Semantics; Time series analysis; Data compression ratio; Floods; Bi-LG-LSTM; flood flow time series; intelligent data processing; Logic gates; Microsoft Windows; segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many patients with malignant tumors still have recurrence and metastasis after effective treatment. Exploring the mechanism of tumor recurrence and metastasis to predict the recurrence and metastasis of cancer is a major clinical issue. At the same time, the rapid development of the Human Genome Project and gene microarray technology has enabled the activity of many genes in the patient's body to be intuitively measured through the chip. The rapid development of machine learning has contributed to the data mining and medical science of this DNA microarray technology. Therefore, this project aims at the above-mentioned problems and predicts the location and time of recurrence by analyzing a large amount of clinical data and 2enetic data. Firstly, we perform simple data cleaning and normalization processing on clinical data and genetic data; second, perform differential gene screening; next, select principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, nuclear principal component analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling algorithms to reduce the dimensional of the data. Finally, the genetic data uses random forest, support vector machine, linear support vector machine, guided aggregation algorithm, gradient boosting algorithm, and ensemble learning for machine learning, and then finds the best parameters and methods through grid search, and selects the appropriate model Evaluation method. The clinical data is manually selected and classified using machine learning. Finally, the results of clinical data and genetic data are combined to predict the site of recurrence. Using the above method to predict the recurrence and the location of the recurrence, a good effect was achieved. Taking whether to recurrence as an example, the accuracy rate of the verification set reached 0.825, the recall rate reached 0.801, the Fl score reached 0.800.

In traditional approaches, the local GHI can be measured with very expensive instruments, and the large-area GHI collection depends on complex satellite-based models, solargis algorithms, and the high-performance computers (HPC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to capture the GHI conveniently and accurately. Considering the nonstationary property of the GHI on cloudy days, the GHI capturing is cast as an image regression problem. In traditional approaches, the image regression problem is treated as two parts, feature extraction (for the images) and regression model (for the regression targets), which are optimized separately and blocked the interconnections. Considering the nonlinear regression capability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image regression approach is proposed to provide an End-to-End solution for the cloudy day GHI capturing problem in this paper. The multilayer CNN is based on the AlexNet and VGG. The L2 (least square errors) with regularization is used as the loss function in the regression layer. For data cleaning, the Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference is employed to detect and eliminate the anomaly data in a nonparametric manner. The purified data are used as input data for the proposed image regression approach. In the experiments, three-month sky images and GHI data (with 1-min resolution) are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the HPC system.

Using traditional machine learning algorithms in the modeling of power station boilers will require features selection and steady-state extraction, which is not suitable for practical applications. In order to reduce the NOx prediction error rate under variable operating conditions, a multi-model fusion algorithm S3LX combined with linear regression, XGBoost, and long-short-Term memory recurrent neural network is proposed to model the NOx emission prediction of power station boilers. The preprocessing data scheme suitable for power station boiler data sets is proposed and implemented in this paper, which can perform numerical processing, data cleaning and data standardization for boiler's data and features. A 7-day historical operating data set of a unit in Guangzhou Shajiao C Power Plant was used as the training set and test set and was used to build the NOx emission prediction model after data preprocessing. Results show that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, S3LX has good prediction ability under varying conditions with an average error of 4.28%.

Presently, the approaches being employed are logging surveys, the moving window method, the rapid inversion method, and the customized type curve method. However, these methods are not suitable for reservoirs with high levels of heterogeneity in terms of geology, and require more expert knowledge and field survey, which can be time consuming and costly. Therefore, the present method developed is an economic and fast approach to determine infill and replacement drilling location from reservoir ranking maps generated in combination with machine learning methods. During this project, production data and reservoir parameters were gathered from an old oil field with more than 2,500 wells where most of the field was under water injection. Bubble maps were created for each reservoir parameter for a better visual representation of reservoir conditions. Then, after data cleansing and normalization procedures, the standout attributes were identified from all given reservoir parameters and production history and a reservoir ranking rule was set. Next, five types of classification approaches were used for prediction. This paper additionally presents a regression method, artificial neural network (ANN), to compare with the prediction results from classification. For each machine learning technique, a reserve ranking map was generated for this test field to predict future infill drilling and replacement drilling opportunities. Thus, with only geographic coordinates, the reserve ranking level was obtained. From cross-fold validation results, a quadratic support vector machine provides the highest prediction accuracy. From a practical standpoint, a decision tree offers a more realistic result. In addition to the ANN method outputs, the ranking result provides a smooth method between certain levels. This new approach of using artificial intelligence was used to provide the ranking level and ranking number to identify the best options for drilling the wells, which is different from the present traditional methods. This advanced reservoir ranking map allows operators to identify the best location for infill or replacement drilling. It can additionally help operators benefit from their previously gathered knowledge in a cost-effective way.

Currently, data cleaning is mainly done manually, which is time-consuming. The existing methods for automatically relabeling OARs remain unpractical with real patient data, due to the inconsistent delineation and similar small-volume OARs. This paper proposes an improved data augmentation technique according to the characteristics of clinical data. Besides, a novel 3D non-local convolutional neural network is proposed, which includes a decision making network with voting strategy. The resulting model can automatically identify OARs and solve the problems in existing methods, achieving the accurate OAR re-labeling goal. We used partial data from a public head-and-neck dataset (HN_PETCT) for training, and then tested the model on datasets from three different medical institutions. We have obtained the state-of-the-art results for identifying 28 OARs in the head-and-neck region, and also our model is capable of handling multi-center datasets indicating strong generalization ability.

"2QDG3YB8","journalArticle","2019","Bahrami, Sepideh","Global Ensemble Streamflow and Flood Modeling with Application of Large Data Analytics, Deep learning and GIS","","","","","","Flooding is one of the most dangerous natural disasters that repeatedly occur globally, and flooding frequently leads to major urban, financial, anthropogenic, and environmental impacts in the subjected area. Therefore, developing flood susceptibility maps to identify flood zones in the catchment is necessary for improved flood management and decision making. Streamflow and flood forecasting can provide important information for various applications including optimization of water resource allocations, water quality assessment, cost analysis, sustainable design of hydrological infrastructures, improvement in agriculture and irrigation practices. Compared to conventional or physically based hydrological modeling, which needs a large amount of historical data and parameters, the recent data-driven models which require limited amounts of data, have received growing attention among researchers due to their high predictive performance. This makes them more appropriate for hydrological forecasting in basin-scale and data-scarce regions. In this context, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of various data-driven modeling approaches in flood and streamflow forecasting. One of the significant desires in daily streamflow prediction in todayaEs world is recognizing possible indicators and improving their applicability for effective water management strategies. In this context, the authors proposed an ensemble data mining algorithm coupled with various machine learning methods to perform data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, and feature subset selection. To perform the task of data mining, three data cleaning approaches: Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Tensor Flow (TF) and Tensor Flow K-means clustering(TF-k-means clustering) have been used. For the feature selection, four different machine learning approaches including K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap aggregating, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machin (SVM) have been investigated. Out of twelve different combinations of data mining and machine learning, the best ensemble model was TF-k-means clustering coupled with RF, which outperformed the other methods with 96.52% classification accuracy.Thereafter, a modified Nonlinear Echo State Networks Multivariate Polynomial (NESN-MP) named in the current study as Robust Nonlinear Echo State Network (RNESN) was utilized for daily streamflow forecasting. The RNESN decreases the size of the reservoir (hidden layer which performs random weigh initialization), reduces the computational burden compared with NESN-MP, and increases the interactions between the internal states. The model is thus simple and user-friendly with better learning ability and more accurate forecasting performance. The method has been tested with data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center (NOAA) and Daymet Data Set from NASA through the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS). Each data set includes the daily records of the local observed hydrological and large-scale weather/climate variability parameters. The efficiency of the proposed method has been evaluated in three regions namely Berkshire County (MA), Tuolumne County (CA), and Wasco County (OR). These basins were designated based upon the wide range of climatic conditions across the US that they represent. The simulation results were compared with NESN-MP and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The results validate the superiority of the proposed modeling approach compared to NESN-MP and ANFIS. The proposed RNESN approaches outperform the other methods with an RMSE = 0.98.For flood forecasting, an Evidential Belief Function (EBF) model, both as an individual model and in combination with Logistic Regression (LR) methods, has been proposed to prepare the flood susceptibility map. In in this study, we proposed a new ensemble of models of Bootstrap aggregating as a Meta classifier based upon the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) functions including coarse, cosine, cubic and weighted as base classifiers to perform spatial prediction of the flood. We first selected 10 conditioning factors to spatial prediction of floods and then their prediction capability using the relief-F attribute evaluation (RFAE) method was assessed. Model validation was performed using two statistical error-indexes and the area under the curve (AUC). Results concluded that the Bootstrap aggregating -cubic KNN ensemble model outperformed the other ensemble models. Therefore, the Bootstrap aggregating -cubic KNN model can be used as a promising technique for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas. Furthermore, the AUC results indicated that the EBF, EBF from LR, EBF-LR (enter), and EBF-LR (stepwise) success rates were 94.61%, 67.94%, 86.45%, and 56.31%, respectively, and the prediction rates were 94.55%, 66.41%, 83.19%, and 52.98%. The results showed that the EBF model had the highest accuracy in predicting the flood susceptibility map, in which 14% of the total areas were located in high and very high susceptibility classes and 62% were located in low and very low susceptibility classes.

As artificial intelligence continues to develop, data-driven machine learning method can establish a robust model based on massive data to clarify development risks and challenges, predict development dynamic characteristics in advance. This study gathers over 15 years actual data from targeted carbonate reservoir and establishes a robust Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network prediction model based on correlation analysis, data cleaning, feature variables selection, hyper-parameters optimization and model evaluation to forecast oil production, gas-oil ratio (GOR), and water cut (WC) of WAG flooding. In comparison to traditional reservoir numerical simulation (RNS), LSTM neural networks have a huge advantage in terms of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The calculation time of LSTM method is 864% less than reservoir numerical simulation method, while prediction error of LSTM method is 261% less than RNS method. We classify producers into three types based on the prediction results and propose optimization measures aimed at the risks and challenges they faced. Field implementation indicates promising outcome with better reservoir support, lower GOR, lower WC, and stabler oil production.

To fairly compare the repair performance of different signals, the mean squared error, relative peak-to-peak average error, and relative peak-to-peak max error are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the repair results of different signals.

As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learningbased data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.

The optimum utilization of health resources saves money and time, but above all, it saves precious lives. It has become even more evident in the present as the pandemic has overstretched the existing medical resources. Specific to patient appointment scheduling, the casual attitude of missing medical appointments (no-show-ups) may cause severe damage to a patient's health. In this paper, with the help of machine learning, we analyze six million plus patient appointment records to predict a patient's behaviors/characteristics by using ten different machine learning algorithms. For this purpose, we first extracted meaningful features from raw data using data cleaning. We applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method (Adasyn), and random undersampling (RUS) to balance our data. After balancing, we applied ten different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest classifier, decision tree, logistic regression, XG Boost, gradient boosting, Adaboost Classifier, Naive Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, multilayer perceptron, and Support Vector Machine. We analyzed these results with the help of six different metrics, i.e., recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, area under the curve, and mean square error. Our study has achieved 94% recall, 86% accuracy, 83% precision, 87% F1-score, 92% area under the curve, and 0.106 minimum mean square error. Effectiveness of presented data cleaning and feature selection is confirmed by better results in all training algorithms. Notably, recall is greater than 75%, accuracy is greater than 73%, F1-score is more significant than 75%, MSE is lesser than 0.26, and AUC is greater than 74%.

Power loss analysis is efficient for the monitoring of large power plants and for developing an optimal cleaning schedule, but it is not adapted for remote monitoring of standalone photovoltaic systems that are used in rural and poor regions. Indeed, this technique relies on a costly and dirt sensitive irradiance sensor. This paper investigates the possibility of a low-cost monitoring of cleaning interventions on photovoltaic modules during daytime. We believe that it can be helpful to know whether the soiling is regularly removed or not, and to decide if it is necessary to carry out additional cleaning operations. The problem is formulated as a classification task to automatically identify the occurrence of a cleaning intervention using a time window of temperature, voltage and current measurements of a photovoltaic array. We investigate machine learning tools based on Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest to achieve such classification task. In addition, we study the influence of the temporal resolution of the signals and the feature extraction on the classification performance. The experiments are conducted on a real dataset and show promising results with classification accuracy of up to 95%. Based on the results, three implementation strategies addressing different practical needs are proposed.

The methods used in the research were data cleaning to get rid of the noisy data, manual fill-in for the missing values, aggregation for data transformation, attribute subset selection in data reduction and finally creating a class label to determine the quality of each call and prepare the preprocessed data for supervised learning. The experimental results proved the efficiency of the proposed method and solved a great challenge that is facing telecom operators by saving operational costs and time.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:38","2022-07-30 22:43:00","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of: 2020 International Conference on Computer, Control, Electrical, and Electronics Engineering, ICCCEEE 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Khartoum, Sudan","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCCEEE49695.2021.9429667","Learning systems; Decision making; Telecommunication industry; Supervised learning; Metadata; Quality of service; Data preprocessing; Manuals; Telecommunications; Automated Carrier Selection; Digital control; Routing; Voice Calls Routing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes two novel approaches for taxi demand prediction that is about to come in the next ten-minutes interval. The first model is a three-stage ensemble model for prediction where the first stage consists of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and then Mini-Batch K-Means clustering is applied, followed by time-binning in the second stage and in the final stage the processed data is fed to the Ensemble Model. The second model is a four-stage deep learning model where the first two stages are common as the proposed ensemble model. In the third stage, the Fourier Transform of the time series data is used to extract and add more features to the training set and in the final stage, the processed training set is fed to the deep neural network (DNN) for prediction.

Globally, a significant amount of energy is consumed in residential buildings, i.e., 30-40% of total energy consumption. An active energy prediction system is highly desirable for efficient energy production and utilization. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to predict short-term energy consumption in a residential building. The proposed methodology consisted of four different layers, namely data acquisition, preprocessing, prediction, and performance evaluation. For experimental analysis, real data collected from 4 multi-storied buildings situated in Seoul, South Korea, has been used. The collected data is provided as input to the data acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer afterwards, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes are applied to the input data for the removal of abnormalities. Preprocessing further consisted of two processes, namely the computation of statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) and data normalization. In the prediction layer, the feed forward back propagation neural network has been used on normalized data and data with statistical moments. In the performance evaluation layer, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) have been used to measure the performance of the proposed approach. The average values for data with statistical moments of MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are 4.3266, 11.9617, and 5.4625 respectively. These values of the statistical measures for data with statistical moments are less as compared to simple data and normalized data which indicates that the performance of the feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBPNN) on data with statistical moments is better when compared to simple data and normalized data.","2019-06","2022-06-10 02:10:38","2022-07-30 22:29:06","","30 (16 pp.)","","2","7","","Technologies","","Technologies (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies7020030","power engineering computing; statistical analysis; mean square error methods; data acquisition; energy consumption; backpropagation; buildings (structures); feedforward neural nets; artificial neural network; ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; energy consumption prediction; smart buildings; smart homes; statistical moments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today, there is technology to look at the problem from a unique perspective. A novel look at the problem focuses on evaluation of machine learning algorithms to predict downhole vibrations. Prediction is the first step in a longer road map. The goal would be to find an optimal combination of revolutions per minute (RPM) and weight-on-bit (WOB) to remedy drilling vibration in real-time, hence closing the loop. Drilling mechanics data for thousands of wells, acquired over more than ten years was analyzed. Some preparation of the drilling mechanics data was required. Data cleaning was first performed. This included corrections for time-dependent nature of the data. Data imputing for missing values and handling of outliers and anomalies was also performed in this stage. This was followed by feature engineering which included adding variables based on company-wide drilling domain expertise. Variables to capture data patterns and variables for better capturing the time-series dependencies were also created in this stage. This paper will discuss methodologies and general rules that were tested for preparing unstructured drilling data. A few of the machine learning algorithms used as building blocks of our full solution are gradient boosting and random forest. Deep learning models were also tested and the value of these are compared. The results were compiled to decide the best algorithm which could further be used to fine-tune optimum performance. The time series aspect of the data is captured in a moving window. As the window increases, the performance of each algorithm also varied. Also, evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of each algorithm for the drilling predictions is detailed. Ways to improve the accuracy of prediction for downhole vibrations is also suggested with reference to the results showing the logic behind all recommendations. There will be a summary of the details of each finding and a short discussion on the way forward for the industry.  2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:38","2022-07-31 05:26:32","","","","","","","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2019, ADIP 2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/197584-ms","Deep learning; Learning systems; Decision trees; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Time series; Infill drilling; Adaptive boosting; Gasoline; Slip forming; Stick-slip","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, data conditioning involves outlier detection, missingdata, data imputation, and smoothing. Time-series production data prediction can be challenging becausethe target (wellbore oil production) depends on large-scale, high-dimensional data sets with unknowndistributions and is influenced by missing data and outliers. Hence, data conditioning is key for accuratepredictions. The current work is the first attempt at using ensemble ML and statistical techniques, such asmultilayer perceptron (MLP), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector regression (SVR),for well pad data conditioning using recently disclosed subsurface and production data from a field inthe southern area of the Norwegian North Sea. The time-series forecasting based on large-scale, high-dimensional conditioned and cleaned data sets is also presented. The data with an oil production rate greater than 10 Sm3 have been retained for data cleansing, whichreduced the size of the production well data set by 14.9%. Outliers are detected using the z-score method.The missing values are predicted using a trained ML model on all available nonmissing data. The procedurefirst predicts the downhole missing values from all the wells, including the available neighboring wells, andthen uses these features to predict other missing values for the well pad. In this paper, the two approachesimplemented and compared for prediction of missing data are MLP and SVR, and PCA is performed toextract the most important data features. Production data with 12 related variables (i.e., dates, hours, temperature, pressure, etc.) are used to explorethe complex nonlinearity of features and estimate wellbore oil production with ML and deep-learningmodels. Conventional SVR and MLP methods are implemented as the benchmark. During this work, more than 60% of the missing and abnormal data from the field data set are detectedand imputed using advanced ML methods, such as MLP and SVR with radial basis function kernel. Morethan 6% of data are outliers and are removed using the z-score method. The modified SVR with time-seriesdata structure and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms are used for the comparisons. An R-squared(R2) of 98% is achieved for both the algorithms; however, LSTM has the lowest root mean square error(RMSE) results compared to SVR. Data conditioning is conventionally performed using statistical techniques, but here, an ensemble of MLtechniques is used depending on the available data. This paper presents a new methodology to performdata conditioning and production prediction for a well pad using ML and neighboring well data. The MLalgorithms used are highly efficient, as demonstrated by the results.  2020, Offshore Technology Conference.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:38","2022-07-31 14:31:49","","","","","2020-May","","","","Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference","","","","Offshore Technology Conference","Houston, TX, United states","","","","","","","","","","","","Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Forecasting; Clustering algorithms; Mean square error; Time series; Petroleum industry; Support vector regression; Boreholes; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore technology; Oil field equipment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High frequency time series data (typically one data point per second) from multiple sensors on a drilling rig is processed and labeled with drilling states including: slide drilling, rotate drilling, pick up, in slips, and others. With labeled time-series data, the real-time system can derive operational KPIs (key performance indicators) with extremely high resolution, e.g., a statistical summary of rotary versus slide drilling time for the rig supervisor and drilling engineer to analyze efficiency. Later, such information can be leveraged to develop algorithms to detect abnormal drilling events and drive closed loop control. A workflow was developed to clean and fill in any missing data. A rules-based model was then applied to classify the data into seventeen rig states. For the state ""drilling"", a sub-classification was made to label rotate drilling and slide drilling. However, it is difficult to categorize ""slide drilling"" solely based on surface RPM due to top drive oscillation. In order to achieve acceptable accuracies, three machine learning models to classify ""rotate drilling"" and ""slide drilling"" were evaluated: Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network / Recurrent Neural Network (CNN/RNN). Machine learning models were built for two basins, one model each, to accommodate different drilling styles. For the Delaware Basin, 10 wells with 9 million rows of data were chosen, and for the DJ Basin, 12 wells with 2 million rows of data were chosen. A legacy, rules-based algorithm was applied to label each row as rotate or slide drilling, and the misclassified records were manually corrected. The machine learning models were found to be far superior to rules-based models. For the wells in the training set, the accuracies of our rules-based models were 70% and 90% respectively, while the accuracies of our machine learning models were over 99%. The CNN model was proven to be the best model, excelling with high accuracy, short computation time, and scalability for big data applications. The data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning algorithm has been deployed in Anadarko's Real-Time Drilling (RTD) ecosystem (Cao et al., 2018, 2019), which consists of four layers: a data source, analytics, data storage, and UI layer. KPIs, directional statistics, and engineering models are calculated in real-time and visualized through a web-based UI. This system can be accessed by any member of the drilling operations team. The system is regularly used to evaluate, compare, and optimize well performance. Future plans include pushing analytical models to the rig site with edge computing to facilitate drilling guidance and levels of automation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning model has been used to analyze drilling time series data in a production real-time system.  2019, Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC)","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:39","2022-07-31 15:37:15","","","","","","","","","SPE/AAPG/SEG Unconventional Resources Technology Conference 2020, URTeC 2020","","","","Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTEC)","Virtual, Online","","","","","","","","","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.15530/urtec-2019-253; http://dx.doi.org/10.15530/urtec-2019-253","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Decision trees; Digital storage; Benchmarking; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Time series; Infill drilling; Closed loop control systems; Interactive computer systems; Magnetic storage; Optical variables measurement; Personnel training; Real time systems; Resource valuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Thailand, many public agencies collect rainfall values, including National Hydro Informatics (HII), Thai Meteorological Department, etc., since the data are valuable in terms of rainfall prediction, which is important for an agricultural country like Thailand. The rainfall data is normally collected hourly, and because there are many sensor locations, it is hard to maintain these sensors. The sensor data can be lost transiently and/or may yield anomaly values. Since there is a lot of data flowing to the server every day, it is hard to inspect manually or even semi-manually. This project collaborates with HII to develop a system that automates the rainfall data quality improvement process. The machine learning algorithms are used as tools for data cleansing. The derived data can be exposed as an open data set for many developers to explore new innovations. We explore data set characteristics and adopt both statistical and machine learning methods.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based QoE prediction approach with a large-scale QoE dataset for mobile video transmission. Specifically, we develop a mobile phone application for collecting user QoE data when viewing videos transmitted over the mobile internet in a practical environment. Then, we construct a large-scale dataset by collecting over 80000 piece of data with four kinds of subjective scores and 89 network parameters. Each QoE metric is related to only some of the 89 network parameters. Therefore, we apply the feature selection method to find the feature parameters related to user scores. Additionally, the boxplot method is used to clean the raw data by removing outliers. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to learn the relationships between the network parameters and the subjective QoE scores. The proposed DNN can also be seen as a data-driven objective QoE prediction approach for mobile video transmission, which can be used to predict the user QoE scores. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively remove most features irrelevant to QoE prediction. Moreover, the performance of QoE prediction by the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.  1983-2012 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:39","2022-07-31 05:41:25","","1337-1348","","6","37","","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904359","Monitoring; Deep learning; Neural networks; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Data acquisition; feature selection; User experience; Quality of service; data cleaning; deep learning; Databases; Streaming media; Quality assessment; Image communication systems; MODEL; data collection; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; Quality of experience; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; SERVICE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given this importance, however, monitoring of production rates is not usually carried out in real time. Some cases flowmeters are used which are known to carry their own inherent uncertainties. The industry, thus, relies on the use of correlations to allocate production to wells. Over time, it has been realized that the generally used correlations are not effective enough due to multiple technical and economic issues. The focus of this work is to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a correlation that can accurately predict oil rate in artificial gas lift wells. The reason for using these algorithms is to provide a solution that is simple, easy to use and universally applicable. Various intelligent algorithms are employed, namely; Artificial Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), along with the development of Artificial Neural Network providing a usable equation to be applied on any field, hence demystifying the black-box reputation of artificial intelligence. In addition, non-linear regression is also performed to compare the results with ML methods. Data cleansing and data-reduction were carried out on the dataset comprising of 1500 separator test points. This practice yielded in only the common wellhead parameters to be used as input for the model. All ML models were compared with the non-linear regression model and with previously derived empirical models to gauge the effectiveness of the work. The newly developed model using ANN shows that it can predict the flow-rate with 99% accuracy. This is an interesting outcome, as such accuracy has not been reported in literature usually. The results of this study show that the correlation developed using ANN outperforms all the current empirical correlations, moreover, it also performs multiple times better in comparison to previously developed AI models. In addition, this work provides a functional equation that can be used by anyone on their field data, thereby removing any ambiguities or confusion related to the concept of artificial intelligence expertise and software. This effort puts forth an industrial insight into the role of data-driven computational models for the production reconnaissance scheme, not only to validate the well tests but also as an effective tool to reduce qualms in production provisions.  2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:39","2022-07-31 05:32:20","","","","","2019-March","","","","SPE Middle East Oil and Gas Show and Conference, MEOS, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/194713-ms","Learning systems; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Statistical tests; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Computer aided instruction; Gas lifts; Oil wells; Well testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, traditional gas kick detection methods in such environments have significant time-lag and can often lead to severe well control issues, and occasionally to well blowouts or borehole abandonment. In this study, firstly, the raw field data is processed through data collection, data cleaning, feature scaling, outlier detection, data labeling and dataset splitting. Additionally, a novel data labeling criterion for gas kick risks is proposed where five kick risks (Indicated by different colors in this study) are defined based on three key indicators: differential flow out (DFO), kick gain volume (Vol), and kick duration time (Time). Kick risk status represents one of the following cases: Case 0 - No indicators are activated (Green), Case 1 - Multi-drilling parameters deviation or DFO is activated (Orange), Case 2 - DFO and Vol are simultaneously activated (Light Red), Case 3 - DFO and Time are simultaneously activated (Light Red), Case 4 - DFO, Vol and Time alarms are simultaneously activated (Dark Red). Then, a novel data mining method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is presented for early detection of gas kick events by analyzing time series data from field drilling process. The network parameters such as number of hidden layers and number of neurons are initialized to build the LSTM network. The learned LSTM model is evaluated using the testing set, and the best LSTM model (six (6)-layers eighty (80)-nodes (6 L*80 N)) is optimally selected and deployed. The accuracy of deployed LSTM model is 87 % in the testing dataset, which is reliable enough to identify the kick fault during the deep-water drilling field operation. Lastly, the LSTM model detected the gas kick events earlier than the ""Tank Volume"" detection method in several representative case studies to conclude that the application of LSTM model can potentially improve well control safety in the deep-water wells with narrow MW windows.  2020","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:40","2022-07-31 13:42:43","","312-328","","","146","","Process Safety and Environmental Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institution of Chemical Engineers","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2020.08.012","Long short-term memory; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Statistical tests; Data mining; Data acquisition; Supervised learning; Risk assessment; Infill drilling; Gases; Deepwater drilling; Chemical detection; Offshore oil well production; Abandoned wells; Accident prevention; Offshore gas wells; Risk analysis; Water wells; Early gas; Field data analysis; Gas kick; Industrial deep-water drilling; Kick detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Training of the models was performed using image data available on the Internet, while database development included data cleansing by expert agronomists, basic image editing, and data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning applications in order to expand the rather limited amount of available data. Three fungi diseases, two pests and three nutrient deficiencies were included in the identification system, together with healthy plants identification. The final model reached a performance of 90.79% in successfully identifying cannabis diseases (or healthy plants) in previously ""unseen"" plant images. The most difficult cannabis problems to be identified were powdery mildew and potassium deficiency. Results showed that transfer learning from existing models specialized in similar tasks to the one under development, is more successful than using transfer learning from more general models. Finally, even though the amount of training images in some of the considered problems was significantly small, no correlation between model performance and the size of the training dataset for each category was found.

However, data cleansing is often a laborious task that requires intuition or expert knowledge. In particular, selecting an outlier detection algorithm is challenging as this choice is dataset-specific and depends on the nature of the considered dataset. These difficulties have prevented the development of a ""one-fits-all"" approach for the cleansing of real-world, noisy datasets. Here, we present an unsupervised, ensemble-based outlier detection (EBOD) approach that considers the union of different outlier detection algorithms, wherein each of the selected detectors is only responsible for identifying a small number of outliers that are the most obvious from their respective standpoints. The use of an ensemble of weak detectors reduces the risk of bias during outlier detection as compared to using a single detector. The optimal combination of detectors is determined by forwardbackward search. By taking the example of a noisy dataset of concrete strength measurements as well as a broad collection of benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our EBOD method systematically outperforms all alternative detectors, when used individually or in combination. Based on this new outlier detection method, we explore how data cleansing affects the complexity, training, and accuracy of an artificial neural network.  2021 The Authors","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:40","2022-07-31 03:21:41","","","","","231","","Knowledge-Based Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107400","Anomaly detection; Data handling; Machine learning; Neural networks; Statistics; Signal detection; Concretes; Concrete strength; Data cleansing; Outlier detection; Concrete strength, Machine learning, Outlier detection, Data cleansing; CONCRETE; MACHINE; NETWORKS; RATIO; STRENGTH; SUPPORT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is able to determine stress, fatigue, workload, health status and pilot capacity with new models based on DCNN encoded in Python which are able to interpret these vital data.Additionally, PMS is able to launch alerts when the vital parameters of the crew reach pre-established limits, giving the chance to detect an abnormal situation (e.g. excessive workload scenario with high stress level). In this way, it will improve situational awareness by making crew aware of their own conditionGoing deeper into the details of the Stress Model, its main objective is to determine Pilot stress in real time.For achieving this target, several design stages were taken into consideration while building the Stress Model DCNN: raw data acquisition, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training, model evaluation, model testing, and result analysis. Further details of these stages are explained below.Regarding data acquisition, Stress Model obtains pilot's vital data from a smartwatch (one of the wearable devices of PMS), which communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a laptop. Selected device was Analog Devices Inc. Gen II watch, which sends the following signals: Heart Rate (HR), Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA), Skin temperature and 3D Acceleration.At Cleaning stage, Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) was used to normalize our raw data, being less sensitive to outliers and therefore more robust.At Feature engineering stage, several signal combinations were explored. The selected signal set which gave the best Stress Model accuracy was comprised of two EDA parameters (Real Admittance [Siemens], Impedance Magnitude [Ohm]) and wrist Skin Temperature [deg C].At Algorithm selection stage, three convolutional layers (128, 256 and 128 filters respectively) were chosen to extract a feature map from the inputs. After them, a Global Average Pooling (GAP) was chosen to compress the convolutions output. Downstream GAP, a decision layer based on softmax activation function (stress vs non-stress) was chosen.At Training stage, it was necessary to implement a Stress Test recording campaign. Participants were asked to fulfill several individual demanding tasks (memory, multi-task, stroop, vigilance) which included relaxing periods among them. The Stress Model was fed with the vital data obtained in this campaign.In between the tasks, NASA-TLX questionnaires were filled by test subjects, to obtain their subjective rating of Mental demand, Physical demand, Temporal demand, Performance, Effort and Frustration. Therefore, the Stress Model considered both vital data and self-report questionnaires as inputs.At result analysis stage, the Stress Model accuracy was refined, understanding accuracy as the ratio between correct predicted stress scenarios versus total cases, and considering ground truth self-report questionnaires.Finally, Stress Model DCNN was validated considering three data sources, whose details are included below:A.Vital data from fifteen (N=15) subjects of Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) Database available online.Stress Model gave an average test accuracy of 99%,B.Vital data from four (N=4) Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) pilots while calibrating their NASA-TLX scale.Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 90%.C.Vital data from six (N=6) ADS pilots while performing simulator evaluations using an Enhanced Light Weight Visor (ELWEV).Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 87%.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 14:15:41","","AESS; AIAA; AIAA Digital Avionics Technical Committee (DATC); et al.; IEEE; Southwest Research Institute (SWRI)","","","2021-October","","","","AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","San Antonio, TX, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594363","Monitoring; Deep neural networks; Data acquisition; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; NASA; Wearable computers; Analytical models; Training; Data models; Predictive models; Atmospheric modeling; Temperature sensors; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Electro-Dermal Activity; NASA-TLX; Pilot Stress; wearable devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is difficult to provide accurate local wear predictions in a timely manner. Data-driven approaches provide a more computationally efficient way to approximate the CFD wear predictions without running the actual CFD wear models. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach, termed WearGP, is presented to approximate the 3D local wear predictions, using numerical wear predictions from steady-state CFD simulations as training and testing datasets. The proposed framework is built on Gaussian process (GP) and utilized to predict wear in a much shorter time. The WearGP framework can be segmented into three stages. At the first stage, the training dataset is built by using a number of CFD simulations in the order of O(102). At the second stage, the data cleansing and data mining processes are performed, where the nodal wear solutions are extracted from the solution database to build a training dataset. At the third stage, the wear predictions are made, using trained GP models. Two CFD case studies including 3D slurry pump impeller and casing are used to demonstrate the WearGP framework, in which 144 training and 40 testing data points are used to train and test the proposed method, respectively. The numerical accuracy, computational efficiency and effectiveness between the WearGP framework and CFD wear model for both slurry pump impellers and casings are compared. It is shown that the WearGP framework can achieve highly accurate results that are comparable with the CFD results, with a relatively small size training dataset, with a computational time reduction on the order of 105 to 106.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 03:36:59","","9-26","","","422-423","","Wear","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2018.12.081","Machine learning; Learning systems; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Data mining; Computational efficiency; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Computational fluid dynamics; Impellers; Pumps; Slurry pipelines; Wear of materials; Gaussian process; Multiphase computational fluid dynamics; Slurry pump; Wear; MODEL; PARTICLE EROSION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has a better ability to organize, manage, and understand massive amounts of information, and can structure heterogeneous knowledge in the field. It can be widely used in medical, biological, financial, etc. In view of the current situation in the field of crop diseases and insect pests, there are multiple relationship pairs between the same entity and multiple entities, multi-source heterogeneous data, poor aggregation ability, low utilization, and the possibility of knowledge sharing. Combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining technologies, this study focused on data acquisition, ontology construction, knowledge extraction, and knowledge storage, researched on the construction of crops diseases and insect pests knowledge graph based on deep learning. Firstly, this study used the Scrapy crawler framework of the Python programming language to crawl data from web pages related to crop diseases and insect pests, and performed data cleaning and data supplementation through data preprocessing methods. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the domain corpus, the Protege ontology construction tool was used to complete the semi-automatic construction of the crop diseases and insect pests ontology predefined the set of properties and relations and set the corresponding domains and ranges. Then, based on the ontology, the rule method was used to extract semi-structured knowledge, and the deep learning method was used to extract unstructured knowledge. In the process of unstructured knowledge extraction, a text annotation mode ""Main_Entity+Relation+BIESO"" (ME+R+BIESO) adapted to the domain corpus was also proposed. Based on a predefined set of relationships, entities and relationships were simultaneously annotated, it contained entity and relationship information at the same time, and directly modeling the triples instead of separately modeling entities and relationships. The corresponding triples were also directly obtained through analysis, which not only saved at least half of the cost of labeling but also realized the joint extraction of entity relations and solved the problem of overlapping relation extraction. And this study used the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)- Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)+ Conditional Random Field (CRF) end-to-end model to experiment on the crop diseases and insect pests dataset. First, this study used the BERT pre-training language model to encode words, extracted text features, and used the generated vector as the input of the BiLSTM layer; BiLSTM integrated contextual information into the model at the same time, and performed bidirectional encoding to achieve effective prediction of label sequences; finally, this study used the CRF module to decode the output result of BiLSTM, and the label transition probability and constraint conditions were obtained through training and learning, and the entity label category of each character was obtained. The experimental results showed that the precision was 94.06%, the recall was 89.02%, and the F1 value reached 91.34%, which was much better than the pipeline method and classic models such as BiLSTM+CRF and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)+BiLSTM+CRF in the joint extraction method. The joint extraction of entity relations based on this annotation mode not only improved the efficiency and accuracy of annotation but also solved the problem of overlapping relations in the corpus. Finally, the extracted knowledge was stored in the graph database to realize the visual display of the knowledge graph and deep knowledge mining and reasoning.

Typically, silt (32128m) and sand (1281000m) sized grains will be characterized under an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope. In both cases, it is a tedious and costly process. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an original computational approach in order to automate mineral grains recognition from numerical images obtained with a simple optical microscope. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the current computer vision based on machine learning algorithms is tested for the automated recognition of such mineral grains. In more details, this work uses the simple linear iterative clustering segmentation to generate superpixels and many of them allow isolating sand grains, which is not possible with classical segmentation methods. Also, the approach has been tested using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs did not give as good results as the superpixels method. The superpixels are also exploited to extract features related to a sand grain. These image characteristics form the raw dataset. Prior to proceed with the classification, a data cleaning stage is necessary to get a usable dataset for machine learning algorithms. In addition, we present a comparison of performances of several algorithms. The overall obtained results are approximately 90% and demonstrate the concept of mineral recognition from a sample of sand grains provided by a numerical image.  2019 The Authors","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 03:08:49","","84-93","","","130","","Computers and Geosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2019.05.009","Machine learning; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Iterative methods; Convolutional neural networks; Computer vision; Classification; Image segmentation; Image processing; Microscopes; Mineral exploration; Optical data processing; Ores; Sand; Scanning electron microscopy; Superpixels; Sand grain, Features, Machine learning, Recognition, Classification, Segmentation, Image processing, Ore; Features; Ore; Recognition; Sand grain; Segmentation; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is most prevalent in the supply chain optimization sector where vast amount of documents need to be processed and is time consuming and prone to error. Detection of tables and table structures serves as a crucial step to automate document processing. While table detection is a well investigated problem, tabular structure detection is more complex, and requires further improvements. To address this, this study proposes a deep learning model that focuses on high precision tabular cell structure detection. The proposed model creates a benchmark for the ICDAR2013 dataset cell structure with comparison to the previous state of the art table detection models as well as proposing alternative models. Our methodology approaches improving table structure detection through the detection of cells instead of row and columns for better generalization capabilities for heterogeneous table structures. Our proposed model advances prior models by improving major parts of the detection pipeline, mainly the two-stage detector, backbone, backbone architecture, and non-maximum-suppression (NMS).

Although some models have been developed to predict linear or conformational B-cell epitopes, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Hundreds of thousands of linear B-cell epitope data have accumulated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). These data can be explored using the deep learning methods, in order to create better predictive models for linear B-cell epitopes. Results: After data cleaning, we obtained 240,563 peptide samples with experimental evidence from the IEDB database, including 25,884 linear B-cell epitopes and 214,679 non-epitopes. Based on the peptide center, we adapted each peptide to the same length by trimming or extending. A random portion of the data, with the same amount of epitopes and non-epitopes, were set aside as test dataset. Then a same number of epitopes and non-epitopes were randomly selected from the remaining data to build a classifier with the feedforward deep neural network. We built eleven classifiers to form an ensemble prediction model. The model will report a peptide as an epitope if it was classified as epitope by all eleven classifiers. Then we used the test data set to evaluate the performance of the model using the area value under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as an indicator. We established 40 models to predict linear B-cell epitopes of length from 11 to 50 separately, and found that the AUC value increased with the length and tended to be stable when the length was 38. Repeated results showed that the models constructed by this method were robust. Tested on our and two public test datasets, our models outperformed current major models available. Conclusions: We applied the feedforward deep neural network to the large amount of linear B-cell epitope data with experimental evidence in the IEDB database, and constructed ensemble prediction models with better performance than the current major models available.

Prediction of electrical loads and scheduling the generation resources to match the demand enable the utility to mitigate the energy generation cost. Different methodologies have been employed to predict energy consumption at different levels of distribution and transmission systems. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict energy consumption in smart buildings. The proposed framework consists of two stages, namely, data cleaning, and model building. The data cleaning phase applies pre-processing techniques to the raw data and adds additional features of lag values. In the model-building phase, the hybrid model is trained on the processed data. The hybrid deep learning (DL) model is based on the stacking of fully connected layers, and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) on bi-directional LSTMs. The proposed model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies of energy consumption on dependent features and to be effective in terms of computational complexity, training time, and forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark energy consumption datasets yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy when compared with widely used hybrid models such as Convolutional (Conv) Neural Network-LSTM, ConvLSTM, LSTM encoder-decoder model, stacking models, etc. A mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.00% for case study 1 and a MAPE of 3.71% for case study 2 is obtained for the proposed forecasting DL model in comparison with LSTM-based models that yielded 7.80% MAPE and 5.099% MAPE for two datasets respectively. The proposed model has also been applied for multi-step week-ahead daily forecasting with an improvement of 8.368% and 20.99% in MAPE against the LSTM-based model for the utilized energy consumption datasets respectively.  2013 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 03:02:53","","33498-33511","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061370","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Learning systems; Forecasting; Benchmarking; Smart power grids; Energy utilization; Electric power transmission; Electric loads; Energy conservation; Intelligent buildings; Model buildings; deep learning; Data models; Predictive models; Energy consumption; Load modeling; Appliances energy forecasting; bidirectional LSTM; hybrid model; Long short term memory; power forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of at least 3.3% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (51% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled, on average across the datasets). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy  our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data.

It is a global problem which has led to loss of lives and properties and known to have negative impacts on tourism and global economy. Terrorism has also been associated with high level of insecurity and most nations of the world are interested in any research efforts that can reduce its menace. Most of the research efforts on terrorism have focused on measures to fight terrorism or how to reduce the activities of terrorists but there are limited efforts on terrorism prediction. The aim of this work is to develop an ensemble machine learning model which combines Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor for prediction of continents susceptible to terrorism. Data was obtained from Global Terrorism Database and data preprocessing included data cleaning and dimensionality reduction. Two feature selection techniques, Chi-squared, Information Gain and a hybrid of both were applied to the dataset before modeling. Ensemble machine learning models were then constructed and applied on the selected features.

Nowadays, various artificial intelligence (AI) based methods are utilized to perform optimal energy forecasting, different simulation tools, and engineering methods to predict future demand based on historical data. Nevertheless, nonlinear energy demand modeling is still unfledged for a better solution to handle short-term and long-term dependencies and avoid static nature because it is purely on historical data-driven. In this paper, we propose an ensemble deep learning-based approach to predict and forecast energy demand and consumption by using chronological dependencies. Our system initially processes the data, cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the model performance. Furthermore, the preprocess data is fed to proposed ensemble model to extract hybrid discriminative features by using convolution neural network (CNN), stacked, and bi-directional long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. We trained our proposed system on the historical data to forecast the energy demand and consumption with a different time interval. In the proposed technique, we utilized the concept of active learning based on moving windows to ensure and improve the prediction performance of the system.

This issue may seriously affect the data quality in some fields, such as transportation. A typical IoT application in transportation is electronic registration identification of the motor vehicle (ERI), an emerging traffic data acquisition technology based on RFID. ERI data play a vital role in intelligent transportation. However, the data quality is often affected seriously by the inaccurate timestamps, which arise from the time-unsynchronized distributed ERI readers. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, data repairing of time synchronization problems (DR-TSP), which can detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and correct timestamp-deviated ERI data. Precisely, DR-TSP consists of three components. Problem reader discovery component employs a statistics-based method to detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and discovers the clock leaps of the problematic ERI reader through a smoothing-based method. Travel-time estimation component constructs a spatial correlative travel-time estimation model based on the neural network to infer timestamp deviation. The influence of clock deviation is considered in the model training. Data correction component utilizes the above results to correct the timestamp-deviated data. Experiments over large-scale ERI data collected from a big China city, Chongqing, show that our method can significantly improve data quality.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 14:06:44","","11666-11677","","14","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3058640","Technology transfer; Internet of things; Advanced traffic management systems; Data acquisition; Clocks; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Synchronization; Travel time; Internet of Things; Data models; Roads; Sensors; Data cleaning and repairing; radio-frequency identification (RFID); Radiofrequency identification; time synchronization problem; travel-time estimation model; OUTLIER DETECTION; THINGS; INTERNET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prelude to any successful analytical model building and implementation phase is a properly conducted initial data analysis stage. IDA encompasses laborious tasks of data cleansing: missing value treatment, outlier detection, checking the veracity of data, data transformation, and thus preparing data for model building. A systematic, disciplined, and non-personalized approach to IDA reduces the probability of incorrect and inaccurate results from the model. The amount of data presented for model building today makes the IDA stage a very crucial task which cannot be manually conducted. Machine learning can be applied to analyze complex and bigger data, find patterns accurately, etc. Hence, it could also be used for data preparation prior to model building.

In this paper, we present some recent results on brain lesion segmentation. While algorithms have been developed to automate the procec, the results often lack accuracy in tracing the lesions. Here, we present our results on the publically available ATLAS R1.1 dataset using deep CNN architectures. We utilize a deep U-net architecture with 3D convolutions, consisting of an encoder and a corresponding decoder along with dense residual connections between them, leveraging both low and high level features from the encoder at each step. We also analyze the use of Inception, Residual and Inception-Res blocks for the encoder. The architecture also makes use of an attention gate for the decoder part to supprec irrelevant parts of the incoming input while highlighting the salient features. The dataset had 239 3D MRI images of dimensions (197 x 233 x 189) with their corresponding segmentation maps. We used a train-validation-test split of 7:2:1, employing mean normalization, histogram equalization and suitable data augmentation techniques. We used SGD optimizer with focal Tversky loc function. The Dice score and AUC were used as metrics. We were able to achieve a Dice coefficient of 0.53 with an AUC around 0.95 with a single end-to-end model, unlike previous models that either focus only on one part of the brain or use other metadata, and matched their performance in every aspect.

The time-series analysis is performed by transforming data into a common domain for clustering. The data are collected from a tugboat to investigate the correlation between environmental and location data with fuel consumption to achieve fuel efficiency. The relevant parameters that influence the fuel consumption of the tugboat, such as fuel consumption, vessel route, vessel speed and wind metrics are collected from sensors installed onboard the ship and data provider to monitor and to gauge the vessel's performance. The raw readings are conditioned (data cleaning and data pre-processing) before transformation to Score Dataset: the Raw mass-flowrate readings are cleaned by using the Haar wavelet; the wind raw reading is converted to wind effect data; the Location data is converted to vessel speed data. Together, they form a Score Dataset by applying the time series K-means clustering. The subsequent unsupervised learning identifies the activity labels that describe qualitatively the operations of the vessels and are obtained by using the non-time series K-mean clustering. By using the Hidden Markov Model approach, this paper attempts to explain the stochastic correlation among parameters explained earlier. The correlation is the information of newly discovered knowledge in terms of likelihood matrices, also known as the knowledge base (KB). The KB may be consumed to perform predictions. Hence, it is possible to suggest the optimal ship operation, i.e., speed that produces the optimum fuel consumption. The Score Dataset and clustering that are produced in this paper could also be used in the Artificial Neural Network for future work.

In order to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of results, data cleansing is the first step in analyzing 4D trajectory data, including error identification and mitigation. Data cleansing techniques for the 4D trajectory data are investigated. Back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is applied to repair errors. Newton interpolation method is used to obtain even-spaced trajectory samples over a uniform distribution of each flight's 4D trajectory data. Furthermore, a new method is proposed to compress data while maintaining the intrinsic characteristics of the trajectories. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is applied to identify remaining outliers of sample points. Experiments are performed on a data set of one-day 4D trajectory data over Europe. The results show that the proposed method can achieve more efficient and effective results than the existing approaches.

Unlike their plain counterparts, which tend to provide overconfident decisions and cannot identify samples they have not been specifically trained for, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks provide a reliable measure of classification uncertainty.

However, minimal considerations have been given to how the resilience of CNNs can be improved algorithmically as opposed to via enhanced hardware. This paper focuses on RF-processing CNNs and performs an in-depth analysis of applying software-based error detection and correction mechanisms, which may subsequently be combined with protections of radiation-hardened processor platforms. These techniques are more accessible for low cost smallsat platforms than ruggedized hardware. Additionally, methods for minimizing the memory and computational complexity of the resulting resilience techniques are identified.

Therefore, many petrophysical and geophysical workflows include sonic log synthetization or pseudo-log generation based on multivariate regression or rock physics relations. Started on March 1,2020, and concluded on May 7, 2020, the SPWLA PDDA SIG hosted a contest aiming to predict the DTC and DTS logs from seven ""easy-to-acquire"" conventional logs using machine-learning methods (GitHub, 2020). In the contest, a total number of 20,525 data points with half-foot resolution from three wells was collected to train regression models using machine-learning techniques. Each data point had seven features, consisting of the conventional ""easy-to-acquire"" logs: caliper, neutron porosity, gamma ray (GR), deep resistivity, medium resistivity, photoelectric factor, and bulk density, respectively, as well as two sonic logs (DTC and DTS) as the target. The separate data set of 11,089 samples from a fourth well was then used as the blind test data set.

To support growing planning and control decision-making, the need for large numbers of short-term load forecasts has emerged. Data-driven modelling of medium voltage feeders can be affected by (1) data quality issues, namely, large gross errors and missing observations (2) the presence of structural breaks in the data due to occasional network reconfiguration and load transfers. The present work investigates and reports on the effects of advanced data cleansing techniques on forecast accuracy. A hybrid framework to detect and remove outliers in large datasets is proposed; this automatic procedure combines the Tukey labelling rule and the binary segmentation algorithm to cleanse data more efficiently, it is fast and easy to implement. Various approaches for missing value imputation are investigated, including unconditional mean, Hot Deck via k-nearest neighbour and Kalman smoothing. A combination of the automatic detection/removal of outliers and the imputation methods mentioned above are implemented to cleanse time series of 342 medium-voltage feeders. A nested rolling-origin-validation technique is used to evaluate the feed-forward deep neural network models. The proposed data cleansing framework efficiently removes outliers from the data, and the accuracy of forecasts is improved. It is found that Hot Deck (k-NN) imputation performs best in balancing the bias-variance trade-off for short-term forecasting.  2019","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:43","2022-07-31 04:32:16","","","","","261","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114405","Anomaly detection; Forecasting; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Economic and social effects; Electric power plant loads; Feeding; Outlier detection; Binary segmentation; Distribution systems; Kalman smoothing; Multi-step forecasts; PERFORMANCE; TIME-SERIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preparing data set to be used in machine learning is an important task to map between raw data input (cause) and output (result) relation. Google traces are dump tables that contain raw data about data center servers, workload jobs and tasks status, workload demands, data center provisioned resources and hardware reconfiguration. Machine learning considers input data set and output data set as a training learning model by relating these two correlated sets as normalized values for future use. In this work, a data cleaning and full analysis for Google data center traces have been done to be used in deep machine learning models, like conventional neural network or recurrent neural network with capability of using inline learning model. Data set are processed by re-normalizing resources capacities and workloads demands (jobs and tasks), and by removing or transforming non-Available and opaque values into useful values. A novel correlation between input and output data sets for Google traces is introduced that relates workload demands with data center resources reconfiguration, and data center resources with data center capacity. The idea is to connect between demands and provisioned resources by evaluating the cloud data center configuration sets, which allows cloud manager to provision resources by setting up the best reconfiguration in scaling cloud data center. An evaluation factor (scale factor) has been introduced to evaluate elastic provisioning resources considering resources preparation time and minimum cost.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:43","2022-07-31 13:37:25","","","","","","","","","2019 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking, SmartNets 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets48225.2019.9069765","Machine learning; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Cloud computing; Metadata; Personnel training; Reconfigurable hardware; Data models; Task analysis; Data centers; Data Cleaning; Google; Google Traces; Logs Analysis; Logs Correlation; Random access memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data management is at the heart of many ML systems due to data-driven application characteristics, data-centric workload characteristics, and system architectures inspired by classical data management techniques. In this book, we follow this data-centric view of ML systems and aim to provide a comprehensive overview of data management in ML systems for the end-to-end data science or ML lifecycle. We review multiple interconnected lines of work: (1) ML support in database (DB) systems, (2) DB-inspired ML systems, and (3) ML lifecycle systems. Covered topics include: in-database analytics via query generation and user-defined functions, factorized and statistical-relational learning; optimizing compilers for ML workloads; execution strategies and hardware accelerators; data access methods such as compression, partitioning and indexing; resource elasticity and cloud markets; as well as systems for data preparation for ML, model selection, model management, model debugging, and model serving. Given the rapidly evolving field, we strive for a balance between an up-to-date survey of ML systems, an overview of the underlying concepts and techniques, as well as pointers to open research questions.

Then, based on Yolo (You only look once) v5, a weakly supervised and phased transfer learning method is proposed to recognise insulators and ice types such as snow, rime, mixed rime, glaze, and the normal. This method reduces the interference of icing background, uneven illumination, and camera occlusion through multidimensional feature fusion. The precision, recall, and mean average precision of the recognition can reach 86.6%, 91.3%, and 90.1%, respectively, and the recognition speed is as fast as 8ms/image. Using image pseudo-labelling based on weakly supervised learning enables the intellectualisation of image annotation, which significantly changes the inefficiency of manual labelling. 2022 The Authors.

Software 2.0) where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. As machine learning is used in sensitive applications, it becomes imperative that the trained model is accurate, fair, and robust to attacks. While many techniques have been proposed to improve the model training process (in-processing approach) or the trained model itself (post-processing), we argue that the most effective method is to clean the root cause of error: the data the model is trained on (pre-processing). Historically, there are at least three research communities that have been separately studying this problem: data management, machine learning (model fairness), and security. Although a significant amount of research has been done by each community, ultimately the same datasets must be preprocessed, and there is little understanding how the techniques relate to each other and can possibly be integrated. We contend that it is time to extend the notion of data cleaning for modern machine learning needs. We identify dependencies among the data preprocessing techniques and propose MLClean, a unified data cleaning framework that integrates the techniques and helps train accurate and fair models.

For a given dataset and data analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal result quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start with or which methods to use. Most current work can be classified into two categories: (1) they propose new data cleaning algorithms specific to certain types of data anomalies usually considered in isolation and without a ""pipeline vision"" of the entire data preprocessing strategy; (2) they develop automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of a considered ML model with a list of by-default preprocessing methods. We argue that more efforts should be devoted to proposing a principled and adaptive data preparation approach to help and learn from the user for selecting the optimal sequence of data preparation tasks to obtain the best quality performance of the final result. In this paper, we extend Learn2Clean, a method based on Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that selects, for a given dataset, a given ML model, and a preselected quality performance metric, the optimal sequence of tasks for preprocessing the data such that the quality metric is maximized.

The early detection of abnormal operation conditions can prevent failure status, which takes a long time to recover. Energy waste can also be reduced while maintenance efficiency can be improved by using a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor the operation status of wind turbines. Massive data are generated from different sensors during wind turbine operation, and SCADA can be used to gather reports about hundreds of possible abnormal conditions. The popular maintenance methods have been mostly designed on the basis of statistical analysis and data mining. However, such schemes need not only big data but also sophisticated processing techniques. This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing a deep learning model with comprehensive data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on batch size to achieve abnormal early detection. The necessary data preprocessing is initially conducted besides the conventional data cleaning and normalization steps, and time-series data windowing and label settings are also performed. Then, the imbalanced classes in the records are addressed by adopting an augmentation scheme called the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Principal component analysis is also used to enhance the training. Finally, the proposed deep learning method with fine-tuning is compared with three machine learning models for early anomaly event detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can identify potential faults 72 hours before they occur, and the precision rate exceeds 90 %.  2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:44","2022-07-31 04:42:17","","5323-5333","","12","35","","Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12206-021-1105-z","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Machine learning; Wind power; Wind turbines; Maintenance; Data mining; Data acquisition; Condition monitoring; Principal component analysis; Predictive maintenance; Electric power generation; Wind turbine; DIAGNOSIS; Data argumentation; FAULT-DETECTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structural evaluation and inspection of tunnels are vital tasks to assess the deterioration of tunnels and maintain their level of service. Researchers have developed many predictive models that describe the deterioration of various infrastructure systems using data from formal inspections. However, there is a lack of research that developed predictive models of deterioration of tunnels in the US. Therefore, this paper investigated the feasibility of using various machine learning techniques to develop a computational data-driven decision support tool that predicts the deterioration of tunnels in the US. An ex ante framework for predicting the deterioration of tunnels in the US was developed. The research methodology comprised (1) collecting, cleaning, and standardizing data for tunnels in the US from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); (2) identifying the best subset of variables that allow predicting the deterioration of tunnels; (3) utilizing existing machine learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machine (SVM), to develop classification models that predict the deterioration of tunnels; (4) optimizing the accuracy of the developed models by determining the best set of hyperparameters that result in the most accurate performance; (5) comparing the performance of the developed models and selecting the best performing model to be used as a decision support tool; and (6) evaluating and validating the performance of the selected model. The results identified 18 variables that greatly affect the deterioration of tunnels, with the tunnel width having the greatest impact on the prediction of deterioration of tunnels. Results indicated that the RF algorithm reached an accuracy of 85.38%, which was the highest accuracy, compared with KNN, ANN, and SVM, which reached an accuracy of 80.12%, 56.14%, and 56.73%, respectively. In addition, the entropy criterion function with a maximum of five features and 500 estimators successfully constructed the best hyperparameters for the selected RF model. Therefore, the developed decision support tool can be used by transportation entities to estimate the overall condition of tunnels based on specific tunnel parameters with reasonable prediction accuracy. It also can aid decision makers in developing, optimizing, and prioritizing maintenance plans and allocation of funding.","2021-10-01","2022-06-10 02:10:44","2022-07-31 13:54:43","","04021125 (14 pp.)","","10","147","","Journal of Construction Engineering and Management","","J.

While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised learning techniques. In this paper we propose original ideas that help us to leverage such datasets in the context of change detection. First, we propose the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level labels.

Data scientists pose hypotheses, integrate the necessary data, and run ML pipelines of data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The repetitive nature of these workflows, and their hierarchical composition from building blocks exhibits high computational redundancy. Existing work addresses this redundancy with coarse-grained lineage tracing and reuse for ML pipelines. This approach allows using existing ML systems, but views entire algorithms as black boxes, and thus, fails to eliminate fine-grained redundancy and to handle internal non-determinism. In this paper, we introduce LIMA, a practical framework for efficient, fine-grained lineage tracing and reuse inside ML systems. Lineage tracing of individual operations creates new challenges and opportunities. We address the large size of lineage traces with multi-level lineage tracing and reuse, as well as lineage deduplication for loops and functions; exploit full and partial reuse opportunities across the program hierarchy; and integrate this framework with task parallelism and operator fusion. The resulting framework performs fine-grained lineage tracing with low overhead, provides versioning and reproducibility, and is able to eliminate fine-grained redundancy.

Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision - depth, breadth, and usability - to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.","2021-01-14","2022-06-10 02:10:45","2022-07-31 04:34:30","","12 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","data handling; learning (artificial intelligence)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, high performance often requires large datasets with high-quality annotations, especially for segmentation, which requires precise pixel-wise labelling. The difficulty of generating high-quality datasets often constrains the improvement of research in such areas. To alleviate this issue, we propose a weakly supervised learning method for nuclei segmentation that only requires annotation of the nuclear centroid. To train the segmentation model with point annotations, we first generate boundary and superpixel-based masks as pseudo ground truth labels to train a segmentation network that is enhanced by a mask-guided attention auxiliary network. Then to further improve the accuracy of supervision, we apply Confident Learning to correct the pseudo labels at the pixel-level for a refined training.

However, the effectiveness of the AAL systems depends on the accuracy of the data provided by sensors. Namely, when a human error or a hardware failure occurs, the activity recognition model can become inaccurate. This inaccuracy hinders the identification of critical and potentially life-threatening activities. Although there are many methods for cleaning sensor data, there is no method for binary sensors deployed in smart homes. By considering noisy sensor events and unintentional forgetting of turning off the device, this paper proposes two clustering-based methods for denoising and splitting binary sensor events to address possible inaccuracy due to the two mentioned problems. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by the experiments using four machine learning models and three real-world smart home datasets and adopting different sensor configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to the original unprocessed datasets, by combining the two proposed methods, the average accuracy and F-measure are improved by 15.00% and 17.25%, respectively.  2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:46","2022-07-31 03:02:06","","478-495","","","12787 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Virtual, Online","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78111-8_33","Automation; Pattern recognition; Intelligent buildings; Ambient intelligence; Assisted living; Cognitive systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, since well performance is impacted by many factors (e.g., geological characteristics, completion design, well design, etc.), the challenge is uncovering trends from all the noise. By leveraging basin-level knowledge captured by big data sculpting, integrating private and public data with the use of uncertainty quantification, Augmented AI (a combination of expert-based knowledge and advanced AI frameworks) can provide quick and science-based answers for well spacing and fracking optimization and assess the full potential of an asset in unconventional reservoirs. Augmented AI is artificial intelligence powered by engineering wisdom. The Augmented AI workflow starts with data sculpting, which includes information retrieval, data cleaning and standardization, and finally a smart, deep and systematic data QC. Feature engineering generates all the relevant parameters going into the machine learning model-over 50 features have been generated for this work and categorized. The final step is to perform model tuning and ensemble, evaluating the model robustness, generating model explanation and uncertainty quantification. Augmented AI adopts an iterative machine learning modeling approach. This approach combines new and innovative engineering and G&G workflows with data-driven models so that a deep understanding of the field behavior can be developed. Loops from feature selection to model tuning are used until good model results are achieved. The loop is automated using Bayesians optimization. All machine learning models have different strengths and weaknesses for prediction. Instead of manually determining which machine learning model to use, this approach uses an adaptive ensemble machine learning approach that is a stacking algorithm that combines multiple regression models via a second level machine learning model. It smartly aggregates opinions from different models with reduced variance and better robustness. Augmented AI has been applied in unconventional reservoirs with great results. A case study in Midland Basin is presented in this paper. Domain-induced feature engineering was performed to obtain important features for predicting well performance, and initial feature selection was conducted using feature correlation analysis. A trusted and explainable ML model was built and enhanced with uncertainty quantification. After running several sensitivity analyses, Augmented AI optimized the attributes of interest, then vetted the outcome, generating a report and visualizing the results. In addition, further information about the direct impact of well spacing on EUR was deconvoluted from other parameters using an ML explanation technique for Wolfcamp Formation in Permian Basin and subsequently well spacing optimization was presented for the case study in Midland Basin. An innovative model was created using Augmented AI to optimize well spacing, leveraging big data sculpting, domain and physics-induced feature engineering, and machine learning. The learning was transferred from the basin model to the specific region of interest. Augmented AI provides efficient and systematic private data organization, an explainable machine learning model, robust production forecast with quantified uncertainty and well spacing and frac parameters optimization. Augmented AI models are already built for major basins such as Midland and Delaware basins. The learning and knowledge of the model can be transferred to any region in a basin and can be refined using more accurate private data. This allows conclusions to be drawn even with a limited number of wells.

Based on this framework, an error-correcting table based SCC-SCL (ET-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme is proposed, by introducing the look-up-table based CRC error correction method into the segmented Polar SCL decoding process. Since the error correction capability is limited by the size of the look-up table, which in turn limits the performance gain, we further propose a deep learning based SCC-SCL (DL-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme. In this scheme, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network replaces the error correction table to perform error correction, combining the sequence of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) with the syndromes to determine the error patterns. Simulation results show that both of the proposed decoding schemes have significant performance gain over the classic CRC error-detection aided SCL decoding scheme.

After that, noisy attributes in erroneous records are detected using correct records and the repeated values. To correct the detected noises, a supervised ensemble learning model is constructed for each attribute. The ensemble model consists of a Bayes classifier, a decision tree, and a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). A majority of votes is used as the combination strategy in the ensemble learning model.

However, recent research shows that current machine learning algorithms for power systems can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are small designed perturbations crafted on normal inputs that can greatly affect the overall performance of the predictor. Even with only a partial compromise of the network, an attacker could intercept and adversarially modify data from some smart meters in a limited range to make the load predictor deviate from normal prediction results. In this paper, we leverage the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm and propose a novel data repair framework to defend against these kinds of adversarial attacks. This framework complements the predictor with a self-representative auto-encoder and works in an iterative manner. The auto-encoder is used to detect and reconstruct the likely adversarial part in the input data. Different reconstruction results come up given different sensitivity levels in detection. As new data flows in each iterative time step, the service provider continuously checks the error of the previous prediction step and dynamically trades off between different detection sensitivity levels to seek an overall stable data reconstruction. Case studies on power network load forecast regression demonstrate the vulnerability of current machine learning algorithms and correspondingly the effectiveness of our defense framework.  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:46","2022-07-31 04:57:03","","102-109","","","12312 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61725-7_14","Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Iterative methods; Forecasting; Deep neural networks; Network security; Signal encoding; Internet service providers; Electric power plant loads; Data transfer; Electric network analysis; Smart meters; Dynamic data repair, Load forecasting, Adversarial attacks, Power systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machinesrdquo vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:47","2022-07-31 05:54:46","","012022 (6 pp.)","","","852","","","","IOP Conf.

For data analytics and accurate prediction, data cleansing is highly desired and recommended. The goal of this study is to predict diabetic patients using realworld datasets. The proposed approach is based on three main steps: cleansing, modelling, and storytelling. In the first step, an imputation process is conducted to remove missing values. Then, k-nearest neighbor's algorithm is applied to classify patients. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, two criteria, namely the F1 score and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) has been used.

As such, significant research effort has been devoted to automate the repair process. Yet it still requires significant manual labor by the Data Scientists, tweaking and optimizing repair modules (up to 80% of their time, according to surveys). To this end, we propose in this paper a novel framework for explaining the results of any data repair module. Explanations involve identifying the table cells and database constraints having the strongest influence on the process. Influence, in turn, is quantified through the game-theoretic notion of Shapley values, commonly used for explaining Machine Learning classifier results. The main technical challenge is that exact computation of Shapley values incurs exponential time. We consequently devise and optimize novel approximation algorithms, and analyze them both theoretically and empirically. Our results show the efficiency of our approach when compared to the alternative of adapting existing Shapley value computation techniques to the data repair settings.  2021 ACM.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:47","2022-07-31 13:50:09","","362-371","","","","","","","International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Virtual, Online, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3482341","Repair; Learning systems; Approximation algorithms; Game theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For imagery containing biological structures with depth, it is especially desirable to perform these tasks in 3D. Traditionally, performing these tasks simultaneously in 3D has proven to be computationally expensive. Currently available methodologies thus largely work to segment 3D objects from 2D images (without context from captured 3D volumes). In this work, we present a novel approach to perform fast and accurate localization, detection, and segmentation of volumes containing cells. Specifically, in our method, we modify and tune two state-of-the-art CNNs, namely 2D YOLOv2 and 3D U-Net, and combine them with a new fusion and image processing algorithms. Annotated volumes in this space are limited, and we have created synthetic data that mimics actual structures for training and testing our proposed approach.

This information is then transmitted to a central station for further processing through wireless communication. However, the wireless medium is considered vulnerable and the sensors can fail in providing correct measurements. Moreover, a smart home system should also be able to implement a cleaning system of its sensed data and discard those instances that are erroneous or incoherent. To achieve the data quality improvements, this paper proposes a new approach that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect faulty measurements. The proposed scheme can prematurely and efficiently detect outlier data before forwarding it to a central station.

This paper aims to qualitatively assess the possibilities for using machine learning in the process of detecting data incompleteness and inaccuracy, since these two data quality dimensions were found to be the most significant by a previous research study conducted by the authors. A review of existing literature concludes that there is no unique machine learning algorithm most suitable to deal with both incompleteness and inaccuracy of data. Various algorithms are selected from existing studies and applied against a representative big (healthcare) dataset. Following experiments, it was also discovered that the implementation of machine learning algorithms in this context encounters several challenges for Big Data quality activities. These challenges are related to the amount of data particualar machine learning algorithms can scale to and also to certain data type restrictions imposed by some machine learning algorithms. The study concludes that 1) data imputation works better with linear regression models, 2) clustering models are more efficient to detect outliers but fully automated systems may not be realistic in this context.

The traditional kick-detection method mainly relies on the driller's analysis of monitored compound comprehensive mud-logging data. However, the traditional method has significant time lag, including missed and false detection, and often leads to severe gas influxes during deepwater drilling. A novel machine-learning (ML) model is presented here using pilot-scale rig data combined with surface-riser-downhole monitoring for gas-kick early detection and risk classification. A series of pilot-scale test-well experiments (a total of 108 tests) are performed to simulate deepwater gas kicks and produce a multisource data set through fusion of comprehensive mud-logging data from surface monitoring, acoustic data from riser-monitoring technologies, and measurement-while-drilling data [e.g., bottomhole pressure (BHP)] from downhole monitoring technologies. During these experiments, the deepwater blowout preventer (BOP) is simulated using a variable cross section of crossover (X/O; equipped with booster-flow pipes); the Coriolis flowmeter is installed in the mud-return pipe to accurately measure flow out; the acoustic wave sensors are installed outside of the riser section (X/O) to monitor gas migration; and the downhole memory pressure gauges are installed to monitor BHP. Next, data preparation and data analysis are performed including raw-data exploration, data cleaning, signal/noise-ratio (SNR) analysis, feature scaling, outlier detection, and feature engineering. Further, a novel and improved data-labeling criterion for gas-kick alarms is proposed, with six levels (displayed using different colors) instead of two-state alarms (""kick"" or ""no kick""). The proposed gas-kick-alarm classification is in accordance with the actual field practices. Subsequently, four ML algorithms-decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM)-are developed through the complete workflow, beginning with the data allocation and followed by building, evaluation, and optimization of each ML model. Because the LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm showed the best performance, it is selected and deployed to early detect gas kicks and classify the corresponding kick alarms. The recall for gas-kick levels corresponding to Risk 0, Risk 1, Risk 2, Risk 3, Risk 4, and Risk 5 are 0.92, 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.92, respectively. Because recall for each gas-kick-alarm level is greater than 0.9, it ensures rare false negatives (FNs) during kick detection. The accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score of the deployed LSTM model in the testing data set is 91.6%, 0.93, 0.92 and 0.92, respectively. Further, the detection time delay is approximately 2 to 7 seconds only, which provides an improved time margin to take appropriate safety measures, promptly deal with a gas kick through a well-control program, and prevent a potential blowout during deepwater drilling.  2021 Society of Petroleum Engineers","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:48","2022-07-31 05:29:21","","1773-1799","","4","26","","SPE Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/205365-PA","Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Data handling; Learning systems; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Statistical tests; Nearest neighbor search; Acoustic logging; Infill drilling; Gases; Alarm systems; Blowouts; Bottom hole pressure; Deepwater drilling; Drilling machines (machine tools); Flowmeters; Logging while drilling; Mud logging; Oil field development; Petroleum prospecting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arthroscopy and Laparoscopy surgeries are considered Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS). In MIS, the surgeon operates through small incisions with specialized narrow instruments, fiberoptic lights, and a monitor. Arthroscopy surgery is used to diagnose and treat joints problems, and Laparoscopic procedures are performed on the abdominal cavity. Due to non-natural hand-eye coordination, narrow field-of-view, and limited instrument control, MIS training is challenging to master. We are analyzing two simulators' data, Virtual Arthroscopic Tear Diagnosis and Evaluation Platform (VATDEP) and Gentleness Simulator. Both simulators went through the validation studies with human subjects. We recorded simulation data during the validation studies, such as tool motion, position, and task time. Recorded data went through the data preprocessing; after the data cleaning, we extracted the recoded data features and normalized them. Normalized features were used to input various machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic regression (LR). The average accuracy was evaluated through k-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods validated using 10 subjects (5 experts, 5 novices) for the VATDEP simulator. 23 subjects (4 experts and 19 novices) for the Gentleness Simulator. The result shows a significant difference between the expert and novice population with the p  0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The VATDEP simulator's classification algorithms' average accuracy is 74% and 80% for the Gentleness Simulator. The results show that the normalized features and with KNN, SVM, and LR classifiers can provide accurate classification of experts and novices.

The importance of this analysis comes from many reasons, one of them is that it leads to a better understanding of the system components. This paper presents a clustering algorithm for residential energy consumption using the K-Means algorithm in two different approaches. The dataset utilized in this article contains energy consumption features selected from 25 houses over a period of two years. Firstly, data cleaning has been used to remove and eliminate the inconsistent data, secondly the Elbow method has been applied to determine the optimal number of clusters before using the K-means approach for the purpose of clustering. In Kmeans, the data have been clustered into two different approaches. The first one is clustering the daily mean consumption in each season in each year. The second one is clustering the monthly mean consumption over the two years. Finally, data visualization has been applied in order to present the result of our proposed method. The paper finds that the households have different consumption behaviors in different seasons, days, and months and that it is due to the change of the average temperature in each season as well as the different appliances and consumptive patters of each house. The results are representative and match the aim of the paper. Further, they are significant for the further development of the energy system and efficient for tracking the consumption of the houses. Finally, the results of this paper are going to be used after running the algorithm again with a different number of clusters to compare the results and find new insights in the data that might affect the decision.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:48","2022-07-31 14:00:02","","","","","","","","","2021 22nd International Arab Conference on Information Technology, ACIT 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Muscat, Oman","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACIT53391.2021.9677130","Machine learning; Data visualization; K-means clustering; Energy efficiency; Consumer behavior; Energy utilization; Houses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The long-term preservation of data, using backup data for the operation and maintenance, fault recovery, fault drill and tracking of cloud platform are essential. The traditional compression algorithm faces severe challenges. Methods: In this case, this paper proposes the deep-learning method for data compression. First, a more accurate and complete grid cloud resource status data is gathered through data cleaning, correction, and standardization, the preprocessed data is then compressed by SaDE-MSAE. Results: Experiments show that the SaDE-MSAE method can compress data faster. The data compression ratio based on neural network is basically between 45% and 60%, which is relatively stable and stronger than the traditional compression algorithm. Conclusion: The paper can compress the data quickly and efficiently in a large amount of power data. Improve the speed and accuracy of the algorithm while ensuring that the data is correct and complete, and improve the compression time and efficiency through the neural network.

This research mainly uses machine learning clustering algorithm to simulate customer loyalty. Call the k-means interactive mining algorithm based on the Hash structure to perform data mining on the multidimensional hierarchical tree of corporate credit risk, continuously adjust the support thresholds for different levels of data mining according to specific requirements and select effective association rules until satisfactory results are obtained. After conducting credit risk assessment and early warning modeling for the enterprise, the initial preselected model is obtained. The information to be collected is first obtained by the web crawler from the target website to the temporary web page database, where it will go through a series of preprocessing steps such as completion, deduplication, analysis, and extraction to ensure that the crawled web page is correctly analyzed, to avoid incorrect data due to network errors during the crawling process.

Vertical plant wall systems, embedded with sensors and actuators, have become a promising application for indoor climate control. In this study, we explore the possibility of applying machine learning based anomaly detection methods to vertical plant wall systems so as to enhance the automation and improve the intelligence to realize predictive maintenance of the indoor climate. Two categories of anomalies, namely point anomalies and contextual anomalies are researched. Prediction-based and pattern recognition-based methods are investigated and applied to indoor climate anomaly detection. The results show that neural network-based models, specifically the autoencoder (AE) and the long short-term memory encoder decoder (LSTM-ED) model surpass the others in terms of detecting point anomalies and contextual anomalies, respectively, therefore can be deployed into vertical plant walls systems in industrial practice. Based on the results, a new data cleaning method is proposed and a prediction-based method is deployed to the cloud in practice as a proof-of-concept.

This study presents a methodology and framework for building energy consumption raw data forecasting. A case building is used to forecast the energy consumption by using deep recurrent neural networks. Four different methodologies to impute missing data in the raw data set are compared and implemented. The question of sensitivity of gap size and available data percentage on the imputation accuracy was tested. The cleaned data were then used for building energy forecasting. While the existing studies explored only the use of small recurrent networks of 2 layers and less, the question of whether a deep network of more than 2 layers would be performing better for building energy consumption forecasting should be explored. In addition, the problem of overfitting has been cited as a significant problem in using deep networks. In this study, the deep recurrent neural network is then used to explore the use of deeper networks and their regularization in the context of an energy load forecasting task. The results show a mean absolute error of 2.1 can be achieved through the 2*32 gated neural network model.

With the infection of five new IoT devices per minute, the size of Mirai botnet was enlarged to 2.5 millions devices by the end of 2016. The continuous adaptation of the Mirai malware enables the modern variant to dynamically update its malware scripts on the fly to launch even more advanced and malevolent DDoS attacks, which dramatically escalates the level of difficulty with mitigating DDoS attacks. Many researchers endeavour to develop mitigation systems to keep up with the increasing security threats. Nonetheless, most presented models provide inefficient solutions either by utilising auxiliary servers at the host site, on the cloud or at dedicated data scrubbing centres. Since internet service providers (ISPs) connect the internet with users, the mitigation system should be deployed within the ISP domain to deliver a more efficient solution. Accordingly, we propose a stacked self-organising map, which is a feature dynamic deep learning approach that utilises netflow data collected by the ISP to combat the dynamic nature of novel DDoS attacks.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:49","2022-07-31 13:43:57","","53-70","","1","19","","","","International Journal of Information Security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10207-019-00453-y","Deep learning; Internet of things; Network security; Unsupervised learning; Conformal mapping; Denial-of-service attack; Internet service providers; Malware; Self organizing maps; SOM, Network security, IoT, Cyber security, Machine learning attacks, DDoS mitigation, Unsupervised learning, Self organizing map, Deep learning; SYSTEM; Cyber security; DDoS mitigation; DEFENSE; IoT; Machine learning attacks; Self organizing map; SOM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hyper-parameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyper-parameter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.","2019-04-26","2022-06-10 02:10:49","2022-07-31 03:32:28","","15 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","data handling; learning (artificial intelligence); data mining; optimisation; query processing; search problems; SQL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The applications like search engines, information retrieval, emails, etc., require user typing. In such applications, good spell-checker is essential to rectify the misspelling. Spell-checkers for western languages like English are very powerful and can handle any type of spelling errors, whereas in the case of Indian languages like Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kannada, Assamese, etc., the available spell-checkers are very basic ones. These spell-checkers are developed using traditional methods like statistical methods and rule-based methods. This article presents a novel model HINDIA to handle the spelling errors of the Hindi language, one of the most spoken languages in India. It utilizes a deep-learning method for spelling error detection and correction. The proposed spell-checking model works in two phases. In the first phase model identifies the erroneous words in the input sample and in the second phase it replaces the wrong words with the most probable correct words. Model HINDIA is developed using the attention-based encoderdecoder bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) which uses long short-term memory cells. Several modifications in the BiRNN have been made and network is fine-tuned to process the spelling errors of Hindi language. It uses publicly available dataset monolingual corpus developed by IIT Mumbai for training and testing. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in two scenarios. In the first scenario where the testing dataset is generated using split function. HINDIA performs significantly well with precision 0.86, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.78 and accuracy 0.80. Further, in the second scenario, where a dataset is manually generated its performance is fairly good with precision 0.81, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.76 and accuracy 0.74. Model HINDIA gives better performance than the deep-learning-based Malayalam spell-checker and some other deep-learning-based correction models present in the literature.  2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:49","2022-08-10 19:20:14","","3825-3840","","8","33","","Neural Computing and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05207-9","Long short-term memory; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Errors; Statistical tests; Search engines; Spell-checker, Encoder–decoder recurrent neural network, Long short-term memory, Spelling, Deep-learning; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; Deep-learning; Encoder-decoder recurrent neural network; SENSORS; Spell-checker; Spelling; Long short-term memory, Encoder–decoder recurrent neural network, Spelling, Spell-checker, Deep-learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As cities population size escalates, and roads getting congested, government agencies such as Department of Transportation (DOT) through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are in pressing need to perfect their management systems with new efficient technologies. The challenge is to anticipate on never before seen problems, in their effort to save lives and implement sustainable cost-effective management systems. To make things yet more complicated and a bit daunting, self-driving car will be authorized in a close future in crowded major cities where roads are to be shared among pedestrians, cyclists, cars, and trucks. Roads sizes and traffic signaling will need to be constantly adapted accordingly. Counting and classifying turning vehicles and pedestrians at an intersection is an exhausting task and despite traffic monitoring systems use, human interaction is heavily required for counting. Our approach to resolve traffic intersection turning-vehicles counting is less invasive, requires no road dig up or costly installation. Live or recorded videos from already installed camera all over the cities can be used as well as any camera including cellphones. Our system is based on Neural Network and Deep Learning of object detection along computer vision technology and several methods and algorithms. Our approach will work on still images, recorded-videos, real-time live videos and will detect, classify, track and compute moving object velocity and direction using convolution neural network.

Based on this view, we present PClean, a unified generative modeling architecture for cleaning and normalizing dirty data in diverse domains. Given an unclean dataset and a probabilistic program encoding relevant domain knowledge, PClean learns a structured representation of the data as a relational database of interrelated objects, and uses this latent structure to impute missing values, identify duplicates, detect errors, and propose corrections in the original data table. PClean makes three modeling and inference contributions: (i) a domain-general non-parametric generative model of relational data, for inferring latent objects and their network of latent connections; (ii) a domain-specific probabilistic programming language, for encoding domain knowledge specific to each dataset being cleaned; and (iii) a domain-general inference engine that adapts to each PClean program by constructing data-driven proposals used in sequential Monte Carlo and particle Gibbs. We show empirically that short ( 50-line) PClean programs deliver higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data cleaning systems based on machine learning and weighted logic; that PClean's inference algorithm is faster than generic particle Gibbs inference for probabilistic programs; and that PClean scales to large real-world datasets with millions of rows.","2020-07-23","2022-06-10 02:10:49","2022-07-31 04:54:44","","17 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","data handling; probability; Bayes methods; data structures; inference mechanisms; Monte Carlo methods; relational databases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novel algorithm is a combination of the factorization machine (FM) and the deep neural network (DNN), which adopts the one-vs-all strategy to fuse results from multiple base classifiers. 39,352 buildings affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake are taken as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-FMDNN. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model outperforms over many other popular machine learning methods due to the powerful feature learning ability, ultimately reaching an overall accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score in the value of 0.703, 0.737, and 0.702, respectively. Features associated with building structural characteristics are found to contribute more to classifying damage grades precisely. Besides, data preprocessing for data cleaning, encoding, and transformation is a necessary step to bring additional performance enhancement. For significance in the knowledge aspect, a novel multi-FMDNN algorithm is developed, which is superior in extracting both low- and high-order feature representation automatically from large volumes of destroyed buildings-related data and learning the optimal feature interactions simultaneously to pursue more accurate classification. For significance in the application aspect, the predicted results provide deep insights into a better understanding of the building vulnerability in seismic areas and inform data-driven decisions in disaster relief efforts. A promising future scope is to make full use of the available pre-event data along with some post-event data, which is possible to return fairly promising predictions and reduce the burden in earthquake field investigations for rapid responses. In future work, advanced techniques associated with data augment, hyperparameter optimization, and others will be implemented to constantly improve the overall accuracy and generalizability of the prediction model.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:49","2022-07-31 05:53:50","","","","","77","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103574","Factorization; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Network security; Network architecture; Metadata; Buildings; Disasters; Disaster prevention; Earthquakes; Automated evaluation; Deep neural network; Earthquake-induced building damage; Factorization machine; EARTHQUAKE RESILIENCE; EXPERT-SYSTEM; LOGIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Web pages that a search engine has scoured are first parsed to remove HTML elements and java scripts. After this phase, remove common keywords or stop words from the crawled pages. The affixes (prefix and suffix) from crawled pages are drawn by extracting keywords from the text. Finally, the collected keywords generate the similarity score between two papers. This research has proved that the suggested algorithms outperform earlier ones by conducting an extensive experimental investigation on several actual datasets. New algorithms outperform those already in use, according to the test findings. Since there are so many documents on the internet, web search engines have had difficulty finding relevant results for their customers. Overhead costs for search engines have risen dramatically due to an overabundance of almost similar or identical documents somehow. The web crawling community has long been aware of duplicate and near-identical online pages. Users want search engines to return relevant results for their searches on the first page, free of duplicates and redundancies. This is an important criterion. An essential enabler in the health industry is record or data linking, as connected data is an economic resource that may aid enhance research into health policy, detecting bad medication responses, and cutting expenses while uncovering health system fraud. Recent years have seen significant progress in several record linking approaches, mostly due to breakthroughs in data mining and machine learning. Most of these novel technologies have not yet been incorporated in current record linking systems or are disguised in commercial software as 'black boxes.' When it comes to learning about new record linking strategies and comparing old methods with new ones, this makes it difficult for users to do so. Innovative record-linking systems must be tested and implemented at low costs using flexible tools. FEBRL (Freely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage), a free, open-source software license system, is described in this work. Data cleansing and standardization, indexing (blocking), field comparisons, and record pair categorization are all included in this user-friendly graphical interface. When used as a training tool, practitioners may use Febrl to connect data sets with up to several hundred thousand records and learn about both old and novel description linking approaches.  2022 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:11:05","2022-07-31 03:13:22","","","","","","","","","Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Applied Informatics, ACCAI 2022","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Chennai, India","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCAI53970.2022.9752554","Open systems; Data integration; Data mining; Costs; Health; Indexing (of information); Websites; Open source software; HTML; Web crawler; Search engines; Hidden Markov models; data integration; data cleaning; Training; Databases; Couplings; Web pages; Java programming language; data matching; deduplication; Duplicates; GUI; HTML tags; Java Scripts; open source software; record linkage software; Stemming; Threshold.

We prove that disparate impact is upper bounded by the total variation distance between the distribution of the inputs given the protected attributes. We then use pre-processing, also known as data repair, to enforce fairness. We show that utility degradation, i.e., the extent that the success of a forecasting model changes by pre-processing the data, is upper bounded by the total variation distance between the distribution of the data before and after pre-processing. Hence, the problem of finding the optimal pre-processing regiment for enforcing fairness can be cast as minimizing total variations distance between the distribution of the data before and after pre-processing subject to a constraint on the total variation distance between the distribution of the inputs given protected attributes. This problem is a linear program that can be efficiently solved. We show that this problem is intimately related to finding the barycenter (i.e., center of mass) of two distributions when distances in the probability space are measured by total variation distance.

However, the battery is a complex electrochemical system with hardly observable and simulatable internal chemical reactions, and it is challenging to estimate the state of battery accurately. This paper proposes a novel flexible and reliable battery management method based on the battery big data platform and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology. First of all, to integrate the battery big data resources in the cloud, a Cyber-physical battery management framework is defined and served as the basic data platform for battery modeling issues. And to improve the quality of the collected battery data in the database, this work reports the first attempt to develop an adaptive data cleaning method for the cloud battery management issue. Furthermore, a deep learning algorithm-based feature extraction model, as well as a feature-oriented battery modeling method, is developed to mitigate the under-fitting problem and improve the accuracy of the cloud-based battery model. The actual operation data of electric buses is used to validate the proposed methodologies. The maximum data restoring error can be limited within 1.3% in the experiments, which indicates that the proposed data cleaning method is able to improve the cloud battery data quality effectively. Meanwhile, the maximum SoC estimation error in the proposed feature-oriented battery modeling method is within 2.47%, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2022-06-10 02:11:05","2022-07-31 14:44:04","","","","","33","","Journal of Energy Storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2020.102064","Big data; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Information management; Embedded systems; Battery management systems; Electric vehicles; Cyber Physical System; Secondary batteries; System-on-chip; Battery energy storage; Cyber-physical battery management system; MODEL; ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; STATE; POWER; CHARGE ESTIMATION; DATA ANALYTICS; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; INTEGRATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key idea is to estimate intractable proposal densities via meta-inference: additional Monte Carlo or variational inference targeting the proposal, rather than the model. RAVI generalizes and unifies several existing methods for inference with expressive approximating families, which we show correspond to specific choices of meta-inference algorithm, and provides new theory for analyzing their bias and variance.

It also decreases the quantity of line loss incurred in Smart Grid (SG). But, uncertainities in demand and supply of the electricity might lead to instability in P2P market for both prosumer and consumer. In recent times, numerous Machine Learning (ML)-enabled load predictive techniques have been developed, while most of the existing studies did not consider its implicit features, optimal parameter selection, and prediction stability. In order to overcome fulfill this research gap, the current research paper presents a new Multi-Objective Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (MOGOA) with Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM)-based short-term load predictive technique i.e., MOGOA-DELM model for P2P Energy Trading (ET) in SGs. The proposed MOGOA-DELM model involves four distinct stages of operations namely, data cleaning, Feature Selection (FS), prediction, and parameter optimization. In addition, MOGOA-based FS technique is utilized in the selection of optimum subset of features. Besides, DELM-based predictive model is also applied in forecasting the load requirements. The proposed MOGOA model is also applied in FS and the selection of optimal DELM parameters to improve the predictive outcome. To inspect the effectual outcome of the proposed MOGOA-DELM model, a series of simulations was performed using UK Smart Meter dataset. In the experimentation procedure, the proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.80% and the results established the superiority of the proposed model in predicting the testing data.  2021 Tech Science Press.

Among various contributing factors to the runway overrun incident, long landing plays an important role. However, existing studies for long landing prediction mainly depend on classic machine learning methods and handcrafted features. As a result, they usually require much expert knowledge and provide unsatisfactory results. To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative deep sequence-to-sequence model which utilizes QAR (Quick Access Recorder) data for accurate long landing pre- diction. Specifically, to cope with the high heterogeneity of QAR dataset, a data pre-processing procedure is first proposed which includes data cleaning, interpolation and normalization steps. Second, to avoid the noises incurred by too many QAR parameters and relieve the reliance on expert experience, the GBDT (gradient boosting decision trees) model is employed to choose the most relevant parameters as features. Then a CNN-LSTM and TG-attention encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to accurately predict future aircraft ground speed and radio height sequences, based on which the touchdown distance can be finally calculated.

In this study, an efficient heart disease prediction is developed based on optimal feature selection. Initially, the data pre-processing process is performed using data cleaning, data transformation, missing values imputation, and data normalisation. Then the decision function-based chaotic salp swarm (DFCSS) algorithm is used to select the optimal features in the feature selection process. Then the chosen attributes are given to the improved Elman neural network (IENN) for data classification. Here, the sailfish optimisation (SFO) algorithm is used to compute the optimal weight value of IENN. The combination of DFCSS-IENN-based SFO (IESFO) algorithm effectively predicts heart disease. The proposed (DFCSS-IESFO) approach is implemented in the Python environment using two different datasets such as the University of California Irvine (UCI) Cleveland heart disease dataset and CVD dataset. The simulation results proved that the proposed scheme achieved a high-classification accuracy of 98.7% for the CVD dataset and 98% for the UCI dataset compared to other classifiers, such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbour, Elman neural network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree.","2020-12","2022-06-10 02:11:07","2022-07-31 14:03:10","","380-90","","6","14","","IET Systems Biology","","IET Syst.

The problem exists in applications where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial responses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation, classification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing features as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of samples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have missing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is observed for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint from the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient algorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the extended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world hydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature distribution in training samples is multi-modal. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Recently, many researchers have shown interest in MRC, for which a considerable number of datasets are being released. Datasets for MRC, which are composed of the context-query-answer triple, are designed to answer a given query by referencing and understanding a readily-available, relevant context text. The TriviaQA dataset is a weakly labeled dataset, because it contains irrelevant context that forms no basis for answering the query. The existing syntactic data cleaning method struggles to deal with the contextual noise this irrelevancy creates. Therefore, a semantic data cleaning method using reasoning processes is necessary. To address this, we propose a new MRC model in which the TriviaQA dataset is validated and trained using a high-quality dataset. The data validation method in our MRC model improves the quality of the training dataset, and the answer extraction model learns with the validated training data, because of our validation method. Our proposed method showed a 4.33% improvement in performance for the TriviaQA Wiki, compared to the existing baseline model. Accordingly, our proposed method can address the limitation of irrelevant context in MRC better than the human supervision.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:08","2022-07-31 05:58:05","","5667-77","","","8","","IEEE Access","","IEEE Access (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: IEEE","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963569","Artificial intelligence; Neural networks; data handling; learning (artificial intelligence); Query processing; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; natural language processing; query processing; text analysis; language translation; question answering (information retrieval)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, UAV images crowned with small-sized, highly dense, and overlapping spikes cause the accuracy to decrease for detection. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv5 (You Look Only Once)-based method to detect wheat spikes accurately in UAV images and solve spike error detection and miss detection caused by occlusion conditions. The proposed method introduces data cleaning and data augmentation to improve the generalization ability of the detection network. The network is rebuilt by adding a microscale detection layer, setting prior anchor boxes, and adapting the confidence loss function of the detection layer based on the IoU (Intersection over Union). These refinements improve the feature extraction for small-sized wheat spikes and lead to better detection accuracy. With the confidence weights, the detection boxes in multiresolution images are fused to increase the accuracy under occlusion conditions. The result shows that the proposed method is better than the existing object detection algorithms, such as Faster RCNN, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), RetinaNet, and standard YOLOv5. The average accuracy (AP) of wheat spike detection in UAV images is 94.1%, which is 10.8% higher than the standard YOLOv5. Thus, the proposed method is a practical way to handle the spike detection in complex field scenarios and provide technical references for field-level wheat phenotype monitoring.  2021 by the authors.

As the total sleep time is essential to assess the sleep apnea severity, a sleep-wake classifier was developed based on heart rate and respiration. These two signals were selected as they can be measured using unobtrusive sensors. A 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to classify 30s epochs of tachograms and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals. The input based on beat-to-beat variability allows the use of different sensor types. A dataset of 56 patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) below 10 was used to train and validate the network. This CNN was applied to an independent test set of ECG and RIP signals of 25 subjects. Of these, 8 subjects were simultaneously monitored using an unobtrusive capacitive-coupled ECG (ccECG) sensor integrated in a mattress. Artefact removal and data correction was performed on this acquired data. The performance on the independent dataset of ECG and RIP is comparable to state-of-the-art, with ? = 0.48. However, application on the ccECG data resulted in a drop in performance, with ? = 0.30. This was caused by a low amount of remaining wake epochs after data cleaning. Importantly, the network classified 30s segments of sleep apnea patients, without relying on past or future information for feature extraction.  2020 Creative Commons; the authors hold their copyright.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:08","2022-07-31 04:18:58","","","","","2020-September","","","","Computing in Cardiology","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Rimini, Italy","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.22489/CinC.2020.147","Monitoring; Feature extraction; Cardiology; Convolutional neural networks; Biomedical signal processing; Wearable sensors; Electrocardiography; Capacitive sensors; Plethysmography; Sleep research; Wakes; Biomedical monitoring; Sleep apnea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To optimize cost function, most supervised learning algorithms presume that the classes being considered are a similar cardinality and that supposition does not matter to imbalanced datasets in the case of sub-optimal classification results. Consequently, various methods have been proposed that correct imbalanced datasets such as under-sampling, over-sampling, ensemble-based methodologies, and cost-sensitive learning. However, the lack of information triggers the under-sampling and over-sampling to endure higher runtime and potential overfitting. Also, there is a disadvantage for a cost-sensitive method to handle insufficiently specified costs. To solve this issue, a new hybrid HUSCSLBoost framework has been proposed to manipulate imbalanced data through three key steps: data cleaning, data balancing, and cost accumulation. HUSCSLBoost uses Tomek-Link algorithms for eliminating noise data in the first stage and then creates several balanced subsets applying the random under-sampling. Finally, the CSLBoost method involves each balance subsets like any boost iteration, such as RUSBoost. The inclusion of a cost concept into the value update calculation for each case is based on its hardness to minimize the lack of information introduced by undertaking tests. HUSCSBoost was applied to 27 imbalanced datasets, and the outcome is considerably better than the current best-performing RUSBoost method.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2022","2022-06-10 02:11:08","2022-07-31 15:36:52","","423-435","","","869","","","","Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Virtual, Online","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0019-8_32","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Iterative methods; Supervised learning; Cost functions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The friction mechanism of pavement skid resistance was introduced based on the traditional Coulomb friction law, and the factors influencing the skid resistance were summarized based on road surface, tire, and contact environment. The direct and indirect measurement methods of skid resistance were evaluated, and the difficulties of road-surface texture detection and test data preprocessing methods were analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the skid resistance prediction methods, including traditional empirical statistical models, mechanical models, and machine learning, were compared and analyzed. Analysis results show that many factors influence the skid resistance of pavements, and it is difficult to describe the mechanical behavior of the third body between rubber and rough surface. Thus, further investigations are required to reveal the friction mechanism toward the contact interface with the lubrication medium.For the single function and high cost of the direct detection of skid resistance, surface texture detection using automatic high-speed noncontact measurements will be more in line with future intelligent integrated requirements. However, high-precision and large-range detection and data cleaning are still bottlenecks that need to break through. Compared to the existing prediction models, the tire-pavement contact characteristics are weakened by the empirical statistical model and machine learning, resulting in a lack of scalability in the prediction model. The implementation of the finite element simulation model method is expected to reveal the friction mechanism under complex physical fields to develop a more precise and efficient model for predicting the skid resistance of pavements.  2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

ETA predictions are unreliable due to the lack of good quality historical data, while 'live' positions in mobile apps suffer from delays in data transmission. This study uses deep neural networks to predict the next position of a bus under various vehicle-location data-quality regimes. Additionally, we assess the effect of the target representation in the prediction problem by encoding it either as unconstrained geographical coordinates, progress along known trajectory or ETA at the next two stops. We demonstrate that without data cleaning, model predictions give false confidence if mean errors are used, highlighting the importance of a holistic assessment of the results. We show that target representation affects the prediction accuracy, by constraining the prediction space. The literature is vague about quality issues in public transport data. Here we show that noisy data is a problem and discuss simple but effective approaches to address these issues. Research generally only focuses on a single method of target representation. Therefore, comparing several methods is a useful addition to the literature. This gives insight into the value of addressing data quality issues in urban transport data to enable better predictions and improve the passenger experience. We show that 'rephrasing' the prediction problem by changing the target representation can yield massively improved predictions.

Several works have shown that these patterns can be extracted efficiently in an unsupervised way, e.g., using Convolutional Dictionary Learning. This leads to an event-based description of the data. Given these events, a natural question is to estimate how their occurrences are modulated by certain cognitive tasks and experimental manipulations. To address it, we propose a point process approach. While point processes have been used in neuroscience in the past, in particular for single cell recordings (spike trains), techniques such as Convolutional Dictionary Learning make them amenable to human studies based on EEG/MEG signals. We develop a novel statistical point process model  called driven temporal point processes (DriPP)  where the intensity function of the point process model is linked to a set of point processes corresponding to stimulation events. We derive a fast and principled expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. Simulations reveal that model parameters can be identified from long enough signals. Results on standard MEG datasets demonstrate that our methodology reveals event-related neural responses  both evoked and induced  and isolates non-task-specific temporal patterns.

This paper proposes two novel methods for missing data imputation, named kEMI and kEMI+, that are based on the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for pre-imputation and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for posterior-imputation. The former is a local search mechanism that aims to automatically find the best value for k and the latter makes use of the best k nearest neighbours to estimate missing scores by learning global similarities. kEMI+ makes use of a novel information fusion mechanism. It fuses top estimations through the Dempster-Shafer fusion module to obtain the final estimation. They handle both numerical and categorical features. The performance of the proposed imputation techniques are evaluated by applying them on twenty one publicly available datasets with different missingness and ratios, and, then, compared with other state-of-the-art missing data imputation techniques in terms of standard evaluation measures such as the normalized root mean square difference and the absolute error. The attained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed novel missing data imputation techniques.

X-ray examination is the main means to diagnose this disease. Computer-aided diagnosis of pneumothorax on chest X-ray, as a prerequisite for a timely cure, has been widely studied, but it is still not satisfactory to achieve highly accurate results. In this paper, an image classification algorithm based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for high-resolution medical image analysis of pneumothorax X-rays, which features a Network In Network (NIN) for cleaning the data, random histogram equalization data augmentation processing, and a DCNN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively increase the correct diagnosis rate of pneumothorax, and the Area under Curve (AUC) of the test verified in the experiment is 0.9844 on ZJU-2 test data and 0.9906 on the ChestX-ray14, respectively. In addition, a large number of atmospheric pleura samples are visualized and analyzed based on the experimental results and in-depth learning characteristics of the algorithm. The analysis results verify the validity of feature extraction for the network. Combined with the results of these two aspects, the proposed X-ray image processing algorithm can effectively improve the classification accuracy of pneumothorax photographs.","2021","2022-06-10 02:11:10","2022-07-31 13:59:14","","951-62","","3","18","","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","","IEEE/ACM Trans.

This method introduces an autoregressive exogenous model and fuzzy neural network to explore the underlying distribution characteristics of wind power systems by correlation analysis of the linear and nonlinear information contained in time-series data of the wind power system. In addition, in order to eliminate outliers in the original data set, an abnormal data cleaning approach combining quartile and two-stage clustering algorithm is employed to reduce the computation time and improve the model accuracy.

Training and validation dataset collection are required for a disease in each digestive organ under a similar image capture condition; this is the first step in system development. This data cleansing task in data collection causes a great burden among experienced endoscopists. Thus, this study classified upper gastrointestinal (GI) organ images obtained via routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) into precise anatomical categories using AlexNet. Method: In total, 85,246 raw upper GI endoscopic images from 441 patients with gastric cancer were collected retrospectively. The images were manually classified into 14 categories: 0) white-light (WL) stomach with indigo carmine (IC); 1) WL esophagus with iodine; 2) narrow-band (NB) esophagus; 3) NB stomach with IC; 4) NB stomach; 5) WL duodenum; 6) WL esophagus; 7) WL stomach; 8) NB oralpharynxlarynx; 9) WL oralpharynxlarynx; 10) WL scaling paper; 11) specimens; 12) WL muscle fibers during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); and 13) others. AlexNet is a deep learning framework and was trained using 49,174 datasets and validated using 36,072 independent datasets. Results: The accuracy rates of the training and validation dataset were 0.993 and 0.965, respectively. Conclusions: A simple anatomical organ classifier using AlexNet was developed and found to be effective in data cleansing task for collection of EGD images.

It brings the opportunity to use universal big data for further computation that may deliver new insights and automation system. The technology that enables this work is artificial intelligence (AI). As known, the utilization of AI technology is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily life. Furthermore, discussion related to AI has played an essential role in an organization's decision-making process. Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-to-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth. The end-to-end process begins with data collection covering various types of data (text, picture, audio, video, animation) and various methods (survey, observation, interview, experiment). Then, it continues with the pre-process data cleansing and process to determine data features, and seeks the relationship within them, using machine learning process with appropriate algorithms. The results may then be used for applications portfolio in order to improve organization strategies and programs. The organization's performance can be visualized from time to time for continuous quality improvement. The end-to-end cycles of processes continue, from data collection, data pre-processing and processing, performance computation monitoring (identification, classification, prediction, and prescription), improving strategy and program, and implementing in the real-life activities until generating more behavioral data, finding pattern and design the systems. As a whole, this end-to-end cycle leads us to an AI automation system, with the power to generate meaningful insights suited to solve current problems, predicting trending issues, and understanding phenomena.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:11","2022-07-31 03:52:44","","9-18","","","","","","","2020 5th International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security (IWBIS)","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWBIS50925.2020.9255497","Big data; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Automation; neural nets; Artificial intelligence; data analysis; learning (artificial intelligence); Feature extraction; Decision making; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Security of data; Application programs; decision making; Big Data; machine learning; deep learning; big data; Correlation; Classification algorithms; artificial intelligence; AI; automation system; end-to-end cycle processes; finding pattern; ICT; Enterprise resource planning; PERFORMANCE; LOG DATA; NEWS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It plays an important role in data cleansing and integration. Advanced entity matching techniques focus on extracting syntactic or semantic features from record pairs via complex neural architectures or pre-trained language models. However, the performances always suffer from noisy or missing attribute values in the records. We observe that comparing one record with several relevant records in a collective manner allows each pairwise matching decision to be made by borrowing valuable insights from other pairs, which is beneficial to the overall matching performance. In this paper, we propose a generic one-to-set neural framework named GNEM for entity matching. GNEM predicts matching labels between one record and a set of relevant records simultaneously.

We further show that GNEM can be interpreted as an extension and generalization of the existing pairwise matching techniques. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that GNEM consistently outperforms the existing pairwise entity matching techniques and achieves up to 8.4% improvement on F1-Score compared with the state-of-the-art neural methods.","2021-04-19","2022-06-10 02:11:11","2022-07-31 13:37:45","","1686-94","","","","","","","WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3450119","Deep learning; neural nets; data analysis; Data Analytics; Semantics; World Wide Web; feature extraction; pattern matching; data integration; graph theory; Deep learning, Graph neural network, Entity matching; Graph structures; RULE-BASED METHOD; Entity matching; Graph neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since Microblogging sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc. provides an easyand short way to express and share their view of millions of users daily. With increase of use of the microblogs people express their opinions on variety of topics, companies, products etc. These helps a lot for the company to propagate their business by analyzing peoples opinion. The intention of this paper is to develop a model that analyzes the sentiment behind the tweets gathered from the Twitter. The challenge is the data that are there in Twitter are extremely unformed which makes difficult to study. In our model, the sentiment analysis process is as follows: (1) Collect tweets directly using Twitter API, (2) Data Cleaning, (3) Training the data into our model i.e. Naive Bayes, (4) Extracted tweets are classified by its sentiment i.e. its polarity (positive, negative or neutral).

If there is no good translation mechanism for such a widely used language, it will bring trouble to both study and life. At present, the world's major platforms are committed to the study of English translation strategies. There are translation platforms from different regions and different translation mechanisms. These translation data from different translation platforms have the characteristics of large-scale, multisource, heterogeneity, high dimensions, and poor quality. However, such inconsistent translation data will increase the translation difficulty and translation time. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of translation data to achieve a better translation effect. How to provide a large-scale and efficient translation strategy needs to integrate the translation strategies of various platforms to perform heterogeneous translation data cleaning and fusion based on machine learning. At first, this paper represents the multisource, heterogeneous translation data model as tree-augmented naive Bayes networks (TANs) and naturally captures the relationship between the datasets through the learning of TANs structure and the probability distribution of input attributes and tuples, using data probability value to complete the classification of translation data cleaning. Then, a multisource, heterogeneous translation data fusion model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed, and RNN is used to control the node data of hidden layer to enhance the fault-tolerant ability in the fusion process and complete the construction of fusion model. Finally, experimental results show that TANs-based translation data cleaning method can effectively improve the cleaning rate with an average improvement of approximately 10% and cleaning time with an average reduce about 5%. In addition, RNN-based multisource translation data fusion method improves the shortcomings of the traditional fusion model and improves the practicability of the fusion model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), fusion time, and integrity.  2022 Hindawi Limited.

These datasets are not meant to serve as repositories for signature-based detection systems, but rather to promote research on anomaly-based detection through various machine learning approaches. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 contains about 16,000,000 instances collected over the course of ten days. It is the most recent intrusion detection dataset that is big data, publicly available, and covers a wide range of attack types. This multi-class dataset has a class imbalance, with roughly 17% of the instances comprising attack (anomalous) traffic. Our survey work contributes several key findings. We determined that the best performance scores for each study, where available, were unexpectedly high overall, which may be due to overfitting. We also found that most of the works did not address class imbalance, the effects of which can bias results in a big data study. Lastly, we discovered that information on the data cleaning of CSE-CIC-IDS2018 was inadequate across the board, a finding that may indicate problems with reproducibility of experiments.

This is critical in high-impact applications such as data cleaning and user stitching. The state-of-the-art entity linkage pipelines mainly depend on supervised learning that requires abundant amounts of training data. However, collecting well-labeled training data becomes expensive when the data from many sources arrives incrementally over time. Moreover, the trained models can easily overfit to specific data sources, and thus fail to generalize to new sources due to significant differences in data and label distributions. To address these challenges, we present AdaMEL, a deep transfer learning framework that learns generic high-level knowledge to perform multi-source entity linkage. AdaMEL models the attribute importance that is used to match entities through an attribute-level self-attention mechanism, and leverages the massive unlabeled data from new data sources through domain adaptation to make it generic and data-source agnostic. In addition, AdaMEL is capable of incorporating an additional set of labeled data to more accurately integrate data sources with different attribute importance. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results with 8.21% improvement on average over methods based on supervised learning. Besides, it is more stable in handling different sets of data sources in less runtime. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

The current cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures, as well as modern edge computing systems especially in the 5G and beyond networks, can be addressed to resolve these challenges. However, there are several application areas especially in vehicular and urban computing, where just harnessing more computational power does not solve computational and real-time requirements of the modern sensing systems that operate in mobile and context-dependent environments. For now, the mathematical challenges of distributed computing and real-time learning algorithms have not been profoundly addressed in the context of the IoT and real-world sensing applications.

In existing medical data classification methods, initially, the medical data pre-processing is performed. After pre-processing feature selection is performed, otherwise, the process is more time consuming and has poor accuracy. Here we have proposed two algorithms for enhancing the classification performance on medical data. In first proposed method Bag of Words technique is used for better feature subset selection. Subsequently, the hybrid Fuzzy-Neural Network approach used that can handle imprecision in data while classification. This combination of feature selection technique and Fuzzy-Neural Network classifier approach gives enhanced classification accuracy. In the second proposed algorithm, we have integrated data cleaning technique to improve data quality as pre-processing technique along with bag of words and Fuzzy-Neural Network, this method performs classification on clean filtered data with appropriately reduced feature set that results in more accurate classification than the existing methods. Thus in proposed approaches we have tried to handle three issues, removing noise in data, optimal feature subset selection and handling imprecision in data. The comparative study of various medical datasets in terms of accuracy shows that the two proposed algorithms perform better as compared to existing techniques and the enhancement obtained is around 3% and 17% respectively.

It trains a binary classifier using features such as historical update frequency and existence time of a fact to compute the likelihood of a fact in a KB to be outdated. Then, it interacts with humans to verify whether a fact with high likelihood is indeed outdated. In addition, it also uses logical rules to detect more outdated facts based on human feedback. The outdated facts detected by the logical rules will also be fed back to train the ML model further for data augmentation.

In a typical data-analysis pipeline, data cleaning is the most cost-intensive, laborious, and time-consuming step. Unclean dataset or partially cleaned dataset can lead to incorrect training of machine learning models and result in wrong conclusions. Generally, data-scientists examine null, missing, or duplicate values, and the dataset is cleaned by removing the entire record or imputing the values. However, deleting the records, or imputing the values cannot be termed as comprehensive cleaning, as these cleaning techniques may result in a reduction in the population of data, and increased error in estimation due to biased values. For systematically cleaning an unclean dataset, it is necessary to comply with the data quality dimensions such as completeness, validity, consistency, accuracy, and conformity. The errors described as violations of expectations for completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency and other dimensions of data quality often impede the successful completion of information processing streams and consequently degrade the dependent business processes. Therefore, educating a data-scientist for comprehensively cleaning a raw-dataset acquired for analysis is an incremental learning process. Moreover, for extensive training on cleaning a dataset on different quality dimensions, it is necessary to provide a variety of datasets that are unclean on various data quality dimensions. Hence, in this paper, we present DWreck, a data wrecker framework for generating unclean datasets by counterproductively applying different data quality dimensions. The DWreck framework is designed on the principles of microservices architecture pattern. For allowing function-specific extensibility, the DWreck comprises four groups of microservices: (a) Dataset Profiling, (b) Data type Processing, (c) Counterproductive Dimensions, and (d) Miscellaneous. The orchestrator coordinates the different microservices in a complex workflow that is further split into three sub-workflows to generate an unclean (wrecked) dataset as an output. Finally, we evaluate the DWreck framework on twenty seed-datasets to generate corresponding wrecked datasets.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:13","2022-07-31 14:05:49","","78-87","","","","","","","2020 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService).

On-site meteorological information, such as solar irradiance, is helpful for monitoring PV systems. However, collecting this type of weather data at every station is not feasible for a fleet owing to the limitation of installation costs. In this study, to monitor a PV fleet efficiently, neighboring PV generation profiles were utilized for fault detection and imputation, as well as solar irradiance. For fault detection from unlabeled raw PV data, K-means clustering was employed to detect abnormal patterns based on customized input features, which were extracted from the fleet PVs and weather data. When a profile was determined to have an abnormal pattern, imputation for the corresponding data was implemented using the subset of neighboring PV data clustered as normal. For evaluation, the effectiveness of neighboring PV information was investigated using the actual rooftop PV power generation data measured at several locations in the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) campus. The results indicate that neighboring PV profiles improve the fault detection capability and the imputation accuracy. For fault detection, clustering-based schemes provided error rates of 0.0126 and 0.0223, respectively, with and without neighboring PV data, whereas the conventional prediction-based approach showed an error rate of 0.0753. For imputation, estimation accuracy was significantly improved by leveraging the labels of fault detection in the proposed scheme, as much as 18.32% reduction in normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) compared with the conventional scheme without fault consideration.  2020 by the authors.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:13","2022-07-31 14:35:06","","","","3","13","","Energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en13030737","Error detection; Mean square error; K-means clustering; Unsupervised learning; Photovoltaic cells; Fault detection; Meteorology; Solar radiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, rare research has focused on exploring such relationship. Motivated by this, this paper conducts an experimental comparison for the effects of missing, inconsistent, and conflicting data on classification and clustering models. From the experimental results, we observe that dirty-data impacts are related to the error type, the error rate, and the data size.

Numerous data in these disciplines are sequence of observations measured as functions of time, which can be further used for different applications via analytical or data analytics techniques (e.g., to forecast future price, climate change, etc.). However, presence of outliers can cause significant uncertainties to interpretation results; hence, it is essential to remove the outliers accurately and efficiently before conducting any further analysis. A total of 17 techniques that belong to statistical, regression-based, and machine learning (ML) based categories for outlier detection in timeseries are applied to the oil and gas production data analysis. 15 of these methods are utilized for production data analysis for the first time. Two state-of-the-art and high-performance techniques are then selected for data cleaning which require minimum control and time complexity. Moreover, performances of these techniques are evaluated based on several metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa to rank the techniques. Results show that eight unsupervised algorithms outperform the rest of the methods based on the synthetic case study with known outliers. For example, accuracies of the eight shortlisted methods are in the range of 0.830.99 with a precision between 0.83 and 0.98, compared to 0.650.82 and 0.070.77 for the others. In addition, ML-based techniques perform better than statistical techniques. Our experimental results on real field data further indicate that the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Fulford-Blasingame methods are superior to other outlier detection frameworks for outlier detection in production data, followed by four others including density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD). Even though the techniques are examined with oil and gas production data, but the same data cleaning workflow can be used to detect timeseries outliers in other disciplines.  2021","2022","2022-06-10 02:11:14","2022-07-31 04:53:30","","","","","191","","Expert Systems with Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116371","Data handling; Diagnosis; Data Analytics; Statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Uncertainty analysis; Gas industry; Climate change; Outlier detection; Performance evaluation; Binary classification; Decline curve analysis; Production data analysis; ANOMALY DETECTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, Machine learning algorithms have been used in numerous fields and industries and one of the main growing markets is real estate. It is already helping real estate agents to respond more quickly to clients' questions and develop landing pages that fit customers' needs. However, one of the main time-consuming stages for a real estate agent is the process of answering questions about price per location and knowing which locations clients are interested in. In order to solve these problems, we have built a telegram chatbot to answer customers of any real estate agent with the price of a real estate property based on their current Geolocation. This bot can predict the price of a real estate property using room numbers, Geolocation, and surface area in square meters. These are the inputs for machine learning algorithms to give an approximate price. The bot can predict based on the source of the data-set, for example, we have collected our data from classified ads website for real estate in Amman, Jordan. We have used python and web scraping library for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. As a result, by using Geolocation we have increased the model accuracy to 1.3X and our bot can be replicated in any markets based on the dataset. We believe our work can be taken to different markets and make real estate agent's job easy and more profitable by changing leads to potential customers thought answering their questions.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:15","2022-07-31 05:20:31","","012010 (9 pp.)","","","1694","","","","J.

Low Birth Weight (LBW) has become an increasingly common problem, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Therefore, an ability to predict the LBW is beneficial and a good preventive measure. It is also a good indicator of future health risks of that infant. This study is concerned about the implementation of predictive LBW models for rural and urban areas of Afghanistan based on the data obtained from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015. The main objective of the study is to identify the most suitable machine learning techniques (i.e. classifiers) among the five popular ones. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Prior to implementing the predictive models, data preprocessing is carried out. This is done by means of data cleansing and feature selection. The well-known Correlation based Feature Selection algorithm (CFS) is employed to select the top ten attributes. The classifier in this study comprises two categories, Normal and LBW. The preparation of the dataset is carefully done to ensure well-balanced samples in each category. The study reveals that Random Forest is the best classifier with an accuracy of 84.70% and 85.2% and with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 91.0% and 92.1% for both rural and urban areas, respectively.

The research describes the building of a proof-of-concept for an unsupervised data curation process addressing a basic form of data cleansing in the form of identifying redundant records through entity resolution and spelling corrections. The novelty of the approach is to use ER as the first step using an unsupervised blocking and stop word scheme based on token frequency. A scoring matrix is used for linking unstandardized references, and an unsupervised process for evaluating linking results based on cluster entropy. The ER process is iterative, and in each iteration, the match threshold is increased. The prototype was tested on 18 fully-annotated test samples of primarily synthetic person data varied in two different ways, good data quality versus poor data quality, and a single record layout versus two different record layouts. In samples with good data quality and using both single and mixed layouts, the final clusters had an average F-measure of 0.91, precision of 0.96, and recall of 0.87 outcomes comparable to results from a supervised ER process. In samples with poor data quality whether mixed or single layout, the average F-measure was 0.78, precision 0.74, and recall 0.83 showing that data quality assessment and improvement is still a critical component of successful data curation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of building an unsupervised ER engine to support data integration for good quality references while avoiding the time and effort to standardize reference sources to a common layout, design, and test matching rules, design blocking keys, or test blocking alignment. Also, the paper proposes how unsupervised data quality improvement processes could also be incorporated into the design allowing the model to address an even broader range of data curation applications.  2020 Science and Information Organization.

The electricity system is becoming more and more mature, but abnormal electricity consumption behaviors are also emerging endlessly, causing potential safety hazards in the electricity industry and even the electricity supply system. Considering the lack of abnormal annotations in the electricity load data, this paper proposes a semi-supervised electricity load data anomaly detection method based on MixMatch. Firstly, data cleaning of electricity load data is used to remove incorrect data. Secondly, Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is used to extract its time-domain and frequency-domain features separately, and the features are combined through feature fusion. Thirdly, the Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline-SMOTE) is used to solve the problem of data imbalance. The MixMatch semi-supervised algorithm is used to label the abnormal data to realize the anomaly detection of the electricity load data. Finally, this paper uses the k-means clustering and T-Stochastic neighbour Embedding (T -SNE) to classify the abnormal data and visualize the data.

Existing data preparation and integration systems are known to make mistakes that need to be corrected by humans, which is labor-intensive and expensive especially at scale [19], [20], [25], [9], [8]. The accuracy is also known to suffer on dirty data. In this paper we define and evaluate tabular embeddings to help increase the accuracy.Embeddings, is a well-known dimensionality reduction technique, usually applied to represent (one-dimensional) text documents/sentences as vectors for further analytics [28], [7], [23]. Using embeddings lowers dimensionality, as well as the models trained with embeddings often exhibit higher accuracy, compared to the same trained without such, because the embeddings vectors store the context information. Our 2-dimensional embeddings are more suitable for tables rather than text. We justify their efficiency on fundamental tasks on tables such as classifying columns and tuples.We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and compare the Neural Network trained with tabular embeddings against the same trained without such embeddings. We report significant accuracy gains in tuple classification when using the Neural Network trained with our tabular embeddings - up to 17.6% delta in F-measure for Songs compared with the same without our embeddings.

The problem exists in applications where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial responses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation, classification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing features as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of samples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have missing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is observed for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint from the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient algorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the extended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world hydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature distribution in training samples is multi-modal.

Integrating the environment for effective AI machine learning can be regarded as a complicated task and may even consist of several separate tasks, such as building a test environment, data acquisition, data cleansing, machine learning training, and model management. In terms of the cognitive engineering approach, most tasks not only require knowledge-based cognitive control over skill-based or rule-based behaviours higher cognitive loads and workloads as well. Since complex knowledge and higher cognitive loads are required, the use of AI machine learning is limited and leads to ineffective work procedures. Thus, this research analysed the AI development process via various methods of cognitive task analysis in order to identify which tasks induce cognitive workload. Then, a new integrated AI development system was created, which was expected to reduce the number of ineffective tasks and workload. Experiments were conducted twice to validate the systems effectiveness, and the results indicate that there were significant differences between the several different AI development tasks.

However, in many real-world applications where new data (i.e., out-of-samples) in the testing phase can be unseen in the training procedure, (1) RPCA which is a transductive method can be naturally incapable of handing out-of-samples, and (2) violently applying RPCA into this applications does not explicitly consider the relationships between reconstruction error and low-rank representation. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a Double Robust Principal Component Analysis to deal with the out-of-sample problems, which is termed as DRPCA. More specifically, we integrate a reconstruction error into the criterion function of RPCA. Our proposed model can then benefit from (1) the robustness of principal components to outliers and missing values, (2) the bridge between reconstruction error and low-rank representation, (3) low-rank clean data extraction from new datum by a linear transform.

Data-driven techniques can complement existing physics-based approaches for complex problems such as wind farm wake modeling. In this paper, a deep learning model is developed to predict the local short-Term wind characteristics. A data pre-processing pipeline that includes data cleaning and normalizing steps is developed to generate the training dataset. Time-series forecasting models based on long-short-Term-memory (LSTM) and convLSTM are developed and trained for local short-Term wind forecasting. The model is validated through experiments on three-year data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) database.

The R2 values for predicting 1-minute, 30-minute, and 1 hour, wind characteristics for both LSTM and convLSTM were above 0.92. The results are in agreement with the literature.

We propose that this lead bias can be leveraged in our favor in a simple and effective way to pre-train abstractive news summarization models on large-scale unlabeled news corpora: predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an article. We collect a massive news corpus and conduct data cleaning and filtering via statistical analysis.

However, the openness of the mariculture environment makes the variation of water quality nonlinear, dynamic and complex. Traditional methods face challenges in prediction accuracy and generalization performance. To address these problems, an accurate water quality prediction scheme is proposed for pH, water temperature and dissolved oxygen. First, we construct a new huge raw data set collected in time series consisting of 23,204 groups of data. Then, the water quality parameters are preprocessed for data cleaning successively through threshold processing, mean proximity method, wavelet filter, and improved smoothing method. Next, the correlation between the water quality to be predicted and other dynamics parameters is revealed by the Pearson correlation coefficient method. Meanwhile, the data for training is weighted by the discovered correlation coefficients. Finally, by adding a backward SRU node to the training sequence, which can be integrated into the future context information, the deep Bi-S-SRU (Bi-directional Stacked Simple Recurrent Unit) learning network is proposed. After training, the prediction model can be obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed prediction method achieve higher prediction accuracy than the method based on RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with similar or less time computing complexity.

For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. In this initial study we focus mainly on brain MRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing state-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging patients (BA \not ≈ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that the remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients. A statistical and visualization-based analysis has provided evidence regarding the potential and current challenges of the proposed methodology.","2021-07","2022-06-10 02:27:01","2022-07-31 02:11:22","","1778-1791","","7","40","","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3066857","Deterioration; Iterative methods; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Medical imaging; Population statistics; Estimation; deep learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Aging; Biological age estimation; Biological systems; Biomedical imaging; chronological age; Genetics; magnetic resonance imaging; Three-dimensional displays; Aluminum compounds; III-V semiconductors; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owning to their large size, only slide-level labels or a handful of coarse annotations are usually provided for pathology images, which makes the training of the classifier challenging. In this study, we propose a conceptually simple, two-stage approach to classify small and large duct types in intrahepatic chalongio-carcinoma using only slide-level labels. Unlike conventional pathology image analysis methods employ multiple instance learning (MIL) applied to overcome the problem of the slide-level label, we introduce a novel label smoothing method to progressively refine the training labels to improve the classification accuracy. The main idea is that we introduce the hidden class, which is assumed to be mutually inclusive of all ground-truth classes and less confident for classification. By iteratively refining (i.e., smoothing) per-patch labels, we can extract and discard the hidden class from the training data. We demonstrate that the proposed label filtering scheme improves the classification accuracy by up to 30% compared to the baseline MIL method and 10% compared to the state-of-the-art noisy label cleaning method. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gene mutation prior information in the classification of two different duct types. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method may provide pathologists insight into the study of correlations between genetic and histologic subtypes.","2021-04-13","2022-06-10 02:27:02","2022-07-31 03:18:28","","1944-1948","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434095","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Pathology; Training; Training data; Smoothing methods; Biological system modeling; Image enhancement; Refining; Ducts; duct type; hidden class detection; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; multiple instance learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Sampling technology has been widely used in big data context. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Hence this article focuses on researching sampling for data profiling tasks in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.","2020","2022-06-10 02:27:03","2022-07-31 04:28:42","","72713-72726","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988120","Anomaly detection; Big data; Data handling; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Digital storage; Data mining; Metadata; Big Data; Task analysis; Systematics; data profiling; large amount; Relational databases; sampling; Sampling methods; Importance sampling; DISCOVERY; DEPENDENCIES; DISTANCE THRESHOLDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If we can build a model based on historical data features to predict the deployment of equipment and personnel in key areas, we can preempt and gain an advantage on the battlefield. A frequency-driven temporal convolution network TFCN (Frequency-Temporal Convolution Network) is introduced based on the theoretical framework of deep learning and combining the time and frequency domain features of data in the traditional digital signal processing field. Inspired by Shannon&amp;#x2019;s sampling theorem, to achieve the purpose of fast learning of time series data features, it is necessary to satisfy the sampling frequency greater than twice the frequency of the principal components of time series data, ie., to ensure that the network structure and parameters sample the features-within at least one-half of the main period of the data, and then optimize the division of the data set and the design of the network structure. In this paper, -we standardize the time series data after data cleaning, and demonstrate that the above process does not affect the frequency distribution of the original data. We build the model to achieve prediction and evaluation, and the experiment result indicates that the TFCN we proposed can learn the characteristics of time series data faster than DNN, LSTM and other models, its loss curve can converge faster, and the prediction results are more accurate.","2021-10-22","2022-06-10 02:27:03","2022-07-31 03:57:54","","4571-4577","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAC53003.2021.9728354","Deep learning; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Data mining; Convolution; Time series; Time series analysis; Time domain analysis; Frequency domain analysis; Predictive models; Prediction algorithms; Data Mining; Signal processing algorithms; Frequency-Temporal Convolutional Network; Intelligence Collection; Time-frequency analysis; Curve fitting; Digital signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clarity of vehicular data for efficient decision making is vital in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Huge volumes of vehicular data are collected and processed during vehicular transactions. Pre-processing the huge amounts of raw vehicular data followed by framing effective traffic rules to take appropriate rapid decisions by the ITS on the vehicles continues to be a challenging problem. Most of the current studies done on ITS have proposed decision making strategies to handle only specific vehicular events and many lacked framing intelligent dynamic decision rules along with appropriate actions, representing all traffic events prevailing in the vehicular environment. This study proposes a versatile decision engine implanted with a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, we propose a novel data cleaning algorithm to identify and remove dirty data from the voluminous vehicular dataset. In the second stage, a unique rule framing mechanism is suggested to frame dynamic traffic rules along with their actions using real-time vehicular data. The vehicular entities take suitable decisions to respond to the traffic events based on these rules and their associated actions. A new Naïve Bayesian classifier is proposed in this study to test the new rule framed with the trained rules set, either to accept or reject the new rule for further processing. The algorithms are developed and implemented using machine learning concepts. Experimental and comparative analysis was carried out with other related referred studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Although the proposed decision engine is generic enough for decision making in most ITS use-cases, discussion in this article elaborates on its applicability in use-cases provisioning trust management.","2020","2022-06-10 02:27:04","2022-07-31 14:05:29","","72757-72767","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987414","Cleaning; Machine learning; Decision making; Statistical tests; Intelligent systems; Behavioral research; Engines; Dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Task analysis; data pre-processing; artificial intelligence; rule framing; trust management; Vehicle dynamics; Vehicular networks; Acceptance tests; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; ALGORITHM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We firstly perform the data cleaning and preprocessing of the data and then analyze the dataset to extract the network and statistical features set for different types of IoT devices.

The complicated production process of steel products makes it difficult to find the causes of surplus materials. In this work, we propose a surplus material prediction problem and solve it based on statistical analysis and machine learning methods. In the concerned problem, we predict whether there are surplus materials under a given group of production parameters. The dataset used in this work is from a real-world three-month steel coil production process. First, data cleaning is conducted to standardize the industrial dataset. Then, the production parameters highly correlated with surplus material prediction results are selected by a series of feature selection methods. Finally, two prediction models based on extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression are presented according to the selected features. The experimental results reveal that the proposed prediction models have similar effectiveness.

However, due to the influence of abnormal data and power-limited data, the power curve built directly on the original data will greatly deviate from the normal power curve, resulting in huge errors in actual use. The traditional approach is to clean the wind speed-power data before fitting the power curve, but the data cleaning algorithm is often inefficient and prone to over-cleaning.

This causes penetrations and voltage surges, system instability, inefficient utilities planning and financial loss. Forecast models can help; however, time stamp, forecast horizon, input correlation analysis, data pre and post-processing, weather classification, network optimization, uncertainty quantification and performance evaluations need consideration. Thus, contemporary forecasting techniques are reviewed and evaluated. Input correlational analyses reveal that solar irradiance is most correlated with Photovoltaic output, and so, weather classification and cloud motion study are crucial. Moreover, the best data cleansing processes: normalization and wavelet transforms, and augmentation using generative adversarial network are recommended for network training and forecasting. Furthermore, optimization of inputs and network parameters, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is emphasized. Next, established performance evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE are discussed, with suggestions for including economic utility metrics. Subsequently, modelling approaches are critiqued, objectively compared and categorized into physical, statistical, artificial intelligence, ensemble and hybrid approaches. It is determined that ensembles of artificial neural networks are best for forecasting short term photovoltaic power forecast and online sequential extreme learning machine superb for adaptive networks; while Bootstrap technique optimum for estimating uncertainty. Additionally, convolutional neural network is found to excel in eliciting a model's deep underlying non-linear input-output relationships.

However, industry accepted practices for effectively managing the information that these systems provide have not been widely established yet. This paper presents a four-step methodological framework for the effective data management of SHM systems of OWTs and illustrates its applicability in real-time continuous data collected from three operational units, with the aim of utilising more complete and accurate datasets for fatigue life assessment of support structures. Firstly, a time-efficient synchronisation method that enables the continuous monitoring of these systems is presented, followed by a novel approach to noise cleansing and the posterior missing data imputation (MDI). By the implementation of these techniques those data-points containing excessive noise are removed from the dataset (Step 2), advanced numerical tools are employed to regenerate missing data (Step 3) and fatigue is estimated for the results of these two methodologies (Step 4). Results show that after cleansing, missing data can be imputed with an average absolute error of 2.1%, while this error is kept within the [+ 15.2%−11.0%] range in 95% of cases. Furthermore, only 0.15% of the imputed data fell outside the noise thresholds. Fatigue is found to be underestimated both, when data cleansing does not take place and when it takes place but MDI does not. This makes this novel methodology an enhancement to conventional structural integrity assessment techniques that do not employ continuous datasets in their analyses.","2019-02-01","2022-06-10 03:07:29","2022-07-31 03:12:02","","867-883","","","173","","Ocean Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.01.003","Neural networks; Information management; Condition monitoring; Structural health monitoring; Real time systems; Offshore oil well production; Artificial neural network (ANN); Data synchronisation; Missing data imputation; Noise cleansing; Offshore wind; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Continuous time systems; Fatigue of materials; Ground supports; Offshore wind turbines; Structural integrity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.","2020-09-01","2022-06-10 03:07:29","2022-07-30 20:20:17","","105658","","","144","","Accident Analysis & Prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105658","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information management; Advanced traffic management systems; Costs; Logistic regression; Vehicles; Real time systems; Accidents; Traffic control; Connected vehicle emulated data; Real-time crash potential prediction; Urban arterials; Speed control; MACHINE; FREEWAYS; INJURY SEVERITY; RISK PREDICTION; SHANGHAI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are caused mainly due to off-nominal conditions, catastrophic events, and major failures, resulting in downtime conditions. An accurate and timely detection of downtime events provides crucial information for planning and decision-making. This study investigates the utility of wind power and wind speed as potential parameters for real-time downtime detection. Early and accurate detection of these anomalies using system outputs collected from monitoring stations is challenging and involved, especially when attempted in real-time. In this article, a real-time downtime detection framework is proposed that maps system outputs to turbine events - faults, scheduled, and unplanned maintenance - through online condition indicators. Without imposing strong distributional assumptions, using available training samples, an optimal, cost-sensitive real-time anomaly detection framework is proposed to determine whether a sample is anomalous. Considering the trade-off between misclassification errors and detection rates, detection studies are performed using wind power and speed - calibrated against available alarm classifiers - obtained from two Irish wind farms. The data cleaning and formatting for analysis was automated and subjected to classification with several levels of complexity. Recursive condition indicators (RCIs) such as Recursive Mahalanobis distance (RMD) and Recursive Residual Error (RRE) are chosen as features for classification. The real-time detection model becomes particularly useful when it is prohibitive to identify in advance the anomalies without a baseline of the system behaviour under such conditions. Case studies involving Irish wind Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data demonstrate the successful application of the proposed work for early and accurate downtime detection with comparison to a reference machine learning approach.","2021-12-01","2022-06-10 03:07:31","2022-07-31 15:36:18","","1969-1989","","","179","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.07.139","Anomaly detection; Wind power; Wind turbines; Decision making; Maintenance; Data acquisition; Economic and social effects; Real time systems; Downtime detection; Dynamic systems; Eigen perturbation; Real-time; Wind turbine; Dynamical systems; DIAGNOSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, establishing farming actions on the crop requires analyzing variables such as temperature, ambient humidity, soil moisture, solar irradiance, and Rainfall. Although these signals might contain valuable information, it is vital to mix up the monitored signals and analyze them as a whole to provide more accurate information than analyzing the signals separately. Unfortunately, monitoring all these variables results in high costs. Hence it is necessary to establish an appropriate method that allows the infer variables behavior without the direct measurement of all of them. This paper introduces a multi-sensor data fusion technique, based on a sparse representation, to find the most straightforward and complete linear equation to predict and understand a particular variable behavior based on other monitored environmental variables measurements. Moreover, this approach aims to provide an interpretable model that allows understanding how these variables are combined to achieve such results. The fusion strategy explained in this manuscript follows a four-step process that includes 1. data cleaning, 2. redundant variable detection, 3. dictionary generation, and 4. sparse regression. The algorithm requires a target variable and two highly correlated signals. It is essential to point out that the developed method has no restrictions to specific variables. Consequently, it is possible to replicate this method for the semiautomatic prediction of multiple critical environmental variables. As a case study, this work used the SML2010 data set of the UCI machine learning repository to predicted the humidity's derivative trend function with an error rate lower than 17% and a mean absolute error lower than 6%. The experiment results show that even though sparse model predictions might not be the most accurate compared to those of linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) since it is not a black-box model, it guarantees greater interpretability of the problem.","2022-06-01","2022-06-10 03:07:31","2022-07-31 03:09:31","","171-183","","2","9","","Information Processing in Agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inpa.2021.06.007","Learning systems; Support vector machines; Forecasting; Support vector regression; Agricultural robots; Precision agriculture; Sensor data fusion; Humidity; Inference of variables; Multi-sensor data fusion; Sparse representation; Soil moisture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","2020-09-01","2022-06-10 03:07:31","2022-07-31 05:57:24","","103793","","","94","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Global positioning system; Automation; Learning systems; Ships; Air quality; Time series; Data cleaning; AIS; CRBM; Emission modeling; GPS; Ship time series","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.","2020-11-10","2022-06-10 03:07:32","2022-07-31 01:44:11","","123142","","","273","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123142","Big data; Deep learning; Quality control; Digital storage; Information management; Security of data; Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Smart city; Land use; Urban planning; Social media data; Urban landscape sustainability; Tourism; CHINA; AIR-QUALITY; COMMUTING PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GOOGLE STREET VIEW; LAND; MOBILITY INFORMATION; SMART CITY; SOCIAL-MEDIA DATA; TAXI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Politically and socially, increased demands regarding sustainability and resource consumption are streaming into the focus of companies. One solution strategy to increase the productivity of existing production systems while ensuring existing quality standards is the application of data-driven analytical methods such as machine learning. Due to the frequent changes in production conditions, the analysis of real manufacturing data is linked to sophisticated data pre-processing. Changes in production data are manifested in trends and systematic shifts over time. Data pre-processing includes rule-based data cleaning, the application of dimension reduction techniques and the identification of comparable data subsets. Within the used dataset of hydraulic valves by Bosch, the comparability of the same production conditions in the manufacturing of hydraulic valves can be identified within certain periods. Machine learning methods can process large amounts of data, unfavorable row-column ratios and discover dependencies between the input data and the specified target variable as well as evaluate the multidimensional influence of all input variables on the target variable. For use cases in manufacturing, neural networks, support vector machines and tree-based methods have so far proved to be very successful. The use of cross-process production data along the value chain of hydraulic valves is a promising approach to predict the quality characteristics of workpieces. Within this research, machine learning methods with deep and shallow structures are applied to predict the internal leakage of hydraulic valves based on geometric gauge blocks from machining, mating data from assembly and hydraulic measurement data from end-of-line testing. Moreover, the most suitable methods are selected, and accurate quality predictions are obtained.","2022-01-01","2022-06-10 03:07:32","2022-07-31 05:20:01","","320-325","","","107","","Procedia CIRP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.04.052","Machine Learning; Supervised Learning; Hydraulic Testing; Predictive Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the current tobacco curing control technology has higher labor intensity, however, it also cannot be adjusted based on the conditions of different tobacco leaves batches reducing the quality of tobacco. The tobacco's quality can be improved after curing and labor intensity can be reduced by modeling the state prediction of the tobacco curing process, accurately predicting the state of the tobacco curing, and making timely adjustments to the curing process. The area, color, weight, and some chemical substances of tobacco leaves significantly change during the tobacco curing process. This can be theoretically used as the input feature of the state prediction model. However, it is difficult to calculate the changes of the area and the changes of chemical substances in real-time owing to the complexity of the intensive curing room environment. Only features such as color and weight are easier to extract indicating that the model has fewer available features, and the accuracy of prediction using a single model is relatively low. Considering this problem, a state prediction fusion model (SPFM) was proposed integrating Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). At the same time, based on the characteristics of the data set, a new data processing is proposed for the tobacco curing data set. By denoising, the image, the characteristic values of the RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space were extracted. Then, the data pre-processing such as standardization, data cleaning, and label digitization were performed on the data. Furthermore, an intelligent tobacco curing platform was designed to integrate data collection, online monitoring, data mining, and status prediction, and SPFM was embedded in the platform.

Maintenance is one of the important activities in the manufacturing process, and it requires proper attention. To decrease maintenance costs and to attain sustainable operational management, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) has become important in industries. The principle of PdM is forecasting the next failure; thus, the respective maintenance is scheduled before the predicted failure occurs. In the construction of maintenance management, facility managers generally employ reactive or preventive maintenance mechanisms. However, reactive maintenance does not have the ability to prevent failure and preventive maintenance does not have the ability to predict the future condition of mechanical, electrical, or plumbing components. Therefore, to improve the facilities' lifespans, such components are repaired in advance. In this paper, a PdM planning model is developed using intelligent methods. The developed method involves five main phases: (a) data cleaning, (b) data normalization, (c) optimal feature selection, (d) prediction network decision-making, and (e) prediction. Initially, the data pertaining to PdM are subjected to data cleaning and normalization in order to arrange the data within a particular limit. Optimal feature selection is performed next, to reduce redundant information. Optimal feature selection is performed using a hybrid of the Jaya algorithm and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). As the prediction values differ in range, it is difficult for machine learning or deep learning face to provide accurate results. Thus, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to make decisions regarding the prediction network. The SVM identifies the network in which prediction can be performed for the concerned range. Finally, the prediction is accomplished using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In the RNN, the weight is optimized using the hybrid J-SLnO. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can efficiently predict the future condition of components for maintenance planning by using two datasets-aircraft engine and lithium-ion battery datasets.","2022-03","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 04:45:21","","","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000774448000001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063387","learning (artificial intelligence); decision making; production engineering computing; recurrent neural nets; optimisation; support vector machines; maintenance engineering; machine learning; recurrent neural network; support vector machine; preventive maintenance; sustainable development; OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK; 0; industry 4; Jaya-based sea lion optimization; predictive maintenance planning; sustainable manufacturing; SYSTEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the overwhelming majority of current performance prediction models based on neural networks are deterministic. Therefore, this study combined Bayesian theory and neural networks to establish a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based probabilistic model for predicting pavement deterioration. The proposed model was built on the pavement data in Shanxi Province, China. This study first refined data using the K-Nearest Neighbour and empirical methods, and then selected input features based on correlation coefficient methods. Using the refined data, the deterministic neural network model was established to obtain the prior probability distribution of weights, and then the BNN-based probabilistic model was developed. Compared with the sole neural network model, the BNN-based model not only retains comparable prediction accuracy to the neural network model, but also incorporates uncertainties. The BNN-based model is also theoretically superior to the Markov-based probabilistic model because the former can incorporate all factors and does not need to classify performance values into states. The BNN-based model shall provide more reliable prediction results of pavement deterioration and help engineers make more reasonable maintenance decisions.","","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 13:55:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000803978700001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10298436.2022.2076854","Deterioration; Neural networks; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Nearest neighbor search; Bayesian networks; Correlation methods; data cleaning; Pavements; RULES; Bayesian neural network; CRASHES; Pavement deterioration; prediction; probabilistic model; UNCERTAINTY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with CAD, GIS tend to offer more flexibility in terms of managing, updating, analyzing, and processing data. Nonetheless, the conversion process to GIS can be extremely challenging from a technical point of view. Moreover, the original data in a legacy format often contain errors, and pieces of infrastructure are often missing. What is more, even once the conversion process is complete, the maintenance of the data and the fusion of the data set with other data sets can be challenging. Leveraging recent technological advances (such as machine learning and semantic reasoning), this paper proposes a framework to better manage infrastructure data. More specifically, a smart data-management protocol is presented to successfully convert infrastructure maps from CAD to GIS that includes a data-cleaning procedure in CAD and machine-learning algorithmic solutions to validate or suggest edits of the infrastructure once converted to GIS. In addition, the protocol includes elements of version control to keep track of how urban infrastructure evolves over time as well as a procedure to combine GIS infrastructure maps with other data sets (such as sociodemographic data) that can be used for optimal scheduling of asset maintenance and repair.

Remote sensing that holds detailed and abundant information on spectral, textual, contextual, and spatial configurations is crucial to obtaining land use maps that reveal changes in the urban environment. However, social sensing is essential to revealing the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of urban land use. This data mining approach is related to data cleaning/outlier removal and machine learning, and is used to achieve land use classification from remote and social sensing data. In bicycle and taxi density maps, the daytime destination and nighttime origin density reflects work-related land uses, including commercial and industrial areas. By contrast, the nighttime destination and daytime origin density pattern captures the pattern of residential areas. The accuracy assessment of land use classified maps shows that the integration of remote and social sensing, using the decision tree and random forest methods, yields accuracies of 83% and 86%, respectively. Thus, this approach facilitates an accurate urban land use classification.

The CBM aims to ensure the quality of labels' cut and overall machine performances. Design/methodology/approach In developing a complete CBM strategy, two main difficulties have to be overcome: (1) appropriately dealing with incomplete and low-quality production database and (2) selecting the most promising predictive model. The first issue has been addressed applying data cleansing operations and creating ad hoc methodology to enlarge the training data. The second issue has been handled developing and comparing an empirical model with a machine learning (ML)-based model; the comparison has been performed assessing capabilities thereof in predicting erroneous label cuts on data obtained from an operating plant located in Italy. Findings Research results showed that both empirical and ML-based approaches exhibit good performances in detecting the operating conditions of the cutting machine. The advantage of adopting an ML-based model is that it can be used not only as a condition indicator (i.e. a model able to continuously provide the health status of an asset) but also in predictive maintenance policies (i.e. a CBM carried out following a forecast of the degradation of the item). Research limitations/implications The study described in this manuscript has been developed on the practices of a labeling machine developed by an international company manufacturing bottling lines for beverage industry. The proposed approach might need some customization in case it is applied to other industries. Future researches can validate the applicability of such models on different rotary machines in other companies and similar industries. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper lies in the empirical demonstration of the benefits of CBM and predictive maintenance in manufacturing, through the overcoming of a specific production issue. The large number of variables involved in thin label cutting lines (film thickness between 30 and 38 mu m), the high throughput and the high costs due to production interruptions render the prediction of non-conforming labels an economically relevant, albeit challenging, goal. Moreover, despite the large scientific literature on CBM in rolling bearing and face cutting movements, papers dealing with rotary labeling machines are very unusual and unique.","2021-10-26","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 02:44:51","","565-585","","4","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000572418600001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JQME-10-2019-0101","Machine learning; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Turing machines; Industrial research; Manufacture; Roller bearings; Predictive maintenance; Throughput; Beverages; Entertainment industry; Rotating machinery; SUPPORT; CARBIDE TOOL; Cleansing data; Condition based maintenance; CUTTING PERFORMANCE; DRIVEN; Enlarging data set; FAILURE; Failure signature analysis; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; Prognostics; Weighted root mean square variation model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the prediction accuracy of SMART is unsatisfactory, recently, machine learning techniques have been explored to improve the prediction accuracy. Those approaches treat disk failure prediction as a binary classification problem and take SMART attributes as features, and some of them achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, there is no uniform metric to measure the financial impact of these methods whose primary objective is to reduce disk failure recovery costs via disk failure prediction. In this article, from a financial impact perspective, we propose a simple, yet practical, metric Mean-Cost-To-Recovery (MCTR) for disk failure prediction in data centers. Specifically, by assigning different weights to mispredicted healthy disks and failed disks, we measure the entire misprediction costs, that is, MCTR. In addition, we argue that the commonly used threshold 0.5 for disk failure prediction is suboptimal because of the fact of data imbalance, that is, failed disks are much fewer than healthy ones. To find the optimal threshold which renders minimal MCTR, we wrap a cost-minimizing procedure around disk failure prediction and use a threshold-moving technique for searching. Moreover, to map sample-level prediction results to disk-level prediction results, a modified leaky-bucket algorithm is design to determine the disk health state by considering its multiple sample-level prediction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments using three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that compared with reactive data protection schemes, we can reduce MCTR by up to 86.9%, and compared with cost-blind failure predictions, we can reduce MCTR by up to 22.3%.","2020-07-25","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 14:34:09","","","","14","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000522738200001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpe.5669","Learning systems; Forecasting; Digital storage; Cost reduction; Data privacy; machine learning; PERFORMANCE; failure prediction; failure recovery cost; hard disk drive; SMART","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they are often difficult to use as they lack the declarative language and optimization possibilities of relational engines. This paper introduces RumbleML, a high-level, declarative library integrated into the RumbleDB engine and with the JSONiq language. RumbleML allows using a single platform for data cleaning, data preparation, training, and inference, as well as management of models and results. It does it using a purely declarative language (JSONiq) for all these tasks and without any performance loss over existing platforms (e.g. Spark). The key insights of the design of RumbleML are that training sets, evaluation sets, and test sets can be represented as homogeneous sequences of flat objects; that models can be seamlessly embodied in function items mapping input test sets into prediction-augmented result sets; and that estimators can be seamlessly embodied in function items mapping input training sets to models. We argue that this makes JSONiq a viable and seamless programming language for data lakehouses across all their features, whether database-related or machine-learning-related. While lakehouses bring Machine Learning and Data Wrangling on the same platform, RumbleML also brings them to the same language, JSONiq. In the paper, we present the first prototype and compare its performance to Spark showing the benefit of a huge functionality and productivity gain for cleaning up, normalizing, validating data, feeding it into Machine Learning pipelines, and analyzing the output, all within the same system and language and at scale.MSC Codes 68N99 Copyright  2021, The Authors.

In FL, the data is kept locally by each user. This protects the user privacy, but also makes the server difficult to verify data quality, especially if the data are correctly labeled. Training with corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however, little attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to mitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight for each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization performance over a validation set. More formally, the process can be formulated as a Federated Bilevel Optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problem is a type of optimization problem with two levels of entangled problems. The non-distributed bilevel problems have witnessed notable progress recently with new efficient algorithms. However, solving bilevel optimization problems under the Federated Learning setting is under-investigated. We identify that the high communication cost in hypergradient evaluation is the major bottleneck. So we propose Comm-FedBiO to solve the general Federated Bilevel Optimization problems; more specifically, we propose two communication-efficient subroutines to estimate the hypergradient. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve the noisy label problem.

Although pollutants can be filtered to a considerable extent by after-treatment devices equipment, emissions can still exceed the designated standards when after-treatment devices function improperly. To timely identify excessive emissions, we propose a general and systematic framework, including a data quality assessment and a data repairing and excessive emission determination process, based on the data sensed from the on-board diagnostics (OBD) monitoring system. To overcome the adverse effects of poor data quality, a set of approaches have been developed for the different statuses of data quality. When all variables contain missing or abnormal values, data repairing algorithms can be employed to improve data quality. Two strategies have been developed for the situation where only the NOx data is problematic. One is to improve data quality by using the other variables before identifying excessive emissions, and the other is to directly predict whether the emissions exceed recommendations by using other variables without the data quality problem. To reduce the impact of noise and extreme values, three methods based on the moving average principle have been developed to generate an aggregated emission level for the determination of excessive emissions. In the experimental study, we employed a number of machine learning algorithms to achieve data repairing and prediction. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm slightly outperforms the random forests (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) in the prediction of the excessive emission possibility in terms of prediction accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the most accurate data repairing can be achieved by probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), as compared to non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). However, the proposed approach does not restrict other algorithms from achieving the functions of data repairing and prediction.  2022 by the authors.

Electricity forecasting models are considered a key aspect of the provision of better electricity management and reductions in energy consumption. This motivates the researchers to develop efficient electricity load forecasting (ELF) models, based on historical nonlinear and high volatile data, which require appropriate forecasting strategies. Therefore, in this article, we present an innovative two-phase framework for short-term ELF. The first phase is dedicated to data cleansing, in which pre-processing strategies are applied to raw data. In the second phase, a deep residual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract the important features from the refined data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a deep CNN architecture for the extraction of spatial features from electricity data. The output of the residual CNN network is forwarded to a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to learn the temporal information of the electricity data. The proposed model is then evaluated using the Individual-Household-Electric-Power-Consumption (IHEPC) and PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland (PJM) datasets. The results reveal a significant reduction in the error rate over the IHEPC dataset in terms of Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) (15.65%), Mean-Square-Error (MSE) (8.77%), and Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) (14.85%) and over the PJM dataset our method reduced RMSE up to 3.4% as compared to baseline models i.e., linear regression, LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Furthermore, we performed several experiments with CNN, LSTM, and GRU models and evaluated it with additional Coefficient of Variation of the RMSE (CV-RMSE) metrics, which proves the effectiveness of our model for short-term load forecasting.  2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2022-07-27 17:24:45","2022-07-31 14:02:46","","","","","53","","Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2022.102337","Brain; Long short-term memory; Electric power transmission networks; Errors; Data mining; Convolution; Mean square error; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Smart power grids; Electric utilities; Electric power plant loads; Electric load forecasting; Smart grids; Convolutional neural network; Building electricity consumption; Building energy simulation; CNN-LSTM; Electricity load forecasting; Residual CNN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What's more, some CGIs may also suffer from compression distortions in transmission systems like cloud gaming and stream media. However, limited work has been put forward to tackle the problem of computer graphics generated images' quality assessment (CG-IQA). Therefore, in this paper, we establish a large-scale subjective CG-IQA database to deal with the challenge of CG-IQA tasks. We collect 25,454 in-the-wild CGIs through previous databases and personal collection. After data cleaning, we carefully select 1,200 CGIs to conduct the subjective experiment. Several popular no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods are tested on our database. The experimental results show that the handcrafted-based methods achieve low correlation with subjective judgment and deep learning based methods obtain relatively better performance, which demonstrates that the current NR-IQA models are not suitable for CG-IQA tasks and more effective models are urgently needed.

The authors propose a novel default risk classification model based on data cleaning and feature extraction, which increases risk assessment accuracy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use borrower data from the Lending Club and propose the risk assessment model based on low-rank representation (LRR) and discriminant analysis. Firstly, the authors use three LRR models to clean the high-dimensional borrower data by removing outliers and noise, and then the authors adopt a discriminant analysis algorithm to reduce the dimension of the cleaned data. In the dimension-reduced feature space, machine learning classifiers including the k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and artificial neural network are used to assess and classify default risks. Findings: The results reveal significant noise and redundancy in the borrower data. LRR models can effectively clean such data, particularly the two LRR models with local manifold regularisation. In addition, the supervised discriminant analysis model, termed the local Fisher discriminant analysis model, can extract low-dimensional and discriminative features, which further increases the accuracy of the final risk assessment models. Originality/value: The originality of this study is that it proposes a novel default risk assessment model, based on data cleaning and feature extraction, for P2P online lending platforms.

Traditional data deduplication methods cannot meet the requirements for significant data analysis in terms of cost, efficiency, and usability. An interactive visual analysis method for data deduplication is proposed. It extracts high-dimensional feature vectors from multi-dimensional data through representation learning, projects the results into two-dimension space, employs an unsupervised clustering algorithm for analysis, and enables users to choose the algorithm and parameters in the visual analysis interface to gradually filter, identify, and remove duplicate data. Quantitative experiments and user studies are conducted on an extensive dataset from a supply chain integration service group company. The results show that proposed approach is more effective on complex data deduplication problems than mainstream data cleaning software, such as Trifacta Wrangler and OpenRefine, while achieving more than twice their efficiency and having significant superiority in learning cost and usability.  2022, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

Without a-priori knowledge the network is able to find representations of single-shot FEL spectra, which have a low signal-to-noise ratio, that reveal in a directly human-interpretable way crucial information about the photon properties. The central photon energy and the intensity as well as very detector-specific features are identified. The network is also capable of data cleaning, i.e. denoising as well as removal of artefacts. In the reconstruction, this allows for identification of signatures with very low intensity which are hardly recognisable in the raw data. In the present case the network enhances the quality of the diagnostic analysis at FLASH, though it has the potential to improve the analysis of similar kind of spectroscopy data.

The questionnaire surveys are often used in psychology research to collect self-report data and their preprocessing takes a lot of manual effort. Unlike with numerical data where the distance-based outliers prevail, the records in questionnaires have to be assessed from various perspectives that do not relate so much. We identify the most frequent types of errors in questionnaires. For each of them, we suggest different outliers detection methods ranking the records with the usage of normalized scores. Considering the similarity between pairs of outlier scores (some are highly uncorrelated), we propose an ensemble based on the union of outliers detected by different methods. Our outlier detection framework consists of some well-known algorithms but we also propose novel approaches addressing the typical issues of questionnaires.

Many machine deep learning models were trained for predicting the continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) or just the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) values based on a public database. However, jointly cleaning the PPG-ABP dataset that is the most critical pre-processing step for training quality is still in need for more investigations. There is a considerable amount of anomaly data that has to be excluded before any training stage. This paper introduces a two-level joint PPG-ABP cleaning technique conducted in a signal level and per-beat level. Many quality metrics have been checked successively for excluding improper data. These metrics achieve a coarse cleaning step. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) is exploited for fine cleaning the remaining data from the former stage. The cleaning efficiency is evaluated by measuring its impact on the deep-learning-based BP estimation models. The trained model based on our cleaned data shows performance enhancement in terms of prediction error and the correlation between the predicted and ground-truth BP. Segmented and cleaned PPG/ABP dataset will be publicly available in both signal level and beat level. Based on the simulation results, the proposed cleaning technique enhances standard deviation of the prediction error of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.68 % and 10.81 %, respectively. Also, it enhances mean absolute error of the prediction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 14.79 % and 11.70 %, respectively.  2013 IEEE.","2022","2022-07-27 17:24:46","2022-07-31 14:46:10","","55616-55626","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3175436","Cleaning; Deep learning; Quality control; Errors; Forecasting; Blood; Principal component analysis; Bleaching; Blood pressure; Photoplethysmography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the selection of the appropriate method for each step in the DMKD process, namely data cleaning, sampling, scaling, dimensionality reduction (DR), clustering, clustering analysis and data visualization to obtain meaningful insights is far from trivial. In this contribution, a computational environment (FastMan) is introduced and used to illustrate how method selection affects DMKD in chemical process data. Two case studies, using data from a simulated natural gas liquid plant and real data from an industrial pyrolysis unit, were conducted to demonstrate the applicability of these methodologies in real-life scenarios. Sampling and normalization methods were found to have a great impact on the quality of the DMKD results. Also, a neighbor graphs method for DR, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, outperformed principal component analysis, a matrix factorization method frequently used in the chemical process industry for identifying both local and global changes.

This work demonstrates an application of unsupervised machine learning for harvester yield monitoring recovery in the presence of noise for constructing a reliable yield map. The objective of this research is to propose a fully automated statistical and machine learning pipeline to clean primary harvested raw grain observations, regardless of combine series and types. Harvest yield observations are contaminated with different sources of error that obfuscate the spatial structure of the yield observations. The error sources are well-known, mostly inherited from the dynamic nature of operation, speed changes, irregular field topography, non-fully used cutting bar, and start/end delays of headland and filling/emptying times. To identify measurements with such error sources, the proposed pipeline incorporates two processing operations to be applied on the data. The first data cleaning operation is done by setting thresholds based on the lower and upper quartiles as well as the interquartile range (IQR) to detect outliers. In the second operation, the Robust Kernel Outlier Factor (RKOF) is deployed to detect local outliers. The developed method is tested on real yield monitoring data from winter wheat and wintery barley crops. Validation (root mean square error) demonstrates a 75% improvement in the yield map after eliminating the noise. The developed pipeline provides an automated outlier detection with a smaller number of outliers found in the dataset compared to other publications.  2022, VDI Verlag GMBH.

The state of the art in detection and diagnosis of faults is a manual and slow process. Experts with domain-knowledge use alarms, traces, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) data to understand the anomalies. In large-scale deployments, this is becoming an increasingly inefficient approach. The objective of this study is to determine anomalies in a WiFi network by exploiting big data, machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques. Our work comprises of setting up WiFi access points and retrieving the KPI of client devices which are connected to access points. The metrics for client devices, access points and channel nodes are periodically logged on the cloud, and collected through an API. We develop a multivariate time series data which undergoes data preprocessing, such as data cleaning and data transformation prior to using ML algorithms. To detect anomalous instances, an unsupervised algorithm, Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used. Clusters obtained through DBSCAN are analyzed under dimensionality reduction technique t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. While DBSCAN helps to obtain the outliers, the output of the dimensionality reduction technique enable us to coherently comprehend the dynamics of clusters. Our methodology involves a thorough analysis of the outliers from the dataset through legacy supervised and self-supervised ML models, as well as ensemble learning techniques.  2022 SPIE.

The goal of such attacks is to inject a small set of maliciously mislabeled training data into the training pipeline so as to detrimentally impact a machine learning model trained on such data. Constructing such attacks for cyber applications is especially challenging due to their realizability constraints. Furthermore, poisoning mitigation techniques for such applications are also not well understood. This paper investigates techniques for realizable data poisoning availability attacks (using several cyber applications), in which an attacker can insert a set of poisoned samples at the training time with the goal of degrading the accuracy of the deployed model. We design a white-box, realizable poisoning attack that degraded the original model's accuracy by generating mislabeled samples in close vicinity of a selected subset of training points. We investigate this strategy and its modifications for key classifier architectures and provide specific implications for each of them. The paper also proposes a novel data cleaning method as a defense against such poisoning attacks. Our defense includes a diversified ensemble of classifiers, each trained on a different subset of the training set. We use the disagreement of the classifiers' predictions as a decision whether to keep a given sample in the training dataset or remove it. The results demonstrate the efficiency of this strategy with very limited performance penalty.  2022 SPIE","2022","2022-07-27 17:24:54","2022-07-27 17:24:54","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","","","12117","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","SPIE","Virtual, Online","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2622112","Machine learning; Classification (of information); Network security; Intrusion detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning (ML) has been applied to accelerate these processes. It is a new paradigm for bioprinting. In this review, we explore current trends in bioink formulation and how ML has been used to accelerate optimization and enable real-time error detection as well as to reduce the iterative steps necessary for bioink formulation. We examined how rheometric properties, including shear storage, loss moduli, viscosity, shear-thinning property of biomaterials affect the printability of a bioink. Furthermore, we scrutinized the interplays between yield shear stress and the printability of a bioink.

Appropriate polishing parameters are mainly based on an accurate polishing model and an excellent polishing parameters optimization algorithm. However, due to the complicated principle of MCF polishing and various influencing elements, traditional modeling methods have the limitations of low accuracy, poor application, and difficulty in correcting. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain the optimal polishing quality by optimizing the polishing parameters based on the traditional model.

Two prong presentations are the aims of this paper; first, the analysis to remove the Phishing features from the email, and second, a notable triumph to reduce the complex data set to a lower dimension with different features. The feature reduction process is based on classification and prediction accuracy. The training and testing dataset is a collection of 1500 data tuples from the SPAMASSASIAN corpus. The validation dataset is made by retrieving the emails from Gmail users. To decide the two class codes, PHISHING and HAM, a total of 2000 emails are used to train, test, and validate the data tuples. In this research, 1000 emails are used to train, 500 emails are used to test the data tuples and validate them. First, the dataset is preprocessed to parse the data using HTML Parsing, Data Cleaning, Stemming, Stop Word Elimination, and Tokenization. By reading each email iteratively from the dataset, the features are extracted. Classifier ensemble strategies have gained the attention of many researchers in the machine learning research community in recent years [1]. Three machine learning classification algorithms are applied to predict the PHISHING and HAM emails such as decision trees (J48), random forest, and logistic regression. It was found that the random forest algorithm works best to separate PHISHING and HAM emails with the precision of a 99% classifier.

This paper proposes an unsupervised end-to-end methodology based on both a data cleaning strategy and explainable machine learning models to detect and classify performance anomalies in mobile networks. The proposed approach, dubbed clean and explainable anomaly detection and classification (KLNX), aims at identifying attributes and operation scenarios that could induce anomalous KPI values without resorting to parameter tuning. Unlike previous methodologies, the proposed method includes a data cleaning stage that extracts and removes experiments and attributes considered outliers in order to train the anomaly detection engine with the cleanest possible dataset. Additionally, machine learning models provide interpretable information about features and boundaries describing both the normal network behavior and the anomalous scenarios. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a testbed generating synthetic data is developed using a known TCP throughput model. Finally, the methodology is assessed on a real data set captured by operational tests in commercial networks.","2022","2022-07-27 17:24:58","2022-07-31 14:36:56","","103-12","","","","","","","2022 20th Mediterranean Communication and Computer Networking Conference (MedComNet).","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MedComNet55087.2022.9810378","Cleaning; data handling; unsupervised learning; Throughput; Data models; Task analysis; Training data; data preprocessing; mobile communication; telecommunication network performance; telecommunication security; anomaly detection and classification; Behavioral sciences; explainable machine learning; Key performance indicator; mobile networks.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quality professionals are required to classify and review the inspection texts according to the project category. However, manual processing of a sheer amount of textual data is not only time-consuming, laborious but also error-prone, which could lead to overlooked quality issues and harm the overall project performance. In response, this paper uses the text mining method to mine the hidden information from unstructured text records. First, obtain quality text records on-site, use data cleaning method to obtain 9859 clean data, then use both Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) pre-training and Word2vec methods to quantify the text into a digital representation, next improve the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by expanding input channels, and input the quantified text into the model to extract key features to realize the integration of quality records according to established categories. The results show that the average precision of the proposed model is 89.69%. Compared with CNN, BERT, and other models, this model has less manual intervention, less time-consuming training, and higher precision.

But when an LM generates an assertion, it is often difficult to determine where it learned this information and whether it is true. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for fact tracing: tracing language models assertions back to the training examples that provided evidence for those predictions. Prior work has suggested that dataset-level influence methods might offer an effective framework for tracing predictions back to training data. However, such methods have not been evaluated for fact tracing, and researchers primarily have studied them through qualitative analysis or as a data cleaning technique for classification/regression tasks. We present the first experiments that evaluate influence methods for fact tracing, using well-understood information retrieval (IR) metrics. We compare two popular families of influence methods  gradient-based and embedding-based  and show that neither can fact-trace reliably; indeed, both methods fail to outperform an IR baseline (BM25) that does not even access the LM. We explore why this occurs (e.g., gradient saturation) and demonstrate that existing influence methods must be improved significantly before they can reliably attribute factual predictions in LMs.1 Copyright  2022, The Authors.

To reduce the dependency on well-aligned image-text pairs, it is promising to directly leverage the large-scale text-only and image-only corpora. This paper proposes a data augmentation method, namely cross-modal CutMix (CMC), for implicit cross-modal alignment learning in unpaired VLP. Specifically, CMC transforms natural sentences from the textual view into a multi-modal view, where visually-grounded words in a sentence are randomly replaced by diverse image patches with similar semantics. There are several appealing proprieties of the proposed CMC. First, it enhances the data diversity while keeping the semantic meaning intact for tackling problems where the aligned data are scarce; Second, by attaching cross-modal noise on uni-modal data, it guides models to learn token-level interactions across modalities for better denoising. Furthermore, we present a new unpaired VLP method, dubbed as VLMixer, that integrates CMC with contrastive learning to pull together the uni-modal and multi-modal views for better instance-level alignments among different modalities. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks show that VLMixer could surpass previous state-of-the-art unpaired VLP methods. Copyright  2022, The Authors.

Finally, three different models were built with a goal of predicting customers' purchase behavior (in this case purchase value). After comparing the results of the models, it was concluded that Random Forest Regressor performed the best.

The complexity of the problem is related to different aspects, including the large number of stores and products of modern retailers, the complex marketing and promotional strategies that impact customer demand, and cross-product effects that are difficult to model. We propose a method that encompasses (i) data cleansing methods for improving sales information usually available for retailers, (ii) a learning algorithm that considers marketing, promotional and cross-product variables and (iii) a structural change correction method to account for disruptions in consumer behavior. Our approach is validated using a real public dataset from a large retailer (Corporacion Favorita) containing data from 54 stores and 4036 products. Our accuracy results are compared to the Base-Lift model, a widely used benchmark model for retail forecasting. Results show that our proposed approach yields improvements up to 26.72% in accuracy metrics, outperforming conventional forecasting models. The results of a simulation conducted with the aim to quantify the advantage of more accurate forecasting on inventory performance show a 45.83% reduction in stockouts and 7.51% reduction in stock on hand. Finally, it is also important to highlight that the approach itself has a high degree of automation, which is an important requirement for modern retailers.  2022, The Authors.

Although powerful and widely used, inference queries are susceptible to incorrect results if the model is biased due to training data errors. Recently, prior work Rain proposed complaint-driven data debugging which uses user-specified errors in the output of inference queries (Complaints) to rank erroneous training examples that most likely caused the complaint. This can help users better interpret results and debug training sets. Rain combined influence analysis from the ML literature with relaxed query provenance polynomials from the DB literature to approximate the derivative of complaints w.r.t. training examples. Although effective, the runtime is O(|T|d), where T and d are the training set and model sizes, due to its reliance on the model's second order derivatives (the Hessian). On a Wide Resnet Network (WRN) model with 1.5 million parameters, it takes 1 minute to debug a complaint. We observe that most complaint debugging costs are independent of the complaint, and that modern models are overparameterized. In response, Rain++ uses precomputation techniques, based on non-trivial insights unique to data debugging, to reduce debugging latencies to a constant factor independent of model size. We also develop optimizations when the queried database is known apriori, and for standing queries over streaming databases. Combining these optimizations in Rain++ ensures interactive debugging latencies (1ms) on models with millions of parameters.  2022 ACM.","2022","2022-07-27 17:25:01","2022-07-31 02:43:30","","369-383","","","","","","","Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3514221.3517849","Machine learning; Query languages; Query processing; Rain; machine learning debugging, data cleaning, data provenance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Making the best use of these mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a route-level prediction model for public transit.

Further in terms of data quality control in the soil moisture data quality control strategy was proposed for data cleaning and established the soil moisture content data correction and interpolation model, in the cloud background received by the TCP/IP protocol of the Internet of things device came back after the packet data parsing and quality judgment. For abnormal or missing data, through the calibration data interpolation model to predict, avoided the interruption problem caused by the missing data, ensured data accuracy, integrity, and availability. Moreover, the soil moisture content data correction and interpolation model adopted the deep learning algorithm and the Stacking strategy to merge the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) networks. The soil moisture content monitoring system facing the national scale had the characteristics of a large number of automatic station devices, massive user visits, and vast amounts of data computation, and had the characteristics of high frequency, high concurrency, and continuous growth. The ordinary web architecture could not ensure the stable and reliable operation of the system. Therefore, the system adopted the cloud-native technology system suitable for the cloud computing characteristics, used the micro-service architecture and the container technology to construct a flexible development model, and improved the efficiency of computing resource utilization. The system architecture design was based on the cloud-native technology, the module of the system was flexibly developed and deployed in the form of micro-services, the independent instance of packaging and running container technology was used to solve the problem of environmental configuration and resource utilization efficiency, and the container was dynamically scheduled to optimize the utilization of cloud computing resources. The core modules such as soil moisture content data reporting collection, soil moisture content data visualization analysis, and soil moisture content data mining application were arranged in the system. Based on GIS (Geographic Information System) spatial analysis and WebGL technology, the front-end 3D WebGIS data analysis function module was developed, and the collaborative Kriging interpolation method was used to realize the online analysis and visual mapping of collaborative soil moisture content, land use types, altitude, and other multi-source data. The system mined the data value deeply and utilized the deep learning algorithm to realize the soil moisture content prediction service which used the data of the past 8 days to predict the data of the next day. Based on the principle of water balance, the application service of irrigation decision was realized. By selecting the crop coefficient recommended by FAO and the growth stage of the corresponding planting crops, the water demand of crops was calculated, and the water balance analysis was realized and the reference irrigation water quantity was recommended. Since its application, the system had been deeply applied in more than 21 provinces, 970 automatic monitoring stations had been established, and more than 60 million automatic moisture monitoring stations had been collected.

The calculation accuracy of the temperature model depends to a large extent on the selection of heat transfer coefficient. In this study, the industrial production data was cleaned and screened by the clustering algorithm to obtain training sample data, and based on BP neural networks, the mapping relationship between different influencing factors and heat transfer coefficient was established. According to the change of production conditions, the heat transfer coefficient is learned adaptively, which improves the prediction accuracy of the model. By comparing the predicted and actual temperature values over a period of time, the deviation between most predicted and actual values is less than 20C, and the deviation is reduced by about 30C compared with that before the BP network was used to study the heat transfer coefficient. Under the constraints of the target temperature and the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the section, the precise control of the cooling temperature of the hot-rolled ribbed bar is realized by the calculation of the temperature prediction model.","2020","2022-07-27 17:25:26","2022-07-27 17:25:26","","012111 (5 pp.)","","","585","","","","IOP Conf.

Many researchers have been interested in applying many statistical tools as well as many different data mining tools in order to improve an analysis process and extract data from a different data set. The only thing that proves the success and robustness of data mining tool is accurate diagnosis of the disease. According to the (WHO), the biggest cause of death in the last ten years or so in this vast world is heart disease. The statistical exploration tools that researchers use are tools that help decision-makers in health care to predict and diagnose heart disease. The tools used in the diagnostic process for heart disease have been thoroughly tested in order to demonstrate sufficient and acceptable accuracy. A set of patient data divided into 665 records was used, of which 300 were for males, with 365 for females, with 10 different related characteristics. The decision-making department still suffers from a lack of performance and decision-making. Our paper aims to process data in different ways before the process of accessing knowledge to make the appropriate decision through expectations of classification analysis and then using techniques to extract data with acceptable accuracy. Our goal proposed in this paper is to purify the data before the disease prediction process to get the best possible prediction and compare the results with the results of a group of previous researchers to reach an accurate diagnosis and prediction. The second part of our goal is to compare between different technologies on different data sets such as decision tree technology and the second technique is Bayesian classification technology and the last technology is neural networks and the results were (98.85%, 98.16%, 91.31%), respectively. In the end, we hope to obtain acceptable results with high accuracy in the future, enhance clinical diagnosis, and promote appropriate decision-making for early treatment specialists.","2020","2022-07-27 17:25:27","2022-07-27 17:25:27","","7 pp.","","","","","","","2020 2nd International Congress on Human-Computer Interaction, Optimization and Robotic Applications (HORA)","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HORA49412.2020.9152870","neural nets; statistical analysis; data mining; decision making; diseases; health care; medical diagnostic computing; patient diagnosis; decision trees; cardiology; medical administrative data processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Hence, sampling technology has been widely studied and used in big data context, e.g., methods for determining sample size, combining sampling with big data processing frameworks. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Therefore, this paper focuses on researching sampling and profiling in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling tasks. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.

In order to meet the real-time, continuous and reliable positioning requirements of vehicle navigation, this paper presents the principle and method of constructing high-precision map with stereo vision, and introduces the key technologies of map generation and data cleaning. Meanwhile, it analyzes the performance of the map-aided visual-inertial fusion positioning method. Firstly, the visual point cloud map is constructed based on mobile surveying. The local coordinates of road marking points are obtained by the front intersection of common-view pictures, then the camera pose solved from GNSS/SINS converted road marking points from local coordinate system to ECEF. However, the quantity of road marking points is large, and the absolute precision is difficult to evaluate. Therefore, this paper gives the quality indexes of evaluating point cloud map precision and data cleaning method. By using the method of deep learning to target recognition and semantic segmentation, only the long-term static stable road markings can be maintained in the map. In the meantime, a visual positioning method based on Octomap and DBOW acceleration is proposed. The KITTI dataset test shows that point cloud map is constructed and an average data cleaning rate is 35.05%, that many error observations are excluded. When it comes to positioning, the accuracy of visual/GNSS/INS integrated positioning yields about 2cm and 0.06. When integrated with INS, a positioning accuracy of 10cm can be maintained with only one road landmark matched successfully in the case of GNSS long time (20min) unlock.  2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2020","2022-07-27 17:25:28","2022-07-27 17:25:28","","498-509","","","652 LNEE","","","","Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Chengdu, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-3715-8_45","Global positioning system; Cleaning; Deep learning; Statistical tests; Semantics; Roads and streets; Navigation; Highway markings; Inertial navigation systems; Road and street markings; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is not just a technical step in a data cleaning process but a key topic in many fields such as fraudulent document detection, in medical applications and assisted diagnosis systems or detecting security threats. In contrast to population-based methods, neighborhood based local approaches are simple flexible methods that have the potential to perform well in small sample size unbalanced problems. However, a main concern of local approaches is the impact that the computation of each sample neighborhood has on the method performance. Most approaches use a distance in the feature space to define a single neighborhood that requires careful selection of several parameters. This work presents a local approach based on a local measure of the heterogeneity of sample labels in the feature space considered as a topological manifold. Topology is computed using the communities of a weighted graph codifying mutual nearest neighbors in the feature space. This way, we provide with a set of multiple neighborhoods able to describe the structure of complex spaces without parameter fine tuning. The extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach overall outperforms, both, local and global strategies in multi and single view settings. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven method. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some limitations in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale benchmark on object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 sub-categories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the quantity of instances and the quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution, (4) it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel evaluation method and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a visual classification task using several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep learning-based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results strongly indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is considerably more challenging than existing datasets.","2021-03-09","2022-07-27 17:25:29","2022-07-27 17:25:29","","19 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","learning (artificial intelligence); pattern classification; geographic information systems; image classification; object detection; object recognition; remote sensing; geophysical image processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing amount of data, the improvement of real-time processing requirement and the bottleneck of CPU performance improvement, the traditional serial algorithms of similarity join have been unable to meet the requirement of current big data processing. As a co-processor, GPU has achieved good acceleration results in machine learning and other fields in recent years. It is of great practical significance to study the parallel similarity join algorithms based on GPU. This paper proposes a parallel similarity join algorithm based on CPU-GPU heterogeneous architecture. Firstly, GPU is used to construct inverted index based on SoA (struct of arrays), which solves the problem of low efficiency of traditional index structure in parallel reading and writing. Then, to address the performance problem of serial algorithms, a parallel dual-length filtering algorithm based on filter-verification framework is proposed. Inverted index and prefix filtering algorithm are used to further improve the filtering performance. And in our approach, the calculation for exact similarity verification is performed by CPU to make full use of heterogeneous computing resources of CPU-GPU. Finally, experiments are carried out on several datasets. Compared with the serial similarity join algorithms, the results show that our proposed algorithms have better filtering performance and lower index generation time than existing algorithms, and also have better processing performance and higher speedup ratio on the similarity join.  2021, Science Press.

"2H4GWUCS","thesis","2021","Masse, Robert C.","Towards High-Energy Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries and Battery Analytics for Electric Aviation","","","","","","Since its commercialization in 1991, the rechargeable Li-ion battery has revolutionized how we live, work, and communicate. Further, rapidly declining costs have enabled the ongoing electrification of heavy industry, from automotive to power utilities and even aviation. Despite these important advances, reaching the targets required to minimize the effects of climate change requires improvements to battery technology across all levels of research and developmentfrom basic materials chemistry to optimizations in manufacturing and operations in the field. This work represents a cross-cutting effort that spans the breadth of this range. In the experimental portion, the fundamental electrochemistry of magnesium was studied in the context of developing new positive and negative electrode materials for magnesium batteries. In particular, we show how considering the system as two interfaces (cathode-electrolyte and anode-electrolyte) rather than three components (cathode, anode, and electrolyte) helps explain some of the nuances of magnesium compared to lithium electrochemistry. In the second part of this work, we address applied problems in the growing field of battery data science and analytics. We develop software tools and models for industry-relevant problems in basic battery data management, cell lifetime forecasting and validation, and specific applications in electric aviation. Magnesium batteries represent a compelling candidate for the next generation of battery chemistries. It offers the prospect of safer operation at lower costs to manufacture and ~60% greater energy density compared to Li-ion batteries. However, many problems at the anode-electrolyte and cathode-electrolyte interfaces need to be resolved. Many electrolytes passivate magnesium metal and are oxidized at the cathode, and the nature of the kinetics (both reaction and diffusion) is unclear. In the two main prongs of this section of this work we propose 1) a coating that provides kinetic stability to the anode, and 2) an electrochemical protocol for studying magnesium cathode materials with greater clarity and reliability. Together we believe these approaches may be married to each other to develop a robust, high-energy magnesium battery based on a magnesium metal anode and a metal oxide cathode. We also explore battery data science as it applies to the new electric aviation industry. There are three main contributions. First, we report a user-friendly software environment for battery data science. It is designed to streamline data management, data cleaning, and data analysis to help bridge the gap between the domain expertise of most battery scientists and the tools needed as the field becomes increasingly data intensive. Second, we use a neural network model to extend state-of-the-art cell cycle life predictions to include a wider range of datasets and testing conditions, such as C-rate, cell chemistry, and temperature. Third, we train an outlier detection algorithm to rapidly identify weak cell blocks in an electric aircraft battery pack. This is significant in that identifying weak cells helps determine the remaining useful life in a battery system, which is of utmost importance for flight operators. Each of these constitute pieces of an effort that is oriented toward developing standard operating procedures for battery safety, performance, and maintenance for electric aviation.

"8CFW4LDZ","thesis","2021","Teghipco, Alex","Parcellating Speech Networks Using Connectivity and Multivariate Meta-Analysis","","","","","","A densely interconnected patchwork of cortical areas tiles the brain, balancing the integration and segregation of functions. The eminent strategy for charting the functions of this landscape has involved pinning tightly controlled behavioral tasks onto large and often isolated patches of cortex in piecemeal. Recent developments have made it possible to study the organization of this rich functional landscape from the bottom-up, by mapping the connectivity networks that underpin brain areas situated within larger functional regions. At the same time, the availability of large databases that aggregate published functional neuroimaging work make it possible to infer the functions of such connectivity-defined areas from a much broader behavioral space than can be accessed by any individual study. In the first study of the present work, this bottom-up approach was leveraged to elucidate functional organization around the planum temporale (PT), an anatomical region that has been shown to be critical to speech production, but which has also been associated with a variety of other functions in functional neuroimaging studies. Functional connectivity estimated from multiecho resting state data (N =137) was used to map areas within the posterior perisylvian zone that functional neuroimaging studies have associated with the PT. A deliberate parcellation of this zone was produced by forming cluster ensembles from complementary unsupervised learning algorithms that produced reliable parcellations (12 clustering approaches were tested for their reliability). The resulting parcellation was well-aligned with observer-independent architectonic work, and even outperformed several popular atlases when used to classify external data. Registering the networks and areas within this parcellation to published functional neuroimaging work revealed that the functional zone associated with the PT was comprised of multiple speech areas, including an area involved in rehearsal and an area involved in production. Further, multiple areas were associated with receptive speech, auditory, and sensorimotor processing. At a broad level, a second study tested the extent to which there can be agreement between areas defined from the bottom-up based on connectivity data, and functional areas embedded in published neuroimaging work. That is, a parcellation of temporal and inferior parietal cortex based on structural connectivity (N = 70) was compared to a parcellation resulting from the same clustering approach adapted to brain-behavior associations (i.e., meta-analyses of behaviors). This functional parcellation carved out areas with similar behavioral profiles and was implemented in the service of localizing areas involved in speech perception. Prior meta-analytic studies with the same goal have used sample sizes now known to be insufficient, produced incompatible results, and failed to consider whether speech responsive areas are involved in other functions. Clustering was performed over lower-dimensional functional networks extracted from brain-behavior associations. Auditory and speech processes were robustly distinguished irrespective of how many functional networks were defined. A more optimal set of functional networks showed evidence of a posteriorly directed speech processing hierarchy that implicated an area in ventral superior temporal gyrus, posterior to auditory cortex, in speech sound analysis. The functional parcellation isolated areas along this speech hierarchy and captured the extent to which they were shared across functional networks. Overall, there was significant spatial correspondence between the functional and structural parcellations, and the parcel associated with speech sound processing showed the best fit to structural connectivity data. Structural data indicated that this parcel could be distinguished based on its strong connectivity along the middle longitudinal fasciculus. A third study investigated a more targeted hypothesis about the role of pMTG in error correction. The results of this study helped better characterize the function of one of two areas from the functional parcellation presented in the second study that were both associated with the pMTG, but difficult to functionally distinguish in a precise way. Previous work has demonstrated suggestive evidence of internal error detection and correction in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) on the basis that this area tended toward showing a stronger response when potential speech errors (i.e., not realized) are biased towards nonwords compared to words. Building on this prior work, an experiment was designed introducing novel tongue twister stimuli that attempted to further tax internal error correction and detection mechanisms by biasing potential speech errors towards taboo words. Although the pMTG demonstrated significantly greater response to taboo words than neutral words in a large sample of participants (N=40), other areas also showed an effect. Behavioral associations in the wider neuroimaging literature were used to better understand the functional significance of activity outside the pMTG, demonstrating that only activity within this area was likely to signal word-level processing, and therefore explain the internal error correction mechanism investigated. Taken together, these studies present a more nuanced description of the functional and structural networks underpinning the speech system and point to more specific functions that these networks may support.

However, if the training data are corrupted by noisy labels, the resulting performance might be deteriorated. In the domain of medical image analysis, this dilemma becomes extremely severe. This is because the medical image annotation always requires medical expertise and clinical experience, which would inevitably introduce subjectivity. In this paper, we design a novel algorithm based on the teacher-student architecture for noisy-labeled medical image segmentation. Creatively, We introduce confident learning (CL) method to identify the corrupted labels and endow CNN an anti-interference ability to the noises. Specifically, the CL technique is introduced to the teacher model to characterize the suspected wrong-labeled pixels. Since the noise identification maps are a little away from sufficient precision, the spatial label smoothing regularization technique is utilized to generate soft-corrected masks for training the student model. Since our method identifies and revises the noisy labels of the training data in a pixel-level rather than simply assigns lower weights to the noisy masks, it outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the noisy-labeled image segmentation task on the JSRT dataset, especially when the training data are severely corrupted by noises.

As the factors that may be involved in the observation can be many, e.g, all different types of clerical errors or unintended transformations of the data, we assume a probabilistic model that describes the distribution over all possible ways in which the clean (uncertain) database could have been polluted. Based on this model we define two computational problems: data cleaning and probabilistic query answering and study for both of them their corresponding complexity when considering that the transformation of the database can be caused by either removing (subset) or adding (superset) nodes and edges.

All the works in this paper uses benchmark datasets from University of California Irvine machine learning repository for verification. Clinical datasets are obtained through various diagnostics procedures, and the data from different sources was transformed into a single format before the start of the analysis. Since there are many diagnostics procedures, the transformed data usually has a large number of features. Preliminary data cleaning procedures like duplicate removal, noise dismissal, and filling up of missing data are performed initially. Data reduction techniques are applied over this cleaned data. A dataset is mainly due to two main reasons: too many instances or too many attributes. Once the noisy and duplicate instances are removed, having too many instances usually generates an accurate classifier. However, having too many features is a negative aspect of data analytics because the dataset's unimportant features tend to bring down the classifier's accuracy that has produced using the dataset. Reducing the number of features to an optimal level to enhance the classifier's accuracy is the aim of feature reduction algorithms. Every disease has various stages of severity.

Saliency maps are one of the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing for a mask over the input dimensions so that the output of the network for a given class is influenced the most. However, prior work only studies such influence by removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework to generate saliency maps for blackbox networks by considering both removal and preservation of evidence. Additionally, we introduce the bilateral total variation term to the optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under high resolution and with thin object parts. We validate the capabilities of iGOS++ by extensive experiments and comparison against state-of-the-art saliency map methods. Our results show significant improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by humans. Besides, we showcased the capabilities of our method, iGOS++, in a real-world application of AI on medical data: the task of classifying COVID-19 cases from x-ray images.

"YPL77TPF","journalArticle","2021","Meseguer Brocal, Gabriel","Multimodal analysis: Informed content estimation and audio source separation","","","23318422","","","This dissertation proposes the study of multimodal learning in the context of musical signals. Throughout, we focus on the interaction between audio signals and text information. Among the many text sources related to music that can be used (e.g. reviews, metadata, or social network feedback), we concentrate on lyrics. The singing voice directly connects the audio signal and the text information in a unique way, combining melody and lyrics where a linguistic dimension complements the abstraction of musical instruments. Our study focuses on the audio and lyrics interaction for targeting source separation and informed content estimation. Real-world stimuli are produced by complex phenomena and their constant interaction in various domains. Our understanding learns useful abstractions that fuse different modalities into a joint representation. Multimodal learning describes methods that analyse phenomena from different modalities and their interaction in order to tackle complex tasks. This results in better and richer representations that improve the performance of the current machine learning methods. To develop our multimodal analysis, we need first to address the lack of data containing singing voice with aligned lyrics. This data is mandatory to develop our ideas. Therefore, we investigate how to create such a dataset automatically leveraging resources from the World Wide Web. Creating this type of dataset is a challenge in itself that raises many research questions. We are constantly working with the classic ""chicken or the egg"" problem: acquiring and cleaning this data requires accurate models, but it is difficult to train models without data. We propose to use the teacher-student paradigm to develop a method where dataset creation and model learning are not seen as independent tasks but rather as complementary efforts. In this process, non-expert karaoke time-aligned lyrics and notes describe the lyrics as a sequence of time-aligned notes with their associated textual information. We then link each annotation to the correct audio and globally align the annotations to it. For this purpose, we use the normalized cross-correlation between the voice annotation sequence and the singing voice probability vector automatically, which is obtained using a deep convolutional neural network. Using the collected data we progressively improve that model. Every time we have an improved version, we can in turn correct and enhance the data. Collecting data from the Internet comes with a price and it is error-prone. We propose a novel data cleansing (a well-studied topic for cleaning erroneous labels in datasets) to identify automatically any errors which remain, allowing us to estimate the overall accuracy of the dataset, select points that are correct, and improve erroneous data. Our model is trained by automatically contrasting likely correct label pairs against local deformations of them. We demonstrate that the accuracy of a transcription model improves greatly when trained on filtered data with our proposed strategy compared with the accuracy when trained using the original dataset. After developing the dataset, we center our efforts in exploring the interaction between lyrics and audio in two different tasks. First, we improve lyric segmentation by combining lyrics and audio using a model-agnostic early fusion approach. As a pre-processing step, we create a coordinate representation as self-similarity matrices (SMMs) of the same dimensions for both domains. This allows us to easy adapt an existing deep neural model to capture the structure of both domains. Through experiments, we show that each domain captures complementary information that benefit the overall performance. Secondly, we explore the problem of music source separation (i.e. to isolate the different instruments that appear in an audio mixture) using conditioned learning. In this paradigm, we aim to effectively control data-driven models by context information. We present a novel approach based on the U-Net that implements conditioned learning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). We first formalise the problem as a multitask source separation using weak conditioning. In this scenario, our method performs several instrument separations with a single model without losing performance, adding just a small number of parameters. This shows that we can effectively control a generic neural network with some external information. We then hypothesize that knowing the aligned phonetic information is beneficial for the vocal separation task and investigate how we can integrate conditioning mechanisms into informed-source separation using strong conditioning. We adapt the FiLM technique for improving vocal source separation once we know the aligned phonetic sequence. We show that our strategy outperforms the standard non-conditioned architecture. Finally, we summarise our contributions highlighting the main research questions we approach and our proposed answers. We discuss in detail potential future work, addressing each task individually. We propose new use cases of our dataset as well as ways of improving its reliability, and analyze our conditional approach and the different strategies to improve it.  2021, CC BY-NC-SA.","2021","2022-07-27 17:25:45","2022-07-27 17:25:45","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Deep neural networks; Complex networks; Separation; Modal analysis; Abstracting; Audio acoustics; Music; Musical instruments; Source separation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, data collection has become one of the most essential functions of large organizations. In this work, a data engineering experiment for a grinding process within a commercial orthotics manufacturing company is presented. The data collection and labelling is assessed for time stamp latency using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. This step is necessary to determine if alarm prediction or 'front running' is feasible. The paper analyses the procured dataset and discusses its merits as an alarm predictor, using sparsity indicators and concludes that a new investment in sensor infrastructure is necessary. This work highlights some of the limits of performance that exist for the use of MQTT with existing sensor infrastructure when retrofitting machine learning based alarm prediction in an industrial use case setting.

How to transform the huge ""data resources"" into ""data assets"" and fully utilize data and tap their real value to better serve society is a main concern in the oil and gas industry today. Therefore, the oil industry needs to complete the industrial upgrading of ""Smart Oilfield"" through digital and intelligent transformation. In recent years, the rise of big data technology and artificial intelligence have allowed international oil companies and oil service giants to accelerate the construction of digital and intelligent oil fields. The overall framework of the big data intelligent platform of oil and gas resources should be based on data resources with big data platform computing power as the support and artificial intelligence algorithms as the core. To meet the production needs of the oil and gas industry, it is of great urgency to build an oil and gas data resource pool that integrates exploration, development, and production data. The data quality can be improved via data cleaning and fusion. Physical simulations, data mining, and other approaches should be combined to achieve the modularization of service functions. Additionally, the goals of intelligent monitoring, early warning, and display on multi-dimensional platforms such as PC, control screen, and mobile apps can also be achieved. The analysis of artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning in the context of the oil and gas industry shows that these methods have good application prospects. In the future, oil companies should work together with scientific research institutes to tap the huge potential of oil industry data, achieve cost reduction and efficiency increase, and build a new smart oil and gas industrial ecosystem to complete industrial upgrading.

The data set of line profiles used for the analysis was obtained on April 20th, 2020, at the center of the solar disc, and contains almost 300,000 individual Mg II k line profiles after data cleaning. The data are separated into train and test subsets. The train subset was used to train the autoencoder of the varying embedding layer size. The early stopping criterion was implemented on the test subset to prevent the model from overfitting. Our results indicate that it is possible to compress the spectral line profiles more than 27 times (which corresponds to the reduction of the data dimensionality from 110 to 4) while having a 4 DN (Data Number) average reconstruction error, which is comparable to the variations in the line continuum. The mean squared error and the reconstruction error of even statistical moments sharply decrease when the dimensionality of the embedding layer increases from 1 to 4 and almost stop decreasing for higher numbers. The observed occasional improvements in training for values higher than 4 indicate that a better compact embedding may potentially be obtained if other training strategies and longer training times are used. The features learned for the critical four-dimensional case can be interpreted. In particular, three of these four features mainly control the line width, line asymmetry, and line dip formation respectively. The presented results are the first attempt to obtain a compact embedding for spectroscopic line profiles and confirm the value of this approach, in particular for feature extraction, data compression, and denoising.

To work around the under-resourced issue, the main technical aspects of our ASR system include various deep learning techniques, such as transfer learning, semi-supervised learning, front-end speech enhancement and model ensemble, as well as data cleansing and data augmentation conducted on the training data. With the best configuration, our system takes the first place among all participating systems in Track 3.","2021-04-09","2022-07-27 17:25:45","2022-07-27 17:25:45","","17 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","learning (artificial intelligence); natural language processing; linguistics; speech enhancement; speech recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SHCs are the true representative of precise and useful information about the physicochemical properties and nutrient status of agricultural soil. Before SHCs, the soil test records generally lie with soil test laboratories (STLs) and their availability in form of soil datasets is very limited. Moreover, the datasets are not big enough to be utilized as test datasets in soil investigation and development of futuristic and intelligent decision support and advisory systems. To address the issue, this paper presents a simple method for soil dataset preparation from SHCs for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based soil research and analysis applications. The method collects wide number of SHCs for particular location and applies simple parsing and data cleaning concepts, implemented by utilizing open-source python libraries, to set of SHCs to prepare soil dataset. The dataset prepared by the proposed method can be used in a variety of intelligent data-driven decision support applications such as soil classification, nutrient prediction, and fertilizer recommendation. The dataset thus generated by the proposed method would help both researchers and soil scientists in their future research on soil health monitoring and decision support for sustainable farm management.","2021","2022-07-27 17:25:45","2022-07-27 17:25:45","","012104 (8 pp.)","","","1022","","","","IOP Conf.

With Machine-Learning (ML) (a branch of Artificial Intelligence)algorithms, the interpretation of formation type from the log data has been addressed. As a result, we havesuccessfully developed a program able to accurately predict the type of formation. Using the conventional Machine Learning technique of splitting the data into training, validation andtest sets, we tried six different ML algorithms to fit with the training part of the data and then verifytheir prediction accuracy with cross-validation scores and cross-validation predictions which tests theperformance of the classifiers (ML algorithms) on the validation set. The three best performing classifierswere selected and further improved by a search of classifier's best hyperparameters. These improvedclassifiers are further tested on unseen data to produce a comparative analysis. Our prediction accuracy with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) scores and ROC-Area Under-the-Curve (ROC-AUC) for each type of formation from the log data lies in the range of 95-99%, exceptfor formations such as shaly sandstone and shale (50% and 84% respectively). The reason for this seemedto be under-fitting i.e., during the training, the classifiers did not see enough instances of these types offormation to know exactly what characteristics of the data make the type of formation to be shaly sandstoneor shale. The issue of under-fitting was verified by skimming through the data. To resolve this problem, we suggest training classifiers with a larger data with more targets (types of formation). Furthermore, during the data cleaning (prior to classifier training) and data analysis phases we have discovered importantrelationships between well logs and defined relative importance of each well log for different formations.This observation can be investigated further to help eliminate the use of multiple well logs while dealing withsome formations (based on prior geological knowledge) and reduce the cost of the well logging operations.Using our program with a larger well log data consisting of more formation type instances, we can train theclassifiers to accurately predict the formation type irrespectively of differences in formation type. Our program is dynamic in the sense that with different targets, i.e., type of formation fluid instead oftype of formation or both together, it can successfully predict either or both targets. Increasing the numbers of data instances resulted in a better training and thus, more accurate predictions. Utilization of the programwill make the formation-evaluation process easier, faster, automated and more-precise.

Quite often these data that are collected through sensible sensors can be anomalous due to different reasons such as systems breakdown, malfunctioning of sensor detectors, and more. Regardless of their root causes, such data severely affect the results of the subsequent analysis. This paper demonstrates data cleaning and preparation for time-series data and further proposes cost-sensitive machine learning algorithms as a solution to detect anomalous data points in a time-series data. The following models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines have been modified to support the cost-sensitive learning which penalizes misclassified samples thereby minimizing the total misclassification cost. Our results showed that Random Forest outperformed the rest of the models at predicting the positive class (i.e anomalies). Applying predictive model improvement techniques like data oversampling seem to provide little or no improvement to the Random Forest model. Interestingly, with recursive feature elimination we achieved a better model performance thereby reducing the dimensions in the data. Finally, with Influxdb and Kapacitor the data was ingested and streamed to generate new data points to further evaluate the model performance on unseen data, this will allow for early recognition of undesirable changes in the drinking water quality and will enable the water supply companies to rectify on a timely basis whatever undesirable changes abound.  2020, CC BY.","2020","2022-07-27 17:26:06","2022-07-27 17:26:06","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: arXiv","","","","Anomaly detection; Decision trees; Quality control; Python; Logistic regression; Random forests; Time series; Water quality; Support vector regression; Multilayer neural networks; Potable water; Water supply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA estimation is restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging patients (BA $\not \approx$ CA) from the given population. In this manner, we hypothesize that the remaining population should approximate the true BA behaviour. For this initial study, we apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients. A statistical and visualization-based analysis has provided evidence regarding the potential and current challenges of the proposed methodology.","2020-09-22","2022-07-27 17:26:06","2022-07-27 17:26:06","","10 pp.","","","","","arXiv","","arXiv (USA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: USA Publisher: arXiv","","","","neural nets; diseases; patient diagnosis; blood; medical image processing; biomedical MRI; brain; iterative methods; neurophysiology; cognition; paediatrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altogether we study four solutions, two domain-specific and two based on machine learning (ML). Concerning ER, we find that through ample data cleaning/extraction, simple matching rules can already achieve a high f1 score (0.921). However, we note the limited generalization power of such kind of solutions. For ML-ER, by reducing data cleaning/extraction, generic ML models resulted unsuccessful out of the box; but by increasing it, models resulted redundant compared to simple rules. For SM, we report less competitive f1 scores, establishing the need for more appropriate methods than those attempted. Based on our experience we confirm the importance of automating data cleaning/extraction as a goal towards general data integration methods that would be more portable across datasets. We venture that for highly heterogeneous schemas, a promising approach could be to evolve collective integration with ML & graph-based methods, incorporating strategies based on information propagation.

Application results of the Republican Photovoltaic Power Station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River indicate that the overall average prediction error of the proposed sunny photovoltaic power prediction model is 2%. Other methods used for PV power prediction such as linear regression, neural networks, and support vector machines have error detection intervals of 8%-20% under the same conditions.

A previous experiment was modified to include hyperparameter tuning with an autoML method for hyperparameters tuning. The data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering and time segmentation approach part of the experiment remained unchanged. With this approach, the correct impact on model performance by hyperparameter tuning can be measured on models that were carefully built. The results show improved performance especially for Decision Tree, Extra Tree, Random Forest Classifiers.

Insurance datasets are enormous, with skewed distributions and high dimensionality. Skewed class distribution and its volume are considered significant problems while analyzing insurance datasets, as these issues increase the misclassification rates. Although sampling approaches, such as random oversampling and SMOTE can help balance the data, they can also increase the computational complexity and lead to a deterioration of model's performance. So, more sophisticated techniques are needed to balance the skewed classes efficiently. This research focuses on optimizing the learner for fraud detection by applying a Fused Resampling and Cleaning Ensemble (FusedRCE) for effective sampling in health insurance fraud detection. We hypothesized that meticulous oversampling followed with a guided data cleaning would improve the prediction performance and learner's understanding of the minority fraudulent classes compared to other sampling techniques. The proposed model works in three steps. As a first step, PCA is applied to extract the necessary features and reduce the dimensions in the data. In the second step, a hybrid combination of k-means clustering and SMOTE oversampling is used to resample the imbalanced data. Oversampling introduces lots of noise in the data. A thorough cleaning is performed on the balanced data to remove the noisy samples generated during oversampling using the Tomek Link algorithm in the third step. Tomek Link algorithm clears the boundary between minority and majority class samples and makes the data more precise and freer from noise. The resultant dataset is used by four different classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks using repeated 5-fold cross-validation. Compared to other classifiers, Neural Networks with FusedRCE had the highest average prediction rate of 98.9%. The results were also measured using parameters such as F1 score, Precision, Recall and AUC values. The results obtained show that the proposed method performed significantly better than any other fraud detection approach in health insurance by predicting more fraudulent data with greater accuracy and a 3x increase in speed during training.  2020, Journal of Computing and Information Technology.

Equipment failure and human intervention are the main factors leading abnormal data of power curve, resulting in serious deterioration of the data availability. In order to solve the negative impact of abnormal data, a novel data cleaning framework is proposed for wind turbine systems. First, the nonlinear regression model between the wind speed and the power is established by the back propagation (BP) neural network. Then, the distances between the real data and the nonlinear regression model are approximated by employing the designed auxiliary points. The candidate abnormal data and the current normal data are separated by a threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in descending order. At the same time, based on the set of candidate abnormal data, the candidate normal data is selected through another threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in ascending order. On the basic of both the current normal data and the candidate normal data, the neural network based on iterative learning is applied to update the nonlinear regression model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified upon two sets of data collected by real wind turbine systems.","2021-05-22","2022-07-27 18:23:29","2022-07-31 03:01:44","","714-718","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601788; http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601788","Cleaning; Backpropagation; Deterioration; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Sorting; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; data cleaning; Training; Data models; neural network; Wind energy; wind power curve; Wind speed; Wind turbine system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
