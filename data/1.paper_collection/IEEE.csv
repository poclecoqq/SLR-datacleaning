It monitors voltage and current phasors of some buses and calculates voltage and current phasors of the other buses. At present, there is a two-ways energy flow in electric distribution grids due to the growth of distributed energy resources. So, there are many sources of error in $\mu\text{PMU}$ system data. In this paper, Pearson correlation is used with the help of a Binary Neural Network (BNN) classifier to detect the errors in $\mu\text{PMU}$ voltage measurements. Two BNNs are used in this paper. The first BNN is used to detect the injected error in the measured voltage magnitude. Meanwhile, the second BNN is used to detect the injected error in the measured voltage phase angle. The row sum of the correlation matrix is used as an input to BNN that indicates the weight of relation between a group of voltage measurements. The proposed method is tested for Assiut-university radial sub-feeder and the results showed a robust and an accurate performance for errors detection in $\mu\text{PMU}$ voltage measurements.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:05","2022-08-10 19:19:01","","569-574","","","","","","","22nd International Middle East Power Systems Conference, MEPCON 2021 - Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Assiut, Egypt","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MEPCON50283.2021.9686200","Neural networks; Error detection; Phasor measurement units; Correlation methods; Energy resources; Voltage measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to reduce the log-average miss rate of the object under different illumination conditions, a new one-stage detector suitable for multispectral pedestrian detection is proposed. First, in order to realize the complementarity between the information flows of the two modalities in the feature extraction stage to reduce the object loss, a low-cost cross-modality feature complementary module (CFCM) is proposed. Second, in order to suppress the background noise in different environments and enhance the semantic information and location information of the object, so as to reduce the error detection of the object, an attention-based feature enhancement fusion module (AFEFM) is proposed. Thirdly, through the feature complementarity of color-thermal image pair and the multi-scale fusion of depth feature layer, the horizontal and vertical multi-dimensional data mining of parallel deep neural network is realized, which provides effective data support for object detection algorithm. Finally, through the reasonable arrangement of proposed modules, a robust multispectral detection framework is proposed. The experimental results on the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) pedestrian benchmark show that the proposed method has the lowest log-average miss rate compared with other state-of-the-art multispectral pedestrian detectors, and has a good balance in speed and accuracy.  2013 IEEE.","2022","2022-08-10 17:40:40","2022-08-10 19:14:31","","53797-53809","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3175303","Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Data mining; Semantics; Extraction; Object detection; Object recognition; Job analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, welding errors are usually encountered during the welding process due to external factors. The detection and correct classification of these welding faults are of great importance for the reliability of the weld and the material which was welded. Traditionally, welding error detection is usually handed by visual inspection. However, visual inspection is an error-prone and slow process. In this study, an image processing and machine learning based method is proposed to automatically detect welding defects. The welded materials are divided into sub-images and each sub-image is examined for defect detection and defect type classification. The study has been examined in 2 aspects as 2-class classification and 3- class classification. As a result of the study, an average of 90% precision is obtained with Logistic Regression (LR) and 91% precision is obtained with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the 2-class classification process.

Most recent works show that visual information can boost the NER performance since images can provide complementary contextual information for texts. However, the image-level features ignore the mapping relations between fine-grained visual objects and textual entities, which results in error detection in entities with different types. To better exploit visual and textual information in NER, we propose an adversarial gated bilinear attention neural network (AGBAN). The model jointly extracts entity-related features from both visual objects and texts, and leverages an adversarial training to map two different representations into a shared representation. As a result, domain information contained in an image can be transferred and applied for extracting named entities in the text associated with the image. Experimental results on Tweets dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed gated bilinear attention network in capturing the interactions of mutimodal features visual objects and textual words. Our results indicate that the adversarial training can effectively exploit commonalities across heterogeneous data sources, which leads to improved performance in NER when compared to models purely exploiting text data or combining the image-level visual features.  1999-2012 IEEE.","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:34","2022-08-10 19:22:24","","2520-2532","","","23","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2020.3013398","Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Image enhancement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in domain adaptation. However, most of them leverage unlabeled target data only from a statistical perspective but neglect the analysis at the instance level. For better statistical alignment, existing approaches employ the entire unevaluated target data in an unsupervised manner, which may introduce noise and limit the discriminability of the neural networks. In this article, we propose confident learning-based domain adaptation (CLDA) to address the problem from a new perspective of data manipulation. To this end, a novel framework is presented to combine domain adaptation with confident learning (CL), where the former reduces the interdomain discrepancy and generates pseudo-labels for the target instances, from which the latter selects high-confidence target samples. Specifically, the confident learning part evaluates the confidence of each pseudo-labeled target sample based on the assigned labels and the predicted probabilities. Then, high-confidence target samples are selected as training data to increase the discriminative capacity of the neural networks. In addition, the domain adaptation part and the confident learning part are trained alternately to progressively increase the proportion of high-confidence labels in the target domain, thus further improving the accuracy of classification. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLDA method outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.

Its popularity has increased over the last few years due to the rising demand for machine learning systems usable by non-experts. Existing open-source systems fail to fully automate the machine learning tasks, being more like a black box that generates non-reusable pipelines. We propose an end-to-end system accessible to non-specialists and data scientists who wish to effortlessly create reusable and easy to understand pipelines for any regression and classification problems. The proposed solution increases the automation level by performing an advanced data cleaning followed by a complete feature engineering process without any domain knowledge about the data set. These processes are integrated into a search that generates for each model the optimum instance of preprocessed data. Bayesian optimization (BO) with a Gaussian process (GP) maximizes the performance of these models that will be ensembled using standard and probability-based stacking.

However, in some application domains, it is difficult to apply machine learning methods to solve the new arising problems due to the lack of standardized and annotated datasets. People have to find their way from the very beginning of the data collecting, cleaning, and labeling. Unfortunately, there is not a guiding framework to deal with such a situation. This paper pays attention to it and proposes a general machine learning framework to solve the pratical problems from the scratch. It contains two main stages implemented by an unsupervised clustering method and a semi-supervised learning method representatively. In the first stage, an unsupervised clustering method is utilized to find representative data samples which are more important and can be used to do data cleaning and manual labeling. In the second stage, a semi-supervised method is adopted to predict the labels for the rest data samples and to construct a larger annotated dataset. A case study in the texture perception field has been done to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed application framework.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:04","2022-07-30 22:30:22","","393-397","","","","","","","2021 6th International Conference on Image, Vision and Computing, ICIVC 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Qingdao, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIVC52351.2021.9526959","Deep learning; Large dataset; Benchmarking; Supervised learning; Speech recognition; Cluster analysis; Computer vision; machine learning; Computational modeling; Manuals; Clustering methods; Textures; application framework; semi-supervised; Semisupervised learning; texture perception; unsupervised","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:06","2022-07-31 14:18:07","","16153-16164","","21","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016297","Big data; Cleaning; Deep learning; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Feature extraction; Health care; Internet of things; feature selection; Internet of Things; Training; Correlation; Deep Q-network (DQN); multisourced data; Mutual information; reinforcement learning; Smart cities; ALGORITHM; ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY; MUTUAL INFORMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a new method to solve the problem of image with label noise and background noise in weakly supervised learning, which can clean the wrong image with label noise and background noise.

The images screened in this part include images with 40%-60% label noise and background noise. It can effectively reduce the screening range of the wrong image. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in the dataset of cat and dog dichoromy in the public dataset.

Acquiring massive high-quality labeled data from experts is often infeasible. Unfortunately, without sufficient high-quality pixel-level labels, the usual data-driven learning-based segmentation methods often struggle with deficient training. As a result, we are often forced to collect additional labeled data from multiple sources with varying label qualities. However, directly introducing additional data with low-quality noisy labels may mislead the network training and undesirably offset the efficacy provided by those high-quality labels. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Teacher-assisted Confident Learning (MTCL) framework constructed by a teacher-student architecture and a label self-denoising process to robustly learn segmentation from a small set of high-quality labeled data and plentiful low-quality noisy labeled data. Particularly, such a synergistic framework is capable of simultaneously and robustly exploiting (i) the additional dark knowledge inside the images of low-quality labeled set via perturbation-based unsupervised consistency, and (ii) the productive information of their low-quality noisy labels via explicit label refinement. Comprehensive experiments on left atrium segmentation with simulated noisy labels and hepatic and retinal vessel segmentation with real-world noisy labels demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of our approach as well as its effectiveness on label denoising.

The results show that the feature selection method proposed in this paper can greatly impove the accuracy and recall rate of each model, and the logisitc regression model has a strong comprehensive ability.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:08","2022-07-31 02:39:43","","21-26","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2021 International Conference on Intelligent Computing, Automation and Applications, ICAA 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Nanjing, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICAA53760.2021.00012","Machine learning; Support vector machines; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Statistical tests; Analytical models; Training; Computational modeling; Correlation; Radio frequency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This paper presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs. Evaluated using eleven popular adversarial attacks and two representative out-of-distribution datasets, we show that XEnsemble achieves a high defense success rate against adversarial examples and a high detection success rate against out-of-distribution data inputs, and outperforms existing representative defense methods with respect to robustness and defensibility.

The products on any e commerce websites have thousands of reviews which helps customers to make a decision a product. Social media websites also have people with large number of opinions on a particular subject. Mining of opinions can be extensively used in the fields where opinions play a major role. This project caters to this need and classifies the opinions of people as positive and negative. This can further be used by movie recommendation systems and e commerce websites for evaluation of their product. It involved in the classification the opinions as positive opinions and negative opinions with the help of deep learning algorithms by achieving high accuracy. The procedures involved in this project will be of dataset selection, data preprocessing, data tokenization, and data cleansing and building a neural network. We have taken the dataset of reviews for this purpose. Data preprocessing and data cleansing is done so that deep learning algorithms can be easily applied on the data. Deep learning algorithms learn on their own and do not require guidance. The main objective of using deep learning model is for increasing efficiency, performance and accuracy. Here, we have applied three different neural network models to our dataset and compare the performances according to the testing and training accuracy obtained. Analysis of the three models concludes that Recurrent Neural Model (RNN) has least over fitting with considerable testing and training accuracy.

In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CORDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CORDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CORDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2% on public benchmark datasets. Moreover, CORDEL yields a 2.4% improvement over the current best DL model on the real-world dataset, while reducing the number of training parameters by 97.6%. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Machine learning applications are not limited to autonomous cars or robotics but are widely used in almost all sectors including finance, healthcare, entertainment, government systems, telecommunications, and many others. Due to a lack of enterprise ML strategy, many enterprises still repeat the tedious steps and spend most of the time massaging the required data. It is easier to access a variety of data because of big data lakes and data democratization. Despite it and decent advances in ML, engineers still spend significant time in data cleansing and feature engineering. Most of the steps are often repeated in this exercise. As a result, it generates identical features with variations that lead to inconsistent results in testing and training ML applications. It often stretches the time to go-live and increases the number of iterations to ship a final ML application. Sharing the best practices and best features are not only time-savers but they also help to jumpstart ML application development. The democratization of ML features is a powerful way to share useful features, to reduce time go-live, and to enable rapid ML application development.

This research's main objective is to explore air quality from 2010 to 2018 in metropolitan zones of Guadalajara, Monterrey, and the Valley of Mexico. Air quality is analyzed based on the concentrations of criteria pollutants: Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In this paper, six stages are proposed:1) data collection; 2) data cleansing; 3) descriptive analysis. 4) design of cluster analysis models and main components; 5) application of machine learning models; 6) interpretation and analysis of results. This study has concluded that higher mean hourly concentrations for pollutants, CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and SO2 were found in Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone. In contrast, the highest mean hourly concentration of PM10 was found in the Monterrey Metropolitan Zone. Furthermore, the pollutant with the highest effect in the three critical zones was PM2.5, presenting high concentrations with hazardous air quality levels. Finally, the area with the worst air quality was Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:09:10","2022-07-31 02:13:24","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE International Conference on Engineering Veracruz, ICEV 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Blvd. Adolfo Ruiz Cortines #455, Boca del Rao, Veracruz, 24292, Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEV50249.2020.9289674","Machine learning; Air quality; Analytical models; Data models; Atmospheric modeling; cluster analysis; criteria pollutants; Micrometers; principal components analysis; Sulfur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in machine learning techniques have allowed researchers to make substantial gains in tackling complex problems in diverse fields such as medical diagnosis through image analysis, object detection and tracking, and natural language processing. However, often researchers only employ one or two machine learning algorithms with a static feature set while only testing a single hypothesis. This self-imposed bottleneck often produces suboptimal results because it arises from using machine learning within the classical, algorithmic context using existing development tools. Therefore, there is a need to create new development tools which reflect this change to the machine learning paradigm. In this research, we propose a development environment that allows researchers to leverage those capabilities more fully by shifting not only the tool they use but also their mindset. Our proposed environment serves as an intermediate tool, guiding the researcher and making full adoption of the machine learning paradigm throughout the software development process easier. To accomplish this, our framework is defined by a three-layer structure designed for subject domain assessment, data manipulation and feature set exploration. Supported by parallelism, data cleaning and feature engineering, this research provides a conceptual basis for future creation of development environments for the machine learning paradigm. Future development of such a conceptual design would allow for additional intelligent tools to aid the user in designing solutions and support reusability at the design level.  2022 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:10","2022-07-30 22:28:49","","329-331","","","2022-March","","","","Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Mobile, AL, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SoutheastCon48659.2022.9764094","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Software design; Diagnosis; Natural language processing systems; Medical imaging; Object detection; machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Software; Focusing; Natural language processing; Reusability; development environment; Parallel processing; software development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, co-occurrence bias in the training dataset may hamper a DNNmodel's generalizabil- ity to unseen scenarios in the real world. For example, in COCO [26], many object categories have a much higher cooccurrence with men compared to women, which can bias a DNN's prediction in favor of men. Recent works have focused on task-specific training strategies to handle bias in such scenarios, but fixing the available data is often ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel and more generic solution to address the contextual bias in the datasets by selecting a subset of the samples, which is fair in terms of the co-occurrence with various classes for a protected attribute. We introduce a data repair algorithm using the coefficient of variation( cv), which can curate fair and contextually balanced data for a protected class(es). This helps in training a fair model irrespective of the task, architecture or training methodology. Our proposed solution is simple, effective and can even be used in an active learning setting where the data labels are not present or being generated incrementally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of object detection and multi-label image classification across different datasets. Through a series of experiments, we validate that curating contextually fair data helps make model predictions fair by balancing the true positive rate for the protected class across groups without compromising on the model's overall performance.

It has the ability to be one of the most dangerous things humans have ever experienced. It damages livestock, crops, and forests, among other things. To avoid this issue in mostly urban areas, the popular approach such as machine learning techniques may be used to predict air quality from contaminants. As a consequence, the quality of the air assessment and forecasting has become an important field of study. The goal is to develop machine learning-based air quality forecasting techniques that are as accurate as possible. The supervised machine learning technique (SMLT) will be used to gather several pieces of information from the dataset, including variable recognition, uni-variate analysis, bi-variate and multi-variate analysis, missing value treatment and analysis, data cleaning/preparation, and data representation. Our findings provide a valuable guide to sensitivity analysis of model parameters in terms of success in air quality pollution prediction through accuracy measurement. By comparing supervise classification machine learning algorithms and generating prediction results in the form of best accuracy, create a machine learning-based method for accurately predicting the Air Quality Index value. Furthermore, to compare and discuss various machine learning algorithms in order to determine the most accurate algorithm with the performance of a GUI-based user interface for air quality prediction. Motivation: The aim is to create a machine learning model for realtime air quality forecasting that can potentially replace updatable supervised machine learning classification models by predicting best accuracy by comparing supervised algorithms. The aim of this project is to use machine learning to investigate a dataset of air pollutants records for the Indian meteorological sector. It is more difficult to determine air quality. This research work attempts to reduce the risk factor associated with forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) of India to a safe human level in order to save a significant amount of meteorological time and resources, as well as to predict whether the air quality is bad or good.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:11","2022-07-31 04:00:06","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems, ICCES 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Coimbatre, India","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCES51350.2021.9488983","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Artificial intelligence; Recurrent neural networks; Quality control; Forecasting; Supervised learning; Turing machines; Agriculture; Air quality; Sensitivity analysis; Training; Predictive models; Air Quality Prediction; Atmospheric measurements; Atmospheric modeling; Bidirectional recurrent neural network; Classification Model; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Defect layer identification is a labor-intensive task that requires domain knowledge of experts to make consistent decisions over multiple datasets. Sometimes, it also requires examining multiple sources of inspection images to make the final identification. In this paper, we propose a multimodal machine learning model for defect layer identification as a classification problem from multiple sources of input images. After training two single modal models from each input source, we develop a final joint fusion model to achieve the best classification performance. This work also demonstrates how to estimate the final fusion model performance without exhaustively trying all possible combinations of single modal models. In order to integrate the approach into an industrial display manufacturing defect data analytic, we propose the data coverage model, which guarantees human-level classification performance within a certain portion of data. The data coverage model improves the robustness of the multimodal model, utilizing confident learning to make a high-confidence predictions for the particle defect layer identification and adding a filter to assess whether data samples are within the coverage based on the model's latent space density estimation. This work uses particle defects data samples in 8 different layers as a combination of TEM and STEM images from display manufacturing fabrication lines. Our experimental results show that the classification accuracy improves substantially by deploying the proposed multimodal model. The results also show that it is possible to implement the data coverage model to achieve the human expert level of defect layer classification for a portion of data to automate the task.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 03:18:07","","","","","2021-May","","","","ASMC (Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference) Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Milpitas, CA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASMC51741.2021.9435664","Machine learning; Process control; Semiconductor device manufacture; Defects; Analytical models; Training; Predictive models; Image processing; Data coverage model; Display defect layer classification; Fabrication; Multimodal machine learning; Semiconductor device modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better protect and treat higher risk individuals and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems, it is crucial to identify risk factors and build accurate predictive models for COVID-19 related health outcomes. However, current predictive models focus on predicting the risk of mortality, and rely on COVID-19 specific medical data such as CT scans and COVID-19 lab tests results after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. To address these issues, we developed an innovative supervised machine learning framework using synthetic veteran Electronic Health Records (EHR) which were routinely collected during past clinic visits. Our models accurately predicted COVID-19 related health outcomes including mortality, ventilation, days in hospital or ICU. In particular, we developed a series of unique and effective data processing algorithms, including data cleaning, vector representation, initial feature screening. Then we trained models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies combined with different parameter settings. Our machine learning pipeline not only consistently outperformed those developed by other research groups using the same set of EHR, but also achieved similar accuracy as those trained on medical data that were only available after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, top risk factors for COVID-19 were identified, which include age, diabetes, metabolic syndromes, heart disease, kidney disease etc., and are consistent with epidemiology findings. Built on veteran's EHR, our results were especially relevant to veterans and filled in the gap of missing COVID-19 research for veterans who are at much higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness than the general population. This project also demonstrated that longitudinal EHR data can be successfully leveraged to provide a holistic prediction of an individual's health risk based on past health records, which is critical for controlling emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:38","2022-07-31 01:54:21","","519-526","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2021 IEEE 9th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, ISCHI 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Victoria, BC, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00099","Data handling; Machine learning; Pipelines; Computerized tomography; E-learning; Forecasting; Diseases; Diagnosis; Records management; Supervised learning; Heart; Health risks; machine learning; Predictive models; COVID-19; Medical services; COVID-19 predictive model; electronic health record; Infectious diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has a significant impact on a broad range of applications that are characterized by massive working sets and real-time constraints. However, it is challenging and burdensome for human operators to hand-tune various control-knobs in a cloud-scale storage cluster for maintaining optimal performance under diverse workload conditions. Our study on an open-source object-based storage system, Ceph, shows that common load balancing strategies are ineffective unless they are adapted according to workload characteristics. Furthermore, positive effects of an applied strategy may not be immediately visible. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning based system adaptation technique that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks. In particular, we applied a stochastic policy gradient based reinforcement learning technique to track performance hotspots in the storage cluster, and take appropriate corrective actions to maximize future performance under a variety of complex scenarios. For this purpose, we leveraged system-level performance monitoring and commonly available control-knobs in object-based cloud storage systems. We implemented the developed techniques to build an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) system for object based storage cluster, and evaluated its performance on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed. Experiments using Cloud Object Storage Benchmark (COSBench) show that, ARM improves the average read and write response time of Ceph storage cluster by upto 50% and 33% respectively, compared to the default case. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic load rebalancing technique in terms of read and write performance of Ceph storage by 43% and 36% respectively.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-31 03:53:28","","34-44","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Prague, Czech republic","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IC2E.2019.000-9","Open systems; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Cloud computing; Stochastic systems; Digital storage; Information management; Balancing; Dynamic loads; Knobs; Storage as a service (STaaS); Storage management; Task analysis; Hardware; Servers; Interference; Ceph; Cloud Storage; Load management; Performance Interference; Reinforcement Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we use the systematic sampling method to obtain Douban's social media data. Because there are many abnormal users in these data, they are real but false data for personal credit evaluation. In order to better carry out personal credit scoring, we propose three criteria, power exponents of time interval distribution of individual user i, user activity Ai, and the ratio of out-degree and in-degree Ri of user i, which are used to systematically clean the data. And then, we used the logistic regression method to score the individual credits of users before and after data cleaning, and found that the rank order of personal credit scoring has changed significantly. This change is largely attributed to the changes of network structure after data cleaning. We believe that our work is very important to use the social media data to establish a credible personal credit evaluation system to reduce the credit risk of the current Internet financial industry.  2001-2011 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-31 03:01:36","","7-15","","2","35","","IEEE Intelligent Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2020.2972214","Cleaning; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Social networking (online); Logistic regression; Risk assessment; Intelligent systems; Data cleaning; Data models; Personal credit scoring; Power-law distribution; Social media data; User activity; COMMUNICATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As many enterprises are trying to step up machine learning applications, it is critical to have a long-term strategy. Most of the enterprises are not able to truly realize the fruits of ML capabilities due to its complexity. It is easier to access a variety of data today due to data democratization, distributed storage, technological advancements, and big data applications. Despite easier data access and recent advancements in ML, developers still spend most of the time in data cleansing, data preparation, and data modeling for ML applications. These steps are often repeated and result in identical features. As identical features can have inconsistent processing while testing and training, more issues pop up at later stages in ML application development. The unification of ML features is an effective way to address these issues.

Security information and event management systems (SIEMs) perform some rudimentary automation but cannot replicate the decision-making process of a skilled analyst. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can detect patterns in data with appropriate training. In practice, the majority of the alert data comprises false alerts, and true alerts form only a small proportion. Consequently, a naive engine that classifies all security alerts into the majority class can yield a superficial high accuracy close to 100%. Without any correction for the class imbalance, the false alerts will dominate algorithmic predictions resulting in poor generalization performance. We propose a machine-learning approach to address the class imbalance problem in multi-appliance security alert data and automate the security alert analysis process performed in security operations centers (SOCs). We first used the neighborhood cleaning rule (NCR) to identify and remove ambiguous, noisy, and redundant false alerts. Then, we applied the support vector machine synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVMSMOTE) to generate synthetic training true alerts. Finally, we fit and evaluated the decision tree and random forest classifiers. In the experiments, using alert data from eight security appliances, we demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly reduce the need for manual auditing, decreasing the number of uninspected alerts and achieving a performance of 99.524% in recall.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-30 22:36:25","","2119-2127","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671956","Cleaning; Automation; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Information management; Random forests; Intrusion detection; Big Data; machine learning; data cleaning; Training; Noise measurement; Security; alert fatigue; alert screening; Class imbalance; oversampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an attempt to guarantee data quality, various data cleaning approaches have been proposed to filter out abnormal data entries based on the global data distribution. However, most existing data cleaning approaches are based on a centralized paradigm and thus cannot be applied to future edge-based IoT applications, where each edge node (EN) has only a limited view of the global data distribution. Moreover, the increasing demand for privacy preservation largely prevents ENs from combining their data for centralized cleaning. In this study, we propose a federated data cleaning protocol, coined as FedClean, for edge intelligence (EI) scenarios that is designed to achieve data cleaning without compromising data privacy. More specifically, different ENs first generate Boolean shares of their data and distribute them to two noncolluding servers. These two servers then run the FedClean protocol to privately and efficiently compute the attribute value frequency (AVF) scores of the collected data entries, which are then sorted in ascending order via a bitonic sorting network without revealing their values. As a result, data entries with lower AVF scores are considered as abnormal and filtered out. The security, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are then demonstrated via concrete security analysis and comprehensive experiments.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:40","2022-07-31 03:14:09","","6757-6770","","8","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3027980","Cleaning; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Internet of Things; Data privacy; Data cleaning; Data models; Collaboration; edge intelligence (EI); privacy preserving; Protocols; Servers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part of the data preparation, standardization, and cleaning processes, such as data matching and deduplication for instance, could be automated by making a ML model 'learn' and predict the matches routinely. Data integration can also benefit from ML as the data to be integrated can be sampled and used to design the data integration algorithms. After the initial manual work to setup the labels, ML models can start learning from the new incoming data that are being submitted for standardization, integration, and cleaning. The more data supplied to the model, the better the ML algorithm can perform and deliver accurate results. Therefore, ML is more scalable compared to traditional and time-consuming approaches. Nevertheless, many ML algorithms require an out-of-The-box tuning and their parameters and scope are often not adapted to the problem at hand. To make an example, in cleaning and integration processes, the window sizes of values used for the ML models cannot be arbitrarily chosen and require an adaptation of the learning parameters.

This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture morphological information in their representation. Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: Scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: A Gamma-Poisson matrix factorizationon substring counts, and a min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: If scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.  2020 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:18","2022-07-31 03:06:00","","1164-1176","","3","34","","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2020.2992529","Cleaning; Machine learning; Factorization; Semantics; Signal encoding; Encoding (symbols); Data models; Encoding; Statistical analysis; autoML; Gamma-Poisson factorization; interpretable machine learning; large-scale data; min-hash; Natural language processing; Statistical learning; string categorical variables; ALGORITHMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bot-IoT is modern, publicly available, and covers a wide range of botnet attack traffic in IoT networks. Out of the roughly 73,000,000 instances contained in this dataset, only about 0.013% represents normal traffic, which indicates that the issue of class imbalance should not be ignored for Bot-IoT. Our contribution includes several important findings based on works that address the imbalance in this dataset. In general, we noted the excellent performance of a diverse range of trained models. This suggests Bot-IoT is a reliable dataset that is relatively easy to classify. We also observed that information on data cleaning was left out in a few papers, thus making it challenging for outside researchers to reproduce experiments from these works.

We introduce the concept of a Data Readiness Report as accompanying documentation to a dataset that allows data consumers to get detailed insights into the quality of data. Data characteristics and challenges on various quality dimensions are identified and documented, keeping in mind the principles of transparency and explainability. The Data Readiness Report also serves as a record of all data assessment operations, including applied transformations. This provides a detailed lineage for data governance and management. In effect, the report captures and documents the actions taken by various personas in a data readiness and assessment workflow. Over time this becomes a repository of best practices and can potentially drive a recommendation system for building automated data readiness workflows on the lines of AutoML [1].

This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards.

A number of illustrative applications of the developed tool are discussed, particularly for the detection of ""R""peaks from electrocardiogram signals. While algorithms for detection of ""R""peaks can achieve good results when applied to an electrocardiogram signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio, they often lead to incorrect detections in the presence of noise or motion artifact commonly found in clinical setups. In such cases, the Time Series Event Annotator (TSEA) enables efficient imputing of missed or incorrect ""R""peak detections, leading to increased data integrity for downstream analysis, at minimum cost.

In BNAS, the single-path sampling-updating strategy of an overparameterized BCNN leads to terrible unfair training issue, which restricts the efficiency improvement. To mitigate the unfair training issue, we employ a continuous relaxation strategy to optimize all paths of the overparameterized BCNN simultaneously. However, continuous relaxation leads to a performance collapse issue that leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned BCNN. For that, we propose the confident learning rate (CLR) and introduce the combination of partial channel connections and edge normalization. Experimental results show that 1) BNAS-v2 delivers state-of-the-art search efficiency on both CIFAR-10 (0.05 GPU days, which is 4x faster than BNAS) and ImageNet (0.19 GPU days) with better or competitive performance; 2) the above two solutions are effectively alleviating the performance collapse issue; and 3) BNAS-v2 achieves powerful generalization ability on multiple transfer tasks, e.g., MNIST, FashionMNIST, NORB, and SVHN.

A case study is conducted with real consumption data from residential, commercial, and industrial consumers to show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method for load profiling. After the data cleansing, filtering, and normalization processes, the input dataset is divided into several clusters based on their profile differences. Later, various results are obtained to reflect different consumption patterns within a profile group by the selected distance measurement methods such as Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping. The results obtained in the case study show that the proposed mathematical algorithm can be used to create realistic and scalable profiling subgroups (with percentages of similar consumptions in each cluster) instead of the traditional methods which cluster all profiles in a single big cluster. The proposed algorithm is used for a case study of Turkey; however, this study is adaptable to other European markets.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:23","2022-07-31 05:37:05","","","","","2020-September","","","","International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Stockholm, Sweden","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EEM49802.2020.9221889","Learning systems; Clustering algorithms; Time series analysis; Hierarchical clustering; Unsupervised learning; Power markets; Heuristic algorithms; clustering; Couplings; Companies; Clustering methods; consumption; Europe; load profiling; market settlement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such multi-source heterogenous data typically contain low-quality data, e.g., missing values, which may result in potential risks. Besides, resource-constrained devices incur large latency in edge computing networks. To alleviate such latency, distributed task offloading schemes are designed to share the computation burden between edge nodes and nearby servers. However, there are three main drawbacks of such schemes. First, low-quality data are not carefully evaluated by constraints under scenarios, which may result in slow convergence in distributed computation. Second, multi-source data including sensitive information are computed and shared among edge nodes without privacy protection. Third, distributed tasks on low-quality data may result in low-quality results even with an optimal offloading scheme. To address the problems above, a task offloading framework for edge computing based on consortium blockchain and distributed reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which can provide high-quality task offloading policies with data privacy protected. This framework consists of three key components: data quality evaluation (DQ) with multiple data quality dimensions, data repairing (DR) with a repairing algorithm based on a novel repairing consensus mechanism and distributed reinforcement learning for task arrangement (DELTA) with a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm based on a novel low-quality data distributing strategy. Numeric results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed task offloading framework for edge computing on low-quality data in the IoE.  1983-2012 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:24","2022-07-31 14:42:37","","657-676","","2","40","","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3118417","Repair; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Quality control; Blockchain; Edge computing; Data privacy; Task analysis; Data integrity; Blockchains; consortium blockchain; data quality; distributed learning; Internet of energy; Organizations; task offloading; ALLOCATION; IOT; RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION; THINGS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:24","2022-07-31 02:37:08","","4 pp.","","","","","","","2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp).

Precise ETA prediction is the core element of Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) system, which is intended to improve the real-time airport gate assignment, reduce runway intrusion risk and cut down waiting time for ground maintenance vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model to address ETA prediction problem by application of supervised learning methods based on multisource data. The proposed model consists of two parts: spatiotemporal trajectories storage and clustering-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering, re-sampling and data storage, we increase the dimension of trajectory variable. Then, the discrete track points are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using real-time data cross validation, the model is trained to find out the different prediction factor of ETA for each individual cluster cell under various conditions. Finally, the predicted ETA for each flight is generated. Lots of validation work has been approached with this model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method based on spatiotemporal data analysis is the most effective and accurate.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been considered as a feasible solution to cope with the complexity of the orchestration of fog devices. Nevertheless, the use of an SDN controller introduces delays into the transport of packet flows in the fog layer, which may impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications in the continuum IoT-Fog-Cloud. In this paper, we propose a regression model for predicting delay values in an SDN-based fog layer. To build up the regression model, we constructed a dataset, performed data cleaning, carried out feature selection, and applied different Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Our evaluation results reveal that the Random Forest (RF) technique overperforms Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN) techniques on predicting the delay in an SDN-based fog layer. Furthermore, the predicted delay values reinforce that a fog layer based on SDN can support different latency-sensitive applications.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:25","2022-07-31 03:04:49","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2019 - Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Waikoloa, HI, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013980","Cleaning; Machine learning; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Internet of things; Multilayer neural networks; Internet of Things; Fog; Fog computing; Quality of service; Software defined networking; Data models; Predictive models; Machine Learning; Delay estimation; Delay; Fog Computing; Knowledge-Defined Networking; Quality of Service; Software-Defined Networking; WORKLOAD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenges of this entity resolution task that demand so much research attention are often rooted in the task-specificity and user-dependence of the process. Adopting deep learning techniques has the potential to lessen these challenges. In this paper, we set out to devise an entity resolution method that builds on the robustness conferred by deep autoencoders to reduce human-involvement costs. Specifically, we reduce the cost of training deep entity resolution models by performing unsupervised representation learning. This unveils a transferability property of the resulting model that can further reduce the cost of applying the approach to new datasets by means of transfer learning. Finally, we reduce the cost of labeling training data through an active learning approach that builds on the properties conferred by the use of deep autoencoders.

We introduce a paradigm called Trusted Machine Learning (TML) for making ML models more trustworthy. We use Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as the underlying dynamical model and outline three TML approaches: (1) Model Repair, wherein we modify the learned model directly; (2) Data Repair, wherein we modify the data so that re-learning from the modified data results in a trusted model; and (3) Reward Repair, wherein we modify the reward function of the MDP to satisfy the specified logical constraint.

However, wireless enterprise networks are more vulnerable than wired networks because of the broadcast feature.

Additionally, effectively detecting the attacks in the wireless enterprise networks is one of todays most important and challenging problems, especially in Wi-Fi networks, as attacks become increasingly covert and diverse. Fortunately, WiFi networks produce large amounts of data, providing copious big data for researchers. In this paper, using the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID), which is derived from the real-world Wi-Fi network, we introduce machine learning to detect network attacks.

A large corpus of high-quality query and code pairs is demanded to establish a precise mapping from the natural language to the programming language. Due to the limited availability, most widely-used code search datasets are established with compromise, such as using code comments as a replacement of queries. Our empirical study on a famous code search dataset reveals that over one-third of its queries contain noises that make them deviate from natural user queries. Models trained through noisy data are faced with severe performance degradation when applied in real-world scenarios. To improve the dataset quality and make the queries of its samples semantically identical to real user queries is critical for the practical usability of neural code search. In this paper, we propose a data cleaning framework consisting of two subsequent filters: a rule-based syntactic filter and a model-based semantic filter. This is the first framework that applies semantic query cleaning to code search datasets. Experimentally, we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework on two widely-used code search models and three manually-annotated code retrieval benchmarks.

Researchers using machine learning often apply some data cleaning techniques to clean up corrupted data.

Our work proposes a data cleaning method based on ACGAN since it is difficult to manually formulate cleaning rules, and there are often no positive samples of training data too. Our work does not need to artificially add cleaning rules or positive samples, and subtly uses mode dropping of GAN to eliminate the impact of noisy labels on corrupted data so which can be converted to relatively clean synthetic training data.

Noise parameters are used to vary the total level of class noise and the proportion of class noise between the majority and minority classes. This allows us to better understand how class noise affects imbalanced data sets and where data cleaning efforts should be focused. Four popular machine learning algorithms are evaluated using six rounds of five-fold cross-validation to determine which learners are most robust to class noise. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) results shows that negative class noise, i.e. when positive instances are incorrectly labeled as negative, has the greatest adverse effect on classification performance. Statistical results show that the XGBoost learner performs significantly better than Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression Learners.

However, with the development of the times, there are more and more users, and more and more data can be collected, which has caused a certain degree of difficulty in user classification. User classification has always been one of the key researches in all walks of life. As one of the classic algorithms in unsupervised learning, the K-means clustering method has a good clustering effect on unlabeled data. According to the characteristics of the electricity consumption data of electricity market users, this paper proposes a user classification model based on K-means clustering algorithms. Firstly, it selects the median and 3 criterion to complete the missing values and clean up the abnormal values of the original electricity consumption data. Then use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and finally use the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the processed data. Through clustering, the users are divided into different clusters, each cluster is equivalent to a user group, and at the same time extract, the typical users of this user group are the representatives of this user category. The model is verified through the analysis of calculation examples, and the experimental results show that the classification of power users based on the K-means clustering algorithm is very effective.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:31","2022-07-31 04:37:47","","385-390","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2021 3rd International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data and Business Intelligence, MLBDBI 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Online, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MLBDBI54094.2021.00079","Machine learning; Clustering algorithms; Electric power utilization; Principal component analysis; K-means clustering; Cluster analysis; Electric industry; Power markets; Data Cleaning; Machine Learning; Classification algorithms; Data Analysis; Market research; K-means; Electricity Market; User Classification; Electricity supply industry; Power supplies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The typical practice is to create 'clean' data for analysis, matching entities and merging variants to overcome differences in knowledge representation. Despite progress in data management techniques to automate this process, it still needs labor-intensive supervision from the analyst. In this paper, we evaluate the benefit of advanced statistical tools to address directly many analytic tasks across data sources without such entity-matching cleaning. Reframing analytical questions as machine-learning tasks enables to replace exact matching of entities by continuous descriptions-vectorial embeddings- that expose similarities between entries. But are analyses with less cleaning trustworthy? We answer this question with a thorough benchmark on questions typical of socio-economic studies across 14 employee databases: we compare the approaches based on machine learning to manual data cleaning (entity matching). It reveals that using embeddings and machine learning improves results validity (smaller estimation error) more than manual cleaning, with considerably less human labor. While machine learning is often combined with data management for the purpose of cleaning, our study suggests that using it directly for analysis is beneficial because it captures ambiguities hard to represent during curation.  2013 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:31","2022-07-31 03:31:02","","42420-42431","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168013","Cleaning; Machine learning; Data integration; Embeddings; Information analysis; Job analysis; Statistical mechanics; data integration; data cleaning; Sociology; Task analysis; Manuals; Data analysis; embeddings; entity-matching; Remuneration; Soft sensors; DATA INTEGRATION; DETERMINANTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, odometer is inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices and smartphones. To apply forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Dedicated experiments have been conducted to verify the generalization capability and the precision of the OdoNet. The results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet, while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Hence, a data-cleaning procedure is adopted to effectively mitigate the impacts of the IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the processing mode using only non-holonomic constraint (NHC), by employing the pseudo-odometer, the positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74% for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation.

The renewable energy accommodation is one of the key issues to achieve the energy efficiency in smart grid, which is difficult to obtain dynamic optimal policies due to the intermittency of renewables. To capture statuses of renewable energy for decision-making, large amounts of information in heterogeneous forms are collected by massive end devices deployed in smart grid. Such information not only provides fruitful features for existing learning based algorithms but also incurs high computation complexity. Besides, such heterogeneous data may also contain missing values, which may result in wrong policies by existing algorithms. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge-end orchestrated computing scheme is proposed to efficiently repair missing values and obtain optimal policies in two separate layers. In the first layer, deep learning based algorithms deployed can perceive the characteristics and repair the missing values. In the second layer, deep reinforcement learning based algorithms are employed to obtain optimal policies. Simulations on the real power grid dataset illustrate the effectiveness of proposed fault-tolerant renewable energy accommodation algorithm.

To help solve this issue, researchers have proposed various methods to suggest the sequence of APIs given natural language queries representing the information needs from programmers. Among such efforts, Gu et al. adopted a deep learning method, in particular an RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture, to perform this task and obtained promising results on common APIs in Java. In this work, we aim to reproduce their results and apply the same methods for APIs in Python. Additionally, we compare the performance with a more recent Transformer-based method, i.e., CodeBERT, for the same task. Our experiment reveals a clear drop in performance measures when careful data cleaning is performed. Owing to the pretraining from a large number of source code files and effective encoding technique, CodeBERT outperforms the method by Gu et al., to a large extent. Copyright  2022, The Authors.

Moreover, the comparisons have been carried out in the cases with and without deviation standardization for each algorithm, and the results demonstrate that the deviation standardization has a certain effect on the accuracy improvement. Additionally, it is found that the random forest algorithm can present the ranking of the features in order of importance.

Such process of information mining should be built on the basis of pre-processing, including data cleaning, aligning, segmentation and so on. In this paper, we mainly focus on an efficient algorithm to accurately segment time sequences in hydrology domain. Although traditional methods of time series segmentation can segment time series easily, there are three drawbacks in traditional methods; First, traditional segmentation methods pay more attention to the evaluation of the compression ratio and the fitting rate, but ignore the accuracy of segmentation points; Secondly, traditional segmentation methods do not take the information of time series data itself into account, such as it is easy to divide a whole time series into two time series segments, which leads to losing semantic information in time series analysis. Finally, in these traditional evaluations of time series segmentation, the number of segments and the position of the segmentation points are not comprehensively taken into account. In this paper, we propose a time series segmentation method based on Bi-LG-LSTM neural network, which is modified on the base of the LSTM/Bi-LSTM neural network. Through the supervised learning method on flood flow data sets, we can extract a large number of effective segments of the time series. Meanwhile, we propose a novel evaluation method, which utilizes the dynamic DTW distance method to evaluate the results of the time series segmentation method. The evaluation method takes the position of segmentation points and the number of time series segments into consideration. Experiments on the flood flow time series show that our proposed method has an obvious effect.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:35","2022-07-31 03:57:34","","162-169","","","","","","","2020 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics, ICCCBDA 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Chengdu, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCCBDA49378.2020.9095566","Long short-term memory; Big data; Cleaning; Data handling; Learning systems; Neural networks; Cloud computing; Feature extraction; Advanced Analytics; Data mining; Semantics; Time series analysis; Data compression ratio; Floods; Bi-LG-LSTM; flood flow time series; intelligent data processing; Logic gates; Microsoft Windows; segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many patients with malignant tumors still have recurrence and metastasis after effective treatment. Exploring the mechanism of tumor recurrence and metastasis to predict the recurrence and metastasis of cancer is a major clinical issue. At the same time, the rapid development of the Human Genome Project and gene microarray technology has enabled the activity of many genes in the patient's body to be intuitively measured through the chip. The rapid development of machine learning has contributed to the data mining and medical science of this DNA microarray technology. Therefore, this project aims at the above-mentioned problems and predicts the location and time of recurrence by analyzing a large amount of clinical data and 2enetic data. Firstly, we perform simple data cleaning and normalization processing on clinical data and genetic data; second, perform differential gene screening; next, select principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, nuclear principal component analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling algorithms to reduce the dimensional of the data. Finally, the genetic data uses random forest, support vector machine, linear support vector machine, guided aggregation algorithm, gradient boosting algorithm, and ensemble learning for machine learning, and then finds the best parameters and methods through grid search, and selects the appropriate model Evaluation method. The clinical data is manually selected and classified using machine learning. Finally, the results of clinical data and genetic data are combined to predict the site of recurrence. Using the above method to predict the recurrence and the location of the recurrence, a good effect was achieved. Taking whether to recurrence as an example, the accuracy rate of the verification set reached 0.825, the recall rate reached 0.801, the Fl score reached 0.800.

In traditional approaches, the local GHI can be measured with very expensive instruments, and the large-area GHI collection depends on complex satellite-based models, solargis algorithms, and the high-performance computers (HPC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to capture the GHI conveniently and accurately. Considering the nonstationary property of the GHI on cloudy days, the GHI capturing is cast as an image regression problem. In traditional approaches, the image regression problem is treated as two parts, feature extraction (for the images) and regression model (for the regression targets), which are optimized separately and blocked the interconnections. Considering the nonlinear regression capability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image regression approach is proposed to provide an End-to-End solution for the cloudy day GHI capturing problem in this paper. The multilayer CNN is based on the AlexNet and VGG. The L2 (least square errors) with regularization is used as the loss function in the regression layer. For data cleaning, the Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference is employed to detect and eliminate the anomaly data in a nonparametric manner. The purified data are used as input data for the proposed image regression approach. In the experiments, three-month sky images and GHI data (with 1-min resolution) are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the HPC system. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.  2013 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:35","2022-07-31 15:00:51","","22235-22248","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2969549","Cleaning; Deep learning; Inference engines; Regression analysis; Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Bayesian networks; Gaussian distribution; Bayes methods; Solar radiation; deep learning; Computational modeling; Atmospheric modeling; Image processing; Bayesian theory; Clouds; Convolutional neural network; Dirichlet process; global horizontal irradiance; image regression; Radiation effects; sky image; solar irradiation; variational inference; ENERGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DNNs often require a large amount of data movement, resulting in performance and energy overheads. One promising way to address this problem is to design an accelerator based on in-situ analog computing that leverages the fundamental electrical properties of memristive circuits to perform matrix-vector multiplication. Recent work on analog neural network accelerators has shown great potential in improving both the system performance and the energy efficiency. However, detecting and correcting the errors that occur during in-memory analog computation remains largely unexplored. The same electrical properties that provide the performance and energy improvements make these systems especially susceptible to errors, which can severely hurt the accuracy of the neural network accelerators. This paper examines a new error correction scheme for analog neural network accelerators based on arithmetic codes. The proposed scheme encodes the data through multiplication by an integer, which preserves addition operations through the distributive property. Error detection and correction are performed through a modulus operation and a correction table lookup. This basic scheme is further improved by data-aware encoding to exploit the state dependence of the errors, and by knowledge of how critical each portion of the computation is to overall system accuracy. By leveraging the observation that a physical row that contains fewer 1s is less susceptible to an error, the proposed scheme increases the effective error correction capability with less than 4.5% area and less than 4.7% energy overheads. When applied to a memristive DNN accelerator performing inference on the MNIST and ILSVRC-2012 datasets, the proposed technique reduces the respective misclassification rates by 1.5x and 1.1x.  2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-06-10 02:10:35","2022-07-31 05:23:56","","52-65","","","2018-February","","","","Proceedings - International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2018.00015","Neural networks; Memory architecture; Deep neural networks; Error correction; Network architecture; Energy efficiency; Encoding (symbols); Acceleration; Analog computers; Computer architecture; Supercomputers; Table lookup; Accelerator architectures; Arrays; Computational modeling; Electric potential; Programming; Resistance; Thermal noise; CODES; NOISE; THERMAL AGITATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared with common interpolation algorithms and compressed sensing algorithms, this method obtains better repair results, is suitable for a wider range of applications, and does not need prior knowledge. This method adopts measures such as preparing training set data as well as the design and optimization of loss functions to achieve faster convergence speed, higher repair accuracy, and better stability. To fairly compare the repair performance of different signals, the mean squared error, relative peak-to-peak average error, and relative peak-to-peak max error are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the repair results of different signals.

In Thailand, many public agencies collect rainfall values, including National Hydro Informatics (HII), Thai Meteorological Department, etc., since the data are valuable in terms of rainfall prediction, which is important for an agricultural country like Thailand. The rainfall data is normally collected hourly, and because there are many sensor locations, it is hard to maintain these sensors. The sensor data can be lost transiently and/or may yield anomaly values. Since there is a lot of data flowing to the server every day, it is hard to inspect manually or even semi-manually. This project collaborates with HII to develop a system that automates the rainfall data quality improvement process. The machine learning algorithms are used as tools for data cleansing.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based QoE prediction approach with a large-scale QoE dataset for mobile video transmission. Specifically, we develop a mobile phone application for collecting user QoE data when viewing videos transmitted over the mobile internet in a practical environment. Then, we construct a large-scale dataset by collecting over 80000 piece of data with four kinds of subjective scores and 89 network parameters. Each QoE metric is related to only some of the 89 network parameters. Therefore, we apply the feature selection method to find the feature parameters related to user scores. Additionally, the boxplot method is used to clean the raw data by removing outliers. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to learn the relationships between the network parameters and the subjective QoE scores. The proposed DNN can also be seen as a data-driven objective QoE prediction approach for mobile video transmission, which can be used to predict the user QoE scores. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively remove most features irrelevant to QoE prediction. Moreover, the performance of QoE prediction by the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.  1983-2012 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:39","2022-07-31 05:41:25","","1337-1348","","6","37","","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904359","Monitoring; Deep learning; Neural networks; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Data acquisition; feature selection; User experience; Quality of service; data cleaning; deep learning; Databases; Streaming media; Quality assessment; Image communication systems; MODEL; data collection; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; Quality of experience; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; SERVICE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is able to determine stress, fatigue, workload, health status and pilot capacity with new models based on DCNN encoded in Python which are able to interpret these vital data.Additionally, PMS is able to launch alerts when the vital parameters of the crew reach pre-established limits, giving the chance to detect an abnormal situation (e.g. excessive workload scenario with high stress level). In this way, it will improve situational awareness by making crew aware of their own conditionGoing deeper into the details of the Stress Model, its main objective is to determine Pilot stress in real time.For achieving this target, several design stages were taken into consideration while building the Stress Model DCNN: raw data acquisition, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training, model evaluation, model testing, and result analysis. Further details of these stages are explained below.Regarding data acquisition, Stress Model obtains pilot's vital data from a smartwatch (one of the wearable devices of PMS), which communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a laptop. Selected device was Analog Devices Inc. Gen II watch, which sends the following signals: Heart Rate (HR), Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA), Skin temperature and 3D Acceleration.At Cleaning stage, Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) was used to normalize our raw data, being less sensitive to outliers and therefore more robust.At Feature engineering stage, several signal combinations were explored. The selected signal set which gave the best Stress Model accuracy was comprised of two EDA parameters (Real Admittance [Siemens], Impedance Magnitude [Ohm]) and wrist Skin Temperature [deg C].At Algorithm selection stage, three convolutional layers (128, 256 and 128 filters respectively) were chosen to extract a feature map from the inputs. After them, a Global Average Pooling (GAP) was chosen to compress the convolutions output. Downstream GAP, a decision layer based on softmax activation function (stress vs non-stress) was chosen.At Training stage, it was necessary to implement a Stress Test recording campaign. Participants were asked to fulfill several individual demanding tasks (memory, multi-task, stroop, vigilance) which included relaxing periods among them. The Stress Model was fed with the vital data obtained in this campaign.In between the tasks, NASA-TLX questionnaires were filled by test subjects, to obtain their subjective rating of Mental demand, Physical demand, Temporal demand, Performance, Effort and Frustration. Therefore, the Stress Model considered both vital data and self-report questionnaires as inputs.At result analysis stage, the Stress Model accuracy was refined, understanding accuracy as the ratio between correct predicted stress scenarios versus total cases, and considering ground truth self-report questionnaires.Finally, Stress Model DCNN was validated considering three data sources, whose details are included below:A.Vital data from fifteen (N=15) subjects of Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) Database available online.Stress Model gave an average test accuracy of 99%,B.Vital data from four (N=4) Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) pilots while calibrating their NASA-TLX scale.Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 90%.C.Vital data from six (N=6) ADS pilots while performing simulator evaluations using an Enhanced Light Weight Visor (ELWEV).Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 87%.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 14:15:41","","AESS; AIAA; AIAA Digital Avionics Technical Committee (DATC); et al.; IEEE; Southwest Research Institute (SWRI)","","","2021-October","","","","AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","San Antonio, TX, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594363","Monitoring; Deep neural networks; Data acquisition; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; NASA; Wearable computers; Analytical models; Training; Data models; Predictive models; Atmospheric modeling; Temperature sensors; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Electro-Dermal Activity; NASA-TLX; Pilot Stress; wearable devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prediction of electrical loads and scheduling the generation resources to match the demand enable the utility to mitigate the energy generation cost. Different methodologies have been employed to predict energy consumption at different levels of distribution and transmission systems. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict energy consumption in smart buildings. The proposed framework consists of two stages, namely, data cleaning, and model building. The data cleaning phase applies pre-processing techniques to the raw data and adds additional features of lag values. In the model-building phase, the hybrid model is trained on the processed data. The hybrid deep learning (DL) model is based on the stacking of fully connected layers, and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) on bi-directional LSTMs. The proposed model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies of energy consumption on dependent features and to be effective in terms of computational complexity, training time, and forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark energy consumption datasets yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy when compared with widely used hybrid models such as Convolutional (Conv) Neural Network-LSTM, ConvLSTM, LSTM encoder-decoder model, stacking models, etc. A mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.00% for case study 1 and a MAPE of 3.71% for case study 2 is obtained for the proposed forecasting DL model in comparison with LSTM-based models that yielded 7.80% MAPE and 5.099% MAPE for two datasets respectively. The proposed model has also been applied for multi-step week-ahead daily forecasting with an improvement of 8.368% and 20.99% in MAPE against the LSTM-based model for the utilized energy consumption datasets respectively.  2013 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 03:02:53","","33498-33511","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061370","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Learning systems; Forecasting; Benchmarking; Smart power grids; Energy utilization; Electric power transmission; Electric loads; Energy conservation; Intelligent buildings; Model buildings; deep learning; Data models; Predictive models; Energy consumption; Load modeling; Appliances energy forecasting; bidirectional LSTM; hybrid model; Long short term memory; power forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, various artificial intelligence (AI) based methods are utilized to perform optimal energy forecasting, different simulation tools, and engineering methods to predict future demand based on historical data. Nevertheless, nonlinear energy demand modeling is still unfledged for a better solution to handle short-term and long-term dependencies and avoid static nature because it is purely on historical data-driven. In this paper, we propose an ensemble deep learning-based approach to predict and forecast energy demand and consumption by using chronological dependencies. Our system initially processes the data, cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the model performance. Furthermore, the preprocess data is fed to proposed ensemble model to extract hybrid discriminative features by using convolution neural network (CNN), stacked, and bi-directional long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. We trained our proposed system on the historical data to forecast the energy demand and consumption with a different time interval. In the proposed technique, we utilized the concept of active learning based on moving windows to ensure and improve the prediction performance of the system. The proposed system could be applicable to employ energy consumption in industrial and building sectors to demonstrate their significance and effectiveness. We evaluated the proposed system by using benchmark, residential UCI, and local Korean commercial building datasets. We conducted different extensive experimentation to show the error rate and used various kinds of evaluation matrices, which indicate the lower error rate of the proposed system.  2013 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 04:21:34","","94262-94271","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093053","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Metadata; Buildings; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Energy management; LSTM; deep learning; Data models; Predictive models; Load modeling; SVM; convolution neural network; electricity demand forecast; Energy analysis; LSTM network; smart sensor system; CLASSIFICATION; CONSUMPTION; MODEL; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; LOAD; BUILDINGS; DEMAND; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This issue may seriously affect the data quality in some fields, such as transportation. A typical IoT application in transportation is electronic registration identification of the motor vehicle (ERI), an emerging traffic data acquisition technology based on RFID. ERI data play a vital role in intelligent transportation. However, the data quality is often affected seriously by the inaccurate timestamps, which arise from the time-unsynchronized distributed ERI readers. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, data repairing of time synchronization problems (DR-TSP), which can detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and correct timestamp-deviated ERI data. Precisely, DR-TSP consists of three components. Problem reader discovery component employs a statistics-based method to detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and discovers the clock leaps of the problematic ERI reader through a smoothing-based method. Travel-time estimation component constructs a spatial correlative travel-time estimation model based on the neural network to infer timestamp deviation. The influence of clock deviation is considered in the model training. Data correction component utilizes the above results to correct the timestamp-deviated data. Experiments over large-scale ERI data collected from a big China city, Chongqing, show that our method can significantly improve data quality.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 14:06:44","","11666-11677","","14","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3058640","Technology transfer; Internet of things; Advanced traffic management systems; Data acquisition; Clocks; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Synchronization; Travel time; Internet of Things; Data models; Roads; Sensors; Data cleaning and repairing; radio-frequency identification (RFID); Radiofrequency identification; time synchronization problem; travel-time estimation model; OUTLIER DETECTION; THINGS; INTERNET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, the accuracy of these tools relies on the generation of large training sets of pre-labeled images. This is typically a challenging and cumbersome process, requiring extensive pre-processing to remove spurious samples that may lead the training to failure. Unlike their plain counterparts, which tend to provide overconfident decisions and cannot identify samples they have not been specifically trained for, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks provide a reliable measure of classification uncertainty.

First, sufficient high-quality training data is inevitable for producing a well-performed model, but the data is always human expensive to acquire.Second, a large amount of training data and complicated model structures lead to the inefficiency of training and inference. Third, given an ML task, one always needs to train lots of models, which are hard to manage in real applications. Fortunately, database techniques can benefit ML by addressing the above three challenges.

(2) Model training \ inference(In-ML): researchers in ML community focus on improving the model performance during training, while in this survey we mainly study how to accelerate the entire training process, also including feature selection and model selection.

Preparing data set to be used in machine learning is an important task to map between raw data input (cause) and output (result) relation. Google traces are dump tables that contain raw data about data center servers, workload jobs and tasks status, workload demands, data center provisioned resources and hardware reconfiguration. Machine learning considers input data set and output data set as a training learning model by relating these two correlated sets as normalized values for future use. In this work, a data cleaning and full analysis for Google data center traces have been done to be used in deep machine learning models, like conventional neural network or recurrent neural network with capability of using inline learning model. Data set are processed by re-normalizing resources capacities and workloads demands (jobs and tasks), and by removing or transforming non-Available and opaque values into useful values. A novel correlation between input and output data sets for Google traces is introduced that relates workload demands with data center resources reconfiguration, and data center resources with data center capacity. The idea is to connect between demands and provisioned resources by evaluating the cloud data center configuration sets, which allows cloud manager to provision resources by setting up the best reconfiguration in scaling cloud data center. An evaluation factor (scale factor) has been introduced to evaluate elastic provisioning resources considering resources preparation time and minimum cost.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:43","2022-07-31 13:37:25","","","","","","","","","2019 International Conference on Smart Applications, Communications and Networking, SmartNets 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SmartNets48225.2019.9069765","Machine learning; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Cloud computing; Metadata; Personnel training; Reconfigurable hardware; Data models; Task analysis; Data centers; Data Cleaning; Google; Google Traces; Logs Analysis; Logs Correlation; Random access memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning provides one approach that can offer new opportunities for prediction of air pollution. There are however many different machine learning approaches and identifying the best one for the problem at hand is often challenging. In this paper air pollution data, specifically particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) was collected from a variety of web-based resources and following, data cleansing analysed with different machine learning models including linear regression, Artificial Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural networks.

However, most of existing AutoML pipelines only touch parts of the full machine learning pipeline, e.g., neural architecture search or optimizer selection. This leaves potentially important components such as data cleaning and model ensemble out of the optimization, and still results in considerable human involvement and suboptimal performance. The main challenges lie in the huge search space assembling all possibilities over all components, as well as the generalization ability over different tasks like image, text, and tabular etc. In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind fully AutoML pipeline, to comprehensively automate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model generation/selection/training and ensemble for an arbitrary dataset and evaluation metric. Our innovation lies in the comprehensive scope of a learning pipeline, with a novel 'life-long' knowledge anchor design to fundamentally accelerate the search over the full search space. Such knowledge anchors record detailed information of pipelines and integrates them with an evolutionary algorithm for joint optimization across components. Experiments demonstrate that the result pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and modalities.

Distinguished from the existing literatures of Polar codes that only consider the error detection capability of CRC, we attempt to take advantage of the inherent error correction capability of CRC and we first devise a segmented CRC-error-correcting aided SCL decoding (SCC-SCL) framework. Based on this framework, an error-correcting table based SCC-SCL (ET-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme is proposed, by introducing the look-up-table based CRC error correction method into the segmented Polar SCL decoding process. Since the error correction capability is limited by the size of the look-up table, which in turn limits the performance gain, we further propose a deep learning based SCC-SCL (DL-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme. In this scheme, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network replaces the error correction table to perform error correction, combining the sequence of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) with the syndromes to determine the error patterns. Simulation results show that both of the proposed decoding schemes have significant performance gain over the classic CRC error-detection aided SCL decoding scheme. Especially for the DL-SCC-SCL, the performance gain at bit error rate of 10-5 is about 0.5 dB.  2015 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:46","2022-07-31 13:49:29","","817-828","","2","6","","IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2946358","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Bit error rate; Error detection; Error correction; Decoding; Table lookup; error correction; Redundancy; Turbo codes; deep learning; Error correction codes; CRC; Cyclic redundancy check codes; Performance gain; Polar codes; successive cancellation list decoding; CODES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to qualitatively assess the possibilities for using machine learning in the process of detecting data incompleteness and inaccuracy, since these two data quality dimensions were found to be the most significant by a previous research study conducted by the authors. A review of existing literature concludes that there is no unique machine learning algorithm most suitable to deal with both incompleteness and inaccuracy of data. Various algorithms are selected from existing studies and applied against a representative big (healthcare) dataset. Following experiments, it was also discovered that the implementation of machine learning algorithms in this context encounters several challenges for Big Data quality activities. These challenges are related to the amount of data particualar machine learning algorithms can scale to and also to certain data type restrictions imposed by some machine learning algorithms.

Web pages that a search engine has scoured are first parsed to remove HTML elements and java scripts. After this phase, remove common keywords or stop words from the crawled pages. The affixes (prefix and suffix) from crawled pages are drawn by extracting keywords from the text. Finally, the collected keywords generate the similarity score between two papers. This research has proved that the suggested algorithms outperform earlier ones by conducting an extensive experimental investigation on several actual datasets. New algorithms outperform those already in use, according to the test findings. Since there are so many documents on the internet, web search engines have had difficulty finding relevant results for their customers. Overhead costs for search engines have risen dramatically due to an overabundance of almost similar or identical documents somehow. The web crawling community has long been aware of duplicate and near-identical online pages. Users want search engines to return relevant results for their searches on the first page, free of duplicates and redundancies. This is an important criterion. An essential enabler in the health industry is record or data linking, as connected data is an economic resource that may aid enhance research into health policy, detecting bad medication responses, and cutting expenses while uncovering health system fraud. Recent years have seen significant progress in several record linking approaches, mostly due to breakthroughs in data mining and machine learning. Most of these novel technologies have not yet been incorporated in current record linking systems or are disguised in commercial software as 'black boxes.' When it comes to learning about new record linking strategies and comparing old methods with new ones, this makes it difficult for users to do so.

Common ad-hoc and case-specific imputation are not enough to ensure high quality and effective imputation. We adopt the similar verification logic of supervised learning. We use artificial missing sampling as the test set to estimate a set of imputers' performances and use the estimated performances to select the best imputer. To ensure the correctness of selection, we analyze the impact of various factors on estimation accuracy. Those factors are missing rate, size of artificial missing data and patterns, selected imputers, and noise level. We propose a two-step verifiable imputation process to integrate all of the steps. With this process, we can always leverage the most suitable imputer to achieve a high quality of imputation without tedious and error-prone data cleaning efforts. We implement the tool as a Python package, with many imputers with their unique capabilities and a API. We automate the imputation through a standard process, which returns imputed results and detailed rationales of selection along with quality metrics.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:06","2022-07-31 15:44:47","","1764-1773","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Atlanta, GA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377909","Big data; Automation; Supervised learning; Time series; Time series analysis; time series; Big Data; Estimation; Tools; imputation; Standards; artificial miss sampling; auto-imputing; consecutive missing; missing pattern; performance; two-step imputation process; verification; NOISE; VALUES; MISSING-VALUE IMPUTATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the total sleep time is essential to assess the sleep apnea severity, a sleep-wake classifier was developed based on heart rate and respiration. These two signals were selected as they can be measured using unobtrusive sensors. A 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to classify 30s epochs of tachograms and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals. The input based on beat-to-beat variability allows the use of different sensor types. A dataset of 56 patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) below 10 was used to train and validate the network. This CNN was applied to an independent test set of ECG and RIP signals of 25 subjects. Of these, 8 subjects were simultaneously monitored using an unobtrusive capacitive-coupled ECG (ccECG) sensor integrated in a mattress. Artefact removal and data correction was performed on this acquired data. The performance on the independent dataset of ECG and RIP is comparable to state-of-the-art, with ? = 0.48. However, application on the ccECG data resulted in a drop in performance, with ? = 0.30. This was caused by a low amount of remaining wake epochs after data cleaning. Importantly, the network classified 30s segments of sleep apnea patients, without relying on past or future information for feature extraction.  2020 Creative Commons; the authors hold their copyright.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:08","2022-07-31 04:18:58","","","","","2020-September","","","","Computing in Cardiology","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Rimini, Italy","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.22489/CinC.2020.147","Monitoring; Feature extraction; Cardiology; Convolutional neural networks; Biomedical signal processing; Wearable sensors; Electrocardiography; Capacitive sensors; Plethysmography; Sleep research; Wakes; Biomedical monitoring; Sleep apnea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ETA predictions are unreliable due to the lack of good quality historical data, while 'live' positions in mobile apps suffer from delays in data transmission. This study uses deep neural networks to predict the next position of a bus under various vehicle-location data-quality regimes. Additionally, we assess the effect of the target representation in the prediction problem by encoding it either as unconstrained geographical coordinates, progress along known trajectory or ETA at the next two stops. We demonstrate that without data cleaning, model predictions give false confidence if mean errors are used, highlighting the importance of a holistic assessment of the results. We show that target representation affects the prediction accuracy, by constraining the prediction space. The literature is vague about quality issues in public transport data. Here we show that noisy data is a problem and discuss simple but effective approaches to address these issues. Research generally only focuses on a single method of target representation. Therefore, comparing several methods is a useful addition to the literature. This gives insight into the value of addressing data quality issues in urban transport data to enable better predictions and improve the passenger experience. We show that 'rephrasing' the prediction problem by changing the target representation can yield massively improved predictions.

While most data-driven models are trained on simulation data as it is relatively easier to collect a large amount of data from physics-based simulations, there are many challenges in applying data-driven methods on experiments: 1) experimental data is usually not clean; and 2) it generally has a greater degree of heterogeneity. In this project, we have developed a data-driven methodology to address these challenges on an industrial magnet dataset, where the goal is to predict magnetic properties (forward models) at different stages of the experimental workflow. The data-driven methodology consists of data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model development using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to accurately predict magnet properties. In particular, we have developed three different types of predictive models: 1) numerical model using only numerical data containing composition and processing information; 2) image model using image data representing structure information; and 3) combination model using both types of data together. In addition to predictive models, the analysis and comparison of results across the models provide several interesting data-driven insights. Such data-driven analytics has the potential to help guide future experiments and realize the inverse models, which could significantly reduce costs and accelerate the discovery of new magnets with superior properties.

It brings the opportunity to use universal big data for further computation that may deliver new insights and automation system. The technology that enables this work is artificial intelligence (AI). As known, the utilization of AI technology is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily life. Furthermore, discussion related to AI has played an essential role in an organization's decision-making process. Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-to-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth. The end-to-end process begins with data collection covering various types of data (text, picture, audio, video, animation) and various methods (survey, observation, interview, experiment). Then, it continues with the pre-process data cleansing and process to determine data features, and seeks the relationship within them, using machine learning process with appropriate algorithms. The results may then be used for applications portfolio in order to improve organization strategies and programs. The organization's performance can be visualized from time to time for continuous quality improvement. The end-to-end cycles of processes continue, from data collection, data pre-processing and processing, performance computation monitoring (identification, classification, prediction, and prescription), improving strategy and program, and implementing in the real-life activities until generating more behavioral data, finding pattern and design the systems. As a whole, this end-to-end cycle leads us to an AI automation system, with the power to generate meaningful insights suited to solve current problems, predicting trending issues, and understanding phenomena.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:11","2022-07-31 03:52:44","","9-18","","","","","","","2020 5th International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security (IWBIS)","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWBIS50925.2020.9255497","Big data; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Automation; neural nets; Artificial intelligence; data analysis; learning (artificial intelligence); Feature extraction; Decision making; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Security of data; Application programs; decision making; Big Data; machine learning; deep learning; big data; Correlation; Classification algorithms; artificial intelligence; AI; automation system; end-to-end cycle processes; finding pattern; ICT; Enterprise resource planning; PERFORMANCE; LOG DATA; NEWS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a typical data-analysis pipeline, data cleaning is the most cost-intensive, laborious, and time-consuming step. Unclean dataset or partially cleaned dataset can lead to incorrect training of machine learning models and result in wrong conclusions. Generally, data-scientists examine null, missing, or duplicate values, and the dataset is cleaned by removing the entire record or imputing the values. However, deleting the records, or imputing the values cannot be termed as comprehensive cleaning, as these cleaning techniques may result in a reduction in the population of data, and increased error in estimation due to biased values. For systematically cleaning an unclean dataset, it is necessary to comply with the data quality dimensions such as completeness, validity, consistency, accuracy, and conformity. The errors described as violations of expectations for completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency and other dimensions of data quality often impede the successful completion of information processing streams and consequently degrade the dependent business processes. Therefore, educating a data-scientist for comprehensively cleaning a raw-dataset acquired for analysis is an incremental learning process. Moreover, for extensive training on cleaning a dataset on different quality dimensions, it is necessary to provide a variety of datasets that are unclean on various data quality dimensions. Hence, in this paper, we present DWreck, a data wrecker framework for generating unclean datasets by counterproductively applying different data quality dimensions. The DWreck framework is designed on the principles of microservices architecture pattern. For allowing function-specific extensibility, the DWreck comprises four groups of microservices: (a) Dataset Profiling, (b) Data type Processing, (c) Counterproductive Dimensions, and (d) Miscellaneous. The orchestrator coordinates the different microservices in a complex workflow that is further split into three sub-workflows to generate an unclean (wrecked) dataset as an output.

Although data reliability can be achieved by data recovery with conventional replication, the communication between IoT is susceptible to eavesdropping. Therefore, in this paper, we study the eavesdropping prevention of data repair in IoT environments based on network coding. We theoretically derive the relation between security level and storage in heterogeneous IoT systems. To further reduce the repair bandwidth, we exploit recurrent neural network for the storage failure prediction. Under the condition when failure probability and workloads of storage devices are considered, two allocation algorithms are proposed to avoid data repair. Finally, we show the relation between storage cost and reliability with different numbers of IoT devices.

Low Birth Weight (LBW) has become an increasingly common problem, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Therefore, an ability to predict the LBW is beneficial and a good preventive measure. It is also a good indicator of future health risks of that infant. This study is concerned about the implementation of predictive LBW models for rural and urban areas of Afghanistan based on the data obtained from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015. The main objective of the study is to identify the most suitable machine learning techniques (i.e. classifiers) among the five popular ones. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Prior to implementing the predictive models, data preprocessing is carried out. This is done by means of data cleansing and feature selection. The well-known Correlation based Feature Selection algorithm (CFS) is employed to select the top ten attributes. The classifier in this study comprises two categories, Normal and LBW. The preparation of the dataset is carefully done to ensure well-balanced samples in each category. The study reveals that Random Forest is the best classifier with an accuracy of 84.70% and 85.2% and with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 91.0% and 92.1% for both rural and urban areas, respectively.

Considering the lack of abnormal annotations in the electricity load data, this paper proposes a semi-supervised electricity load data anomaly detection method based on MixMatch. Firstly, data cleaning of electricity load data is used to remove incorrect data. Secondly, Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is used to extract its time-domain and frequency-domain features separately, and the features are combined through feature fusion. Thirdly, the Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline-SMOTE) is used to solve the problem of data imbalance. The MixMatch semi-supervised algorithm is used to label the abnormal data to realize the anomaly detection of the electricity load data. Finally, this paper uses the k-means clustering and T-Stochastic neighbour Embedding (T -SNE) to classify the abnormal data and visualize the data.

Existing data preparation and integration systems are known to make mistakes that need to be corrected by humans, which is labor-intensive and expensive especially at scale [19], [20], [25], [9], [8]. The accuracy is also known to suffer on dirty data. In this paper we define and evaluate tabular embeddings to help increase the accuracy.Embeddings, is a well-known dimensionality reduction technique, usually applied to represent (one-dimensional) text documents/sentences as vectors for further analytics [28], [7], [23]. Using embeddings lowers dimensionality, as well as the models trained with embeddings often exhibit higher accuracy, compared to the same trained without such, because the embeddings vectors store the context information. Our 2-dimensional embeddings are more suitable for tables rather than text. We justify their efficiency on fundamental tasks on tables such as classifying columns and tuples.We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and compare the Neural Network trained with tabular embeddings against the same trained without such embeddings. We report significant accuracy gains in tuple classification when using the Neural Network trained with our tabular embeddings - up to 17.6% delta in F-measure for Songs compared with the same without our embeddings.

Moreover, a data also consists of structured and unstructured data that must be prepared before a computation with text mining or machine learning. Therefore, the text preprocessing becomes one of the most very important tasks because it includes many steps.

CC allows to migrate the computing power to the internet services. That makes cloud system target of attackers to disrupt services or data breaching. Many existing works try to deal with security issues in cloud computing systems, but it is still suffering against new updated attacks. Therefore, it’s necessary to develop new IDS able to detect attacks with high performance. In this paper, we present a distributed IDS based on big data tools and machine learing algorithms to detect attacks in the cloud systems. This proposed system designed to be installed in the front of cloud network architecture. The network traffic is collected from edge routers and streamed with Kafka component to Spark component for prepressing, anomaly detection and attack classification. In preprocessing stage, data cleaning, formatting and feature selection based on K-means clustering are performed. In the anomaly detection and attack classification, we compared different machine learning algorithms optimized with hypermeters tuning based on grid search.

Gabrys","Automatic Composition and Optimization of Multicomponent Predictive Systems With an Extended Auto-WEKA","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","","1558-3783","10.1109/TASE.2018.2876430","","Composition and parameterization of multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) consisting of chains of data transformation steps are a challenging task. Auto-WEKA is a tool to automate the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) optimization problem. In this paper, we extend the CASH problem and Auto-WEKA to support the MCPS, including preprocessing steps for both classification and regression tasks. We define the optimization problem in which the search space consists of suitably parameterized Petri nets forming the sought MCPS solutions. In the experimental analysis, we focus on examining the impact of considerably extending the search space (from approximately 22000 to 812 billion possible combinations of methods and categorical hyperparameters). In a range of extensive experiments, three different optimization strategies are used to automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available data sets. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial for different predictive models. We also present the results on seven data sets from real chemical production processes. Our findings can have a major impact on the development of high-quality predictive models as well as their maintenance and scalability aspects needed in modern applications and deployment scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The extension of Auto-WEKA to compose and optimize multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) developed as part of this paper is freely available on GitHub under GPL license, and we encourage practitioners to use it on a broad variety of classification and regression problems. The software can either be used as a blackbox-where search space is made of all possible WEKA filters, predictors, and metapredictors (e.g., ensembles)-or as an optimization tool on a subset of preselected machine learning methods. The application has a graphical user interface, but it can also run from command line and can be embedded in any project as a Java library. There are three main outputs once an Auto-WEKA run has finished: 1) the trained MCPS ready to make predictions on unseen data; 2) the WEKA configuration (i.e., parameterized components); and 3) the Petri net in a Petri Net Markup Language format that can be analyzed using any tool supporting this standard language. There are, however, some practical considerations affecting the quality of the results that must be taken into consideration, such as the CPU time budget or the search starting point. These are extensively discussed in this paper.","2019-04","2022-06-10 02:26:43","2022-07-31 15:45:26","","946-959","","2","16","","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Optimization; Petri nets; Computational modeling; Data models; Predictive models; Task analysis; Tools; Bayesian optimization; Automatic predictive model building and parameterization; combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) problem; data preprocessing; multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs); predictive modeling; SEARCH; SOFT SENSORS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the existence of non-palpable nodules it is very hard to detect the structural changes of thyroid disease by assessing the thyroid functional changes. For instance at structural level “Euthyroid” is normal thyroid hormonal functional state but this would be involved in initial structural changes such as goiter, cold nodule, MNG (multiple nodule goiter) and cancer (Grave's Disease and so on). The ideal system should not only identify all the thyroid disease types but also recommend state of structural levels; otherwise it would be converted into serious disease, such like cancer. In-order to mitigate such problems, this paper proposes a framework TDTD (Thyroid Disease Types Diagnostics) that aims to assist the physicians during the diagnostic process of thyroid diseases in a very structured and transparent manner. Proposed system TDTD presents a novel method MDC (Medical data cleaning) for filling of missing values in medical datasets by building classifier based upon the Bayesian isotonic regression algorithm because missing values of medical data (i.e. blood tests) are different in nature and they could not be filled with normal procedures. In second phase two classifiers are trained to classify the functional and structural levels of thyroid disease at granular level using multi and binary SVM (support vector machine) algorithms, in final phase performance and evaluation is approximated using confusion matrix, precision and recall measures.","2016-01-15","2022-06-10 02:26:43","2022-07-31 04:06:18","","44-50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Engineering (ICISE)","","","","Support vector machines; Diseases; Blood; machine learning; Classification algorithms; Medical diagnostic imaging; Biochemistry; missing values; Datamining; Glands; goiters; thyroid hormone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Intelligent Systems Engineering (ICISE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These counters can easily generate a huge amount (e.g., GB or TB per day) of data, which we call big performance data in cloud computing platforms with more than thousands of servers and millions of complex workloads running in a ""24/7/365"" manner. The big performance data provides a precious foundation for root cause analysis of performance bottlenecks, architecture and compiler optimization, and many more. However, it is challenging to extract value from the big performance data due to: 1) the many unperceivable errors (e.g., outliers and missing values); and 2) the difficulty of obtaining insights, e.g., relating events to performance. In this paper, we propose CounterMiner, a rigorous methodology that enables the measurement and understanding of big performance data by using data mining and machine learning techniques. It includes three novel components: 1) using data cleaning to improve data quality by replacing outliers and filling in missing values; 2) iteratively quantifying, ranking, and pruning events based on their importance with respect to performance; 3) quantifying interaction intensity between two events by residual variance. We use sixteen benchmarks (eight from CloudSuite and eight from the Spark version of HiBench) to evaluate CounterMiner. The experimental results show that CounterMiner reduces the average error from 28.3% to 7.7% when multiplexing 10 events on 4 hardware counters. We also conduct a real-world case study, showing that identifying important configuration parameters of Spark programs by event importance is much faster than directly ranking the importance of these parameters.","2018-10-20","2022-06-10 02:26:43","2022-07-31 14:34:03","","613-626","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 51st Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)","","","","Cloud computing; Data mining; Time series analysis; data mining; Program processors; big data; Benchmark testing; Hardware; computer architecture; Microarchitecture; Performance; performance counters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 51st Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the openness of the mariculture environment makes the variation of water quality nonlinear, dynamic and complex. Traditional methods face challenges in prediction accuracy and generalization performance. To address these problems, an accurate water quality prediction scheme is proposed for pH, water temperature and dissolved oxygen. First, we construct a new huge raw data set collected in time series consisting of 23,204 groups of data. Then, the water quality parameters are preprocessed for data cleaning successively through threshold processing, mean proximity method, wavelet filter, and improved smoothing method. Next, the correlation between the water quality to be predicted and other dynamics parameters is revealed by the Pearson correlation coefficient method. Meanwhile, the data for training is weighted by the discovered correlation coefficients. Finally, by adding a backward SRU node to the training sequence, which can be integrated into the future context information, the deep Bi-S-SRU (Bi-directional Stacked Simple Recurrent Unit) learning network is proposed. After training, the prediction model can be obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed prediction method achieve higher prediction accuracy than the method based on RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with similar or less time computing complexity. In our experiments, the proposed method takes 12.5ms to predict data on average, and the prediction accuracy can reach 94.42&amp;#x0025; in the next 3&amp;#x007E;8 days.","2020","2022-06-10 02:26:59","2022-07-31 01:54:32","","24784-24798","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971253","Long short-term memory; Cleaning; Deep learning; Learning systems; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Agriculture; Time series analysis; Water quality; Interpolation; Complex networks; Correlation methods; Precision agriculture; deep learning; Data models; Predictive models; Correlation; Smoothing methods; precision agriculture; Smart mariculture; SRU; water quality prediction; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved oxygen; Marine biology; Sulfur determination; MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN CONTENT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Algorithmic Aspects of Parallel Data Processing discusses recent algorithmic developments for distributed data processing. It uses a theoretical model of parallel processing called the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which is a simplification of the BSP model where the only cost is given by the amount of communication and the number of communication rounds.

In this paper we clean StackOverflow, one of the most popular online discussion forums for programmers, to generate a parallel English-Code corpus from Android posts. We contrast three data cleaning approaches: standard NLP, title only, and software task extraction. We evaluate the quality of the each corpus for MT. To provide indicators of how useful each corpus will be for machine translation, we provide researchers with measurements of the corpus size, percentage of unique tokens, and per-word maximum likelihood alignment entropy. We have used these corpus cleaning approaches to translate between English and Code [22, 23], to compare existing SMT approaches from word mapping to neural networks [24], and to re-examine the ""natural software"" hypothesis [29]. After cleaning and aligning the data, we create a simple maximum likelihood MT model to show that English words in the corpus map to a small number of specific code elements. This model provides a basis for the success of using StackOverflow for search and other tasks in the software engineering literature and paves the way for MT.

For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. In this initial study we focus mainly on brain MRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing state-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging patients (BA \not ≈ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that the remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients.

Owning to their large size, only slide-level labels or a handful of coarse annotations are usually provided for pathology images, which makes the training of the classifier challenging. In this study, we propose a conceptually simple, two-stage approach to classify small and large duct types in intrahepatic chalongio-carcinoma using only slide-level labels. Unlike conventional pathology image analysis methods employ multiple instance learning (MIL) applied to overcome the problem of the slide-level label, we introduce a novel label smoothing method to progressively refine the training labels to improve the classification accuracy. The main idea is that we introduce the hidden class, which is assumed to be mutually inclusive of all ground-truth classes and less confident for classification. By iteratively refining (i.e., smoothing) per-patch labels, we can extract and discard the hidden class from the training data. We demonstrate that the proposed label filtering scheme improves the classification accuracy by up to 30% compared to the baseline MIL method and 10% compared to the state-of-the-art noisy label cleaning method. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gene mutation prior information in the classification of two different duct types. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method may provide pathologists insight into the study of correlations between genetic and histologic subtypes.","2021-04-13","2022-06-10 02:27:02","2022-07-31 03:18:28","","1944-1948","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434095","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Pathology; Training; Training data; Smoothing methods; Biological system modeling; Image enhancement; Refining; Ducts; duct type; hidden class detection; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; multiple instance learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Sampling technology has been widely used in big data context. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Hence this article focuses on researching sampling for data profiling tasks in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.","2020","2022-06-10 02:27:03","2022-07-31 04:28:42","","72713-72726","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988120","Anomaly detection; Big data; Data handling; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Digital storage; Data mining; Metadata; Big Data; Task analysis; Systematics; data profiling; large amount; Relational databases; sampling; Sampling methods; Importance sampling; DISCOVERY; DEPENDENCIES; DISTANCE THRESHOLDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly, transport planning and operations in large events are well known to be a challenge. Not only they imply stress to the system on an irregular basis, their associated mobility behavior is also difficult to predict. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between number of public transport arrivals with the semi-structured data mined from online announcement websites. However, these models tend to be complex in form and demand substantial information retrieval, extraction and data cleaning work, and so they are difficult to generalize from city to city. In contrast, this paper focuses on enriching previously mined information about special events using automated web search queries. Since this context data comes in unstructured natural language form, we employ supervised topic model to correlate it with real measurements of transport usage. In this way, the proposed approach is more generic and a transit agency can start planning ahead as early as the event is announced on the web. The results show that using information mined from the web search not only shows high prediction accuracy of public transport demand, but also potentially provides interesting insights about popular event categories based on extracted topics.","2016-11-01","2022-06-10 02:27:03","2022-07-31 03:41:52","","1342-1347","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","","","Internet; Planning; Data models; Predictive models; Urban areas; Web search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If we can build a model based on historical data features to predict the deployment of equipment and personnel in key areas, we can preempt and gain an advantage on the battlefield. A frequency-driven temporal convolution network TFCN (Frequency-Temporal Convolution Network) is introduced based on the theoretical framework of deep learning and combining the time and frequency domain features of data in the traditional digital signal processing field. Inspired by Shannon&amp;#x2019;s sampling theorem, to achieve the purpose of fast learning of time series data features, it is necessary to satisfy the sampling frequency greater than twice the frequency of the principal components of time series data, ie., to ensure that the network structure and parameters sample the features-within at least one-half of the main period of the data, and then optimize the division of the data set and the design of the network structure. In this paper, -we standardize the time series data after data cleaning, and demonstrate that the above process does not affect the frequency distribution of the original data. We build the model to achieve prediction and evaluation, and the experiment result indicates that the TFCN we proposed can learn the characteristics of time series data faster than DNN, LSTM and other models, its loss curve can converge faster, and the prediction results are more accurate.","2021-10-22","2022-06-10 02:27:03","2022-07-31 03:57:54","","4571-4577","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAC53003.2021.9728354","Deep learning; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Data mining; Convolution; Time series; Time series analysis; Time domain analysis; Frequency domain analysis; Predictive models; Prediction algorithms; Data Mining; Signal processing algorithms; Frequency-Temporal Convolutional Network; Intelligence Collection; Time-frequency analysis; Curve fitting; Digital signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clarity of vehicular data for efficient decision making is vital in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Huge volumes of vehicular data are collected and processed during vehicular transactions. Pre-processing the huge amounts of raw vehicular data followed by framing effective traffic rules to take appropriate rapid decisions by the ITS on the vehicles continues to be a challenging problem. Most of the current studies done on ITS have proposed decision making strategies to handle only specific vehicular events and many lacked framing intelligent dynamic decision rules along with appropriate actions, representing all traffic events prevailing in the vehicular environment. This study proposes a versatile decision engine implanted with a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, we propose a novel data cleaning algorithm to identify and remove dirty data from the voluminous vehicular dataset. In the second stage, a unique rule framing mechanism is suggested to frame dynamic traffic rules along with their actions using real-time vehicular data. The vehicular entities take suitable decisions to respond to the traffic events based on these rules and their associated actions. A new Naïve Bayesian classifier is proposed in this study to test the new rule framed with the trained rules set, either to accept or reject the new rule for further processing. The algorithms are developed and implemented using machine learning concepts. Experimental and comparative analysis was carried out with other related referred studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Although the proposed decision engine is generic enough for decision making in most ITS use-cases, discussion in this article elaborates on its applicability in use-cases provisioning trust management.","2020","2022-06-10 02:27:04","2022-07-31 14:05:29","","72757-72767","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987414","Cleaning; Machine learning; Decision making; Statistical tests; Intelligent systems; Behavioral research; Engines; Dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Task analysis; data pre-processing; artificial intelligence; rule framing; trust management; Vehicle dynamics; Vehicular networks; Acceptance tests; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; ALGORITHM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the limitation of using numeric data only in the clustering process, F Jiang proposed the initialization method for K-modes clustering in which the initial cluster centres were calculated using Ini_Distance and Ini_Entropy methods were used. To improve the performance further, a new modified model is proposed for Fuzzy K-modes clustering. In this model, a modified Initial_Distance and Initial_Entropy Initialization method are used. It ensures that K initial cluster centers are not selected from the same cluster and selected initial cluster centers are not outliers. Also, one of a data preprocessing methods-Data cleaning is used to increase the quality of clustering results and a new modified weight matching distance (WMD) is calculated by using distance between two objects at the time initialization.

Widespread application of PMU produces a vast amount of time-synchronized historical operating data, making it possible to turn to machine learning approaches to detect the attacks. However, anomalous events occur rarely in practice. To construct a balanced training dataset, where normal and anomalous instances need to be evenly extracted and labeled from historical operating records, is sure to cost plenty of human efforts and may introduce uncontrollable experience errors.

This paper presents two approaches for the detection and imputation of anomalies in time series data. Autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are used to extract the characteristics of time series. Anomalies are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals, and the anomalous data points are imputed using the ARX and ANN models. Because the anomalies affect the model coefficients, the data cleaning process is performed iteratively. The models are re-learned on “cleaner” data after an anomaly is imputed. The anomalous data are reimputed to each iteration using the updated ARX and ANN models. The ARX and ANN data cleaning models are evaluated on natural gas time series data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed approaches are able to identify and impute anomalous data points. Forecasting models learned on the unclean data and the cleaned data are tested on an uncleaned out-of-sample dataset. The forecasting model learned on the cleaned data outperforms the model learned on the unclean data with 1.67% improvement in the mean absolute percentage errors and a 32.8% improvement in the root mean squared error.

Insufficient hormone production causes hypothyroidism. Tiredness, dry skin, cold intolerance, facial swelling, menstrual cycles, and hair loss are all symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. It is far more vital to prevent rather than cure such disorders, because most therapies involve long-term medication. As a result, it&amp;#x0027;s critical to look at the thyroid dataset for early disease detection so that steps can be done to avoid the deadly condition of thyroid disease. Machine learning techniques are important in the medical profession because they help doctors make better decisions, diagnose diseases more accurately, and save patients money and time. To make the data rudimentary enough for analytics to highlight the likelihood of patients developing thyroid disease, data cleaning techniques were used. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy and other performance criteria of multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting thyroid disease. This paper focuses on the current machine learning techniques utilized in the diagnosis and prediction of thyroid detection.","2022-03-25","2022-06-10 02:27:22","2022-07-30 22:18:49","","1189-1192","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2022 8th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICACCS54159.2022.9785052","Cleaning; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Forecasting; Diagnosis; Hormones; Data cleaning; Predictive models; Machine learning algorithms; Production; Prediction; Biochemistry; Data set; Skin; Thyroid disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 8th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, a number of studies have shown that convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used to classify aurora images with high accuracy. We analyzed aurora images and found that there is a certain amount of mislabeled data in aurora datasets. As this labeling error causes the difficulty in judging the shape of aurora, it is important for aurora image classification to assign accurate labels to aurora images. However, the shape of aurora is ambiguous and it is very difficult to label the aurora image accurately. We think that these mislabeled data are hindering aurora image analysis. In this study, we propose a classification method and a CNN training method that reduces the effect of mislabeled data. Specifically, we used Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) for aurora image classification instead of a final layer of a pre-trained CNN model. In addition, we propose a simple method for determining mislabeled data. Using a combination of these two methods to automatically classify aurora images, we achieved an F1 score of 0.945 for an aurora image dataset with four labels: arc aurora, drapery, hot-spot and radial, an improvement of 0.2 over traditional CNN-based classification.","2021","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 15:39:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000767230602032","","","","","","","Cleaning; Training; Prediction algorithms; Training data; image classification; Convolutional neural network; label cleaning; k-nearest neighbor; Ion radiation effects; Nearest neighbor methods; Shape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IECON 2021 - 47TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After analyzing the correlation of each reference quantity, pre-process and normalize the selected light intensity data and neighboring power station data respectively. For missing data, use nnz function to identify. For singular data, a curve similarity function is constructed, and the function values are clustered to be identified by contour coefficients. The sample data point set of [0.5,1] is used as the training set. [-1, -0.5] is the singular point abnormal photovoltaic output curve, plus missing samples, the two constitute the sample data set to be repaired.

We introduce GEDet, a few-shot learning based framework to detect erroneous nodes in graphs. GEDet consists of two novel components, each addresses a unique challenge. (1) To cope with the lack of examples, we introduce a graph augmentation module to enrich training labels. The module not only generates additional synthetic training labels by simulating different erroneous scenarios, but also exploits non-local relations to enrich neighborhood information. (2) To further improve the accuracy, we introduce an adversarially learned module that can better detect erroneous nodes by distinguishing nodes with synthetic and real labels encoded by graph autoencoders. Unlike conventional error detection models, GEDet yields effective classifiers that are optimized for a few yet diversified examples in the presence of multiple error scenarios. We show that using only a small number of examples, GEDet significantly improves the competing methods such as constraint based detection and anomaly detection, with a gain of 35% on recall, and 30% on precision.","2020","2022-06-13 21:23:34","2022-07-31 13:39:02","","44-53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000662554700015","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Generative adversarial networks; Big Data; data cleaning; Training; Conferences; adversarial deep learning; ERROR; few-shot learning; graphs","","Wu, XT; Jermaine, C; Xiong, L; Hu, XH; Kotevska, O; Lu, SY; Xu, WJ; Aluru, S; Zhai, CX; Al-Masri, E; Chen, ZY; Saltz, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It plays an important role in traffic information service and traffic guidance. However, complex traffic systems are highly nonlinear and stochastic, making short-term traffic flow prediction a challenging issue. Although long short-term memory (LSTM) has a good performance in traffic flow prediction, the impact of temporal features on prediction has not been exploited by existing studies. In this paper, a temporal information enhancing LSTM (T-LSTM) is proposed to predict traffic flow of a single road section. In view of the similar characteristics of traffic flow at the same time each day, the model can improve prediction accuracy by capturing the intrinsic correlation between traffic flow and temporal information. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the prediction performance and obtain higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel missing data processing technique based on T-LSTM. According to the experimental results, this technique can well restore the characteristics of original data and improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction.","2019","2022-06-13 21:23:36","2022-07-31 04:09:16","","98053-98060","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000480325200001","","","","","","","Recurrent neural networks; LSTM; deep learning; Computational modeling; Data models; Predictive models; Autoregressive processes; Market research; SYSTEMS; MODELS; DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS; missing data repair; temporal features; Traffic flow prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The industrial sensor-cloud system (SCS) has also received widespread attention. In the future, a large number of integrated sensors that simultaneously collect multifeature data will be added to industrial SCS. However, the collected big data are not trustworthy due to the harsh environment of the sensor. If the data collected at the bottom networks are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, the query and data mining results will be inaccurate, which will seriously affect the judgment and feedback of the cloud. The traditional method of relying on sensor nodes for data cleaning is insufficient to deal with big data, whereas edge computing provides a good solution. In this article, a new data cleaning method is proposed based on the mobile edge node during data collection. An angle-based outlier detection method is applied at the edge node to obtain the training data of the cleaning model, which is then established through support vector machine. Besides, online learning is adopted for model optimization. Experimental results show that multidimensional data cleaning based on mobile edge nodes improves the efficiency of data cleaning while maintaining data reliability and integrity, and greatly reduces the bandwidth and energy consumption of the industrial SCS.","2020-02","2022-06-13 21:23:37","2022-07-31 14:44:47","","1321-1329","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000521337000057","","","","","","","Cleaning; Cloud computing; Wireless sensor networks; Edge computing; Data cleaning; edge computing; Computational modeling; Data models; Sensors; BLOCKCHAIN; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); industrial sensor-cloud; online machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, anomaly detection and classification in mobile networks has become a challenging task due to the unknown distributions exhibited by the collected data and the lack of interpretability of the embedded (machine learning) models. This paper proposes an unsupervised end-to-end methodology based on both a data cleaning strategy and explainable machine learning models to detect and classify performance anomalies in mobile networks. The proposed approach, dubbed clean and explainable anomaly detection and classification (KLNX), aims at identifying attributes and operation scenarios that could induce anomalous KPI values without resorting to parameter tuning. Unlike previous methodologies, the proposed method includes a data cleaning stage that extracts and removes experiments and attributes considered outliers in order to train the anomaly detection engine with the cleanest possible dataset. Additionally, machine learning models provide interpretable information about features and boundaries describing both the normal network behavior and the anomalous scenarios. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a testbed generating synthetic data is developed using a known TCP throughput model. Finally, the methodology is assessed on a real data set captured by operational tests in commercial networks.","2022","2022-07-27 17:24:58","2022-07-31 14:36:56","","103-12","","","","","","","2022 20th Mediterranean Communication and Computer Networking Conference (MedComNet).","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MedComNet55087.2022.9810378","Cleaning; data handling; unsupervised learning; Throughput; Data models; Task analysis; Training data; data preprocessing; mobile communication; telecommunication network performance; telecommunication security; anomaly detection and classification; Behavioral sciences; explainable machine learning; Key performance indicator; mobile networks.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address the challenges of mass spectrum-sensing data and limited transmission capacity of the links from spectrum-sensing satellites to the GW, we propose a method called joint anomalous data repairing and deep convolutional neural network based spectrum reconstruction (ADRD-SR), which can reconstruct the original spectrum-sensing data from the incomplete data. Specifically, the GW preprocesses the incomplete data using the anomalous data repairing algorithm. A deep convolutional neural network is constructed and well trained, then it is activated to reconstruct the preprocessed spectrum data. Additionally, to sustain good reconstruction performance by tracing the dynamical spectrum-sensing data, we design a real-time evaluation oriented spectrum reconstruction framework, through seeking the events when the mean absolute error (MAE) becomes larger than a predefined threshold. Furthermore, the ADRD-SR method can reduce the MAE by more than 68% over the conventional reconstruction methods. Moreover, the reconstructed spectrum data can be used to assist spectrum sensing, and the corresponding probability of correct detection is only degraded by 5% even when 75% of the data is discarded.","2022","2022-07-27 18:22:44","2022-07-31 04:17:09","","1-1","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Convolutional neural networks; Signal to noise ratio; Training; Data models; Logic gates; deep convolutional neural network; Sensors; Satellites; Anomalous data repairing; spectrum reconstruction; spectrum sensing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the YOLOv4 model was used to locate the defect and glass region of interest (ROI) in panel images, and a semantic segmentation model (FCN-VGG16) was used to identify defect and glass pixel positions in the ROI. Finally, the effective cutting range of faults was determined using overlap and nonoverlap cutting (ON-cutting) judgment methods.

We implement the new applications of machine learning in teaching and learning considering the students background, students past academic score and considering other attributes. As the sizes of classes are large, it would be difficult to assist each individual student in each open learning course, this can increase the bar of the dropout rate at the end of the course. In this paper we are implementing linear regression which is a machine learning algorithm to predict the student's performance in academics.","2020-06-05","2022-07-27 18:23:29","2022-07-27 18:23:29","","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)","","","","Machine learning; Support vector machines; Data visualization; Linear regression; Data cleaning; Machine learning algorithms; Prediction algorithms; Machine Learning; Education; Classification Prediction; Data Processing; Linear Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 International Conference for Emerging Technology (INCET)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Equipment failure and human intervention are the main factors leading abnormal data of power curve, resulting in serious deterioration of the data availability. In order to solve the negative impact of abnormal data, a novel data cleaning framework is proposed for wind turbine systems. First, the nonlinear regression model between the wind speed and the power is established by the back propagation (BP) neural network. Then, the distances between the real data and the nonlinear regression model are approximated by employing the designed auxiliary points. The candidate abnormal data and the current normal data are separated by a threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in descending order. At the same time, based on the set of candidate abnormal data, the candidate normal data is selected through another threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in ascending order. On the basic of both the current normal data and the candidate normal data, the neural network based on iterative learning is applied to update the nonlinear regression model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified upon two sets of data collected by real wind turbine systems.","2021-05-22","2022-07-27 18:23:29","2022-07-31 03:01:44","","714-718","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","","; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601788; http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601788","Cleaning; Backpropagation; Deterioration; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Sorting; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; data cleaning; Training; Data models; neural network; Wind energy; wind power curve; Wind speed; Wind turbine system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 33rd Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even the meteorology domain is not an exception; the modeling of precipitation activity is markedly stochastic and is influenced by a number of related physical variables (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind). Accurate precipitation estimation is thus highly non-trivial. Today's technical capability, automated data measuring (whether using Radar or automatic meteorological stations), as well as subsequent large-scale data processing and regression model training, allow the meteorological estimations and predictions with increasing accuracy. This paper demonstrates selected uses of artificial neural networks in the field of meteorology, as well as solving problems with pre-processing and integrating time-spatial meteorological data.","2019-11-20","2022-07-27 18:23:30","2022-07-27 18:23:30","","000089-000094","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2019 IEEE 15th International Scientific Conference on Informatics","","","","Machine learning; Data integration; Data mining; Meteorology; Data cleaning; Atmospheric modeling; Neural network; Temperature measurement; Modeling; Rainfall estimation; Time-spatial data; Meteorological radar; Reflectivity; Sea measurements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE 15th International Scientific Conference on Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model consists of two one-way prediction models. In each prediction model, the original wind speed data are decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue signal by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. Then the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter is used to reduce noise for high-frequency IMFs. Next the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model are combined to predict low-frequency IMFs and the noise reduction results respectively. At the end, all those forecast results are added and form a one-way result. By weighted average of two one -way results, the repairing result is calculated. The experimental results from multiple prediction cases show that this method can get more accurate results.","2021-01-22","2022-07-27 18:23:30","2022-07-27 18:23:30","","715-721","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Computer Applications (ICPECA)","","","","Data models; Predictive models; Maintenance engineering; Wind speed; data repairing; Distributed databases; autoregressive integrated moving average; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; long short-term memory neural network; Savitzky–Golay filter; Wind forecasting; Wind power generation; wind speed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Computer Applications (ICPECA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While supervised classification tasks demonstrate promising classification performance, a particular challenge is how to ensure the confidence for collecting labelled data. This paper presents a semi-supervised approach via label confidence for traffic sign classification to avoid the interference of uncertain labelled data. The idea of the proposed approach is to compare unsupervised information of the data, the supervised information carried by the learning data, and the supervised information which is given by the classification model in order to detect inconsistencies. The approach is able to build a robust classification model. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing approaches when uncertain labelled data exists.","2020-07-20","2022-07-27 18:23:30","2022-07-27 18:23:30","","926-931","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE 18th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","","","","Cleaning; Data models; label noise; Data Cleaning; Conferences; Benchmark testing; Transportation; Robustness; Interference; semi-supervised learning; uncertain labels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE 18th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, Big Data analytics (BDA) is used to analyze the sheer volume of data available in an organization. These data quality must be maintained in order to obtain correct alert and valuable insights from the rapidly changing data of high volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. This paper aim is to modify existing framework of big data analytics by improving an important step in pre-processing (i.e. Data Cleaning). Initially, feature selection based on Random Forest is used to extract effective features. Then, two classifier algorithms (i.e. Random Forest classifier and Linear SVM classifier) are applied to train using the dataset to classify data quality and to develop an intelligent model. In evaluation, our experimental results show a consistent accuracy of Random Forest and Linear Regression around 90%. Using this approach, we expect to provide a set of cleaned data for further processing. Besides, analysts can benefit from this system in data analytical process in cleaning stage and conclude that the data is cleaned. Finally, a comparison is presented between available functions which are used to handle missing values with the developed system.","2018-09-19","2022-07-27 18:23:31","2022-07-27 18:23:31","","208-213","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2018 7th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","","","","Big data; Cleaning; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Feature extraction; Forestry; Data Analytics; Big Data; data cleaning; Training; Data models; Random Forest; Gini Index; missing data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 7th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
