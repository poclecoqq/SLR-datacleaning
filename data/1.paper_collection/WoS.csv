In addition, there are limitations such as error detection due to external factors, and there is also a disadvantage that it is difficult to accurately distinguish between various objects. This paper uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to recognize and classify object images of very small moths and obtain precise data images. A convolution neural network algorithm is used for image data classification, and the classified image is transformed into image data to learn the topological structure of the image. To improve the accuracy of the image classification and reduce the loss rate, a parameter for finding a fast-optimal point of image classification is set by a convolutional neural network and a pixel image as a preprocessor. As a result of this study, we applied a convolution neural network algorithm to classify the images of very small moths by capturing precise images of the moths.

In order to reduce the log-average miss rate of the object under different illumination conditions, a new one-stage detector suitable for multispectral pedestrian detection is proposed. First, in order to realize the complementarity between the information flows of the two modalities in the feature extraction stage to reduce the object loss, a low-cost cross-modality feature complementary module (CFCM) is proposed. Second, in order to suppress the background noise in different environments and enhance the semantic information and location information of the object, so as to reduce the error detection of the object, an attention-based feature enhancement fusion module (AFEFM) is proposed. Thirdly, through the feature complementarity of color-thermal image pair and the multi-scale fusion of depth feature layer, the horizontal and vertical multi-dimensional data mining of parallel deep neural network is realized, which provides effective data support for object detection algorithm. Finally, through the reasonable arrangement of proposed modules, a robust multispectral detection framework is proposed. The experimental results on the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) pedestrian benchmark show that the proposed method has the lowest log-average miss rate compared with other state-of-the-art multispectral pedestrian detectors, and has a good balance in speed and accuracy.  2013 IEEE.","2022","2022-08-10 17:40:40","2022-08-10 19:14:31","","53797-53809","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3175303","Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Data mining; Semantics; Extraction; Object detection; Object recognition; Job analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper constructs a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning to perform piston error sensing on a single focal plane image. First, a batch of data sets that introduce piston error generates according to the principle of sparse aperture imaging. The image features are extracted through the pre-training network, and the mapping relationship between the features and the corresponding piston error values is established. When a given single image is sent to the network for processing, then get corresponding piston error value via search with the nearest neighbors. The simulation results verify the method's effectiveness and measure the piston error of the 1 dynamic range. Because this detection method can perform piston error sensing tasks without introducing additional measuring equipment, it dramatically reduces the complexity and hardware cost of the optical system. It may be used as a new piston error detection technology in the future.  2021 SPIE","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:02","2022-08-10 19:22:44","","Institute of Optics and Electronics (IOE), Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Chinese Optical Society (COS)","","","12070","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","SPIE","Chengdu, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2604013","Error detection; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Convolution; Transfer learning; Optical data processing; Pistons; Optical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most piston detection methods based on neural networks are difficult to achieve high accuracy. In this Letter, we propose a high-precision piston error detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). A system with six sub-mirrors is used, and one of the sub-mirrors is set as the reference mirror. The network can simultaneously extract the piston information of the remaining five sub-mirrors to be tested from the point spread function (PSF). In the training phase, five sub-mirrors are set with 10,000 groups of random piston values with a range slightly less than one wavelength, and PSF images can be acquired accordingly. Then, 10,000 PSF images with corresponding piston errors are used to train the network. After training, we only need to input a PSF image into the pre-trained network, and the piston can be obtained directly. It is verified by simulation that the average piston's measurement error of five submirrors is just 0.0089 RMS (=632nm). In addition, this end-to-end method based on deep learning extremely reduces the complexity of the optical system, and just need to set a mask with a sparse multi-subaperture configuration in the conjugate plane of the segmented mirror. This method is accurate and fast, and can be widely used to detect the piston in phasing telescope arrays or segmented mirrors.  2021 SPIE","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:04","2022-08-10 19:20:11","","Chinese Society for Optical Engineering (CSOE); Science and Technology on Low-light-level Night Vision Laboratory","","","11763","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","SPIE","Kunming, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2587641","Deep learning; Error detection; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Telescopes; Optical transfer function; Pistons; Mirrors; Optical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classification and analysis of the input imagery requires prior training and assisted error detection to improve the accuracy. In this article, pre-trained Gaussian mixture model (PGMM) is introduced for improving the accuracy of EEG signal imagery analysis. The proposed model relies on deep learning classifiers for analyzing the imagery using pixel based segmentation through pre-training models. The errors in classification are identified through recurrent convolution neural network training process as aided by the extracted features.

Most recent works show that visual information can boost the NER performance since images can provide complementary contextual information for texts. However, the image-level features ignore the mapping relations between fine-grained visual objects and textual entities, which results in error detection in entities with different types. To better exploit visual and textual information in NER, we propose an adversarial gated bilinear attention neural network (AGBAN). The model jointly extracts entity-related features from both visual objects and texts, and leverages an adversarial training to map two different representations into a shared representation. As a result, domain information contained in an image can be transferred and applied for extracting named entities in the text associated with the image. Experimental results on Tweets dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed gated bilinear attention network in capturing the interactions of mutimodal features visual objects and textual words. Our results indicate that the adversarial training can effectively exploit commonalities across heterogeneous data sources, which leads to improved performance in NER when compared to models purely exploiting text data or combining the image-level visual features.  1999-2012 IEEE.","2021","2022-08-10 17:41:34","2022-08-10 19:22:24","","2520-2532","","","23","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2020.3013398","Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Image enhancement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the widespread use of English and an increasing number of English words, near-form words have also increased. However, the traditional way of identifying near-form words cannot keep up with this ever-growing language. A mathematical algorithm is therefore needed which can calculate the degree of similarity between words, so that near-form words can then be identified, collected and classified according to appearance similarity, and a specific value can be assigned to these levels of similarity. In related fields, there have been many studies of English synonyms, phonetic words, English sentences and texts. Some algorithms have been used with the aim of studying similarities in word appearance, but these were for hieroglyphics, such as Chinese words, and not for English words. Many similar words can be found in dictionaries or networks which are incomplete due to the outcomes of subjective collection. More importantly, subjective collection methods cannot determine the value of similarities, which highlights the uniqueness and innovation of this research. Among existing research methods, the one used most often involves fuzzy neural networks, which are unstable and inaccurate. A stable and unique mathematical calculation method is therefore needed. In this study, coding methods were used to design an algorithm that could calculate different letter position coefficients and letter appearance coefficients in order to obtain corresponding values. In terms of application, this algorithm can help generate big data on near-form words in English teaching. In terms of English input software, this algorithm can also provide more words to prompt the input method. In the case of text-editing software (such as Microsoft Word), the algorithm can improve error-detection accuracy and suggest suitable alternatives. In the field of artificial intelligence, it can also be used to monitor counterfeit trademark registration in the commodity registration system. Thus, the authors firmly believe that this application will have a wide range of applications in the future.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2022","2022-08-10 17:41:35","2022-08-10 19:13:44","","","","","","","","","Journal of Supercomputing","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-022-04511-6","Fuzzy neural networks; Codes (symbols); Crime; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urban plantation has realistic demands for single tree management such as catkin pollution, maintenance of famous trees, landscape construction, and park management. At present, there are problems of missed detection and error detection in dense plantations and complex background plantations. This paper proposes a single tree detection method based on single shot multibox detector (SSD). Optimal SSD is obtained by adjusting feature layers, optimizing the aspect ratio of a preset box, reducing parameters and so on. The optimal SSD is applied to single tree detection and location in campuses, orchards, and economic plantations. The average accuracy based on SSD is 96.0, 92.9, and 97.6% in campus green trees, lychee plantations, and palm plantations, respectively. It is 11.3 and 37.5% higher than the latest template matching method and chan-vese (CV) model method, and is 43.1 and 54.2% higher than the traditional watershed method and local maximum method. Experimental results show that SSD has a strong potential and application advantage. This research has reference significance for the application of an object detection framework based on deep learning in agriculture and forestry.

Therefore, it is the key to avoiding the false alarm of the monitoring system due to the anomaly of the data itself. Data cleansing consists of two parts: anomaly identification and anomaly repair. However, current research on data cleansing has mainly focused on anomaly identification and lacks efficient data repair methods. The key to data repair lies in sensor correlation models based on mapping relationships between sensors. To obtain a good inter-sensor relationship model, it is first necessary to exclude anomalous data from the training data set used for modeling. Therefore, a two-stage data cleansing framework for collaborative multi-sensor repair is proposed. First, based on the analysis of anomalous features of GPS data, a bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network model is adopted for data anomalies classification and localization. As a result, the data segment to be repaired is determined. Then, on the basis of all sensor data in the time range of the day before the target repair data segment, the data set for data repair is constructed by excluding the anomaly data segments in the data set with the help of the above anomaly identification results. Then, a conditional generation adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed to achieve data repair. Experimental validation shows that the two-stage data cleansing method of identification followed by repair can accurately identify and repair GPS anomalies. Finally, several factors affecting the repair effect are discussed. 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:03","2022-07-31 01:45:08","","","","","","","","","Structural Control and Health Monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/stc.2993","Anomaly detection; Brain; Generative adversarial networks; Global positioning system; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Repair; anomaly detection; data repair; data cleansing; bidirectional long- and short-term memory neural network; conditional generation adversarial network; ONLINE; OUTLIER DETECTION; RECOVERY; REGRESSION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in domain adaptation. However, most of them leverage unlabeled target data only from a statistical perspective but neglect the analysis at the instance level. For better statistical alignment, existing approaches employ the entire unevaluated target data in an unsupervised manner, which may introduce noise and limit the discriminability of the neural networks. In this article, we propose confident learning-based domain adaptation (CLDA) to address the problem from a new perspective of data manipulation. To this end, a novel framework is presented to combine domain adaptation with confident learning (CL), where the former reduces the interdomain discrepancy and generates pseudo-labels for the target instances, from which the latter selects high-confidence target samples. Specifically, the confident learning part evaluates the confidence of each pseudo-labeled target sample based on the assigned labels and the predicted probabilities. Then, high-confidence target samples are selected as training data to increase the discriminative capacity of the neural networks. In addition, the domain adaptation part and the confident learning part are trained alternately to progressively increase the proportion of high-confidence labels in the target domain, thus further improving the accuracy of classification. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLDA method outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.

The ANFIS is a family of the deep learning algorithm, which incorporates the benefits of adaptive control technique, artificial neural network, and the fuzzy inference system. Thus, it is expected to produce very accurate predictions even for the highly nonlinear system. Forced vibration responses of a five-story steel building were simulated by ANFIS and its accuracy was compared with the results of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a type of traditional artificial neural networks. Simulations by ANFIS were very accurate with a much lower root means square error (RMSE) than RNN. Simulated data by ANFIS showed an almost perfect match with the original. Even the small ripples in the power spectrum plot outside the dominant frequency were successfully reproduced. In addition, the ANFIS was used to increase the sampling rate of dynamic data. It was shown that missing high-frequency contents could be successfully reproduced when the ANFIS was properly trained.

As the expansion of data scales, methods such as pre-specifying business rules or introducing expert experience into a repair process are no longer applicable to some information systems requiring rapid responses. In this case, we divided data cleaning into supervised and unsupervised forms according to whether there were interventions in the repair processes and put forward a new dimension suitable for unsupervised cleaning in this paper. For weak logic errors in unsupervised data cleaning, we proposed an attribute correlation-based (ACB)-Framework under blocking, and designed three different data blocking methods to reduce the time complexity and test the impact of clustering accuracy on data cleaning. The experiments showed that the blocking methods could effectively reduce the repair time by maintaining the repair validity. Moreover, we concluded that the blocking methods with a too high clustering accuracy tended to put tuples with the same elements into a data block, which reduced the cleaning ability. In summary, the ACB-Framework with blocking can reduce the corresponding time cost and does not need the guidance of domain knowledge or interventions in repair, which can be applied in information systems requiring rapid responses, such as internet web pages, network servers, and sensor information acquisition.","2019-04","2022-06-10 02:09:06","2022-07-31 03:35:09","","575 (25 pp.)","","4","11","","Symmetry","","Symmetry (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym11040575","business data processing; data handling; database management systems; information systems; Internet; pattern clustering; unsupervised learning; machine learning; data quality; attribute correlation; data blocking; RULE-BASED METHOD; unsupervised data cleaning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data-driven approaches, such as deep learning and machine learning, are promising in constructing the gesture generation model, which automatically provides the gesture motion for speech or spoken texts. This study experimentally analyzes a deep learning-based gesture generation model from spoken text using a convolutional neural network. The proposed model takes a sequence of spoken words as the input and outputs a sequence of 2D joint coordinates representing the conversational gesture motion. We prepare a dataset consisting of gesture motions and spoken texts by adding text information to an existing dataset and train the models using specific speaker's data. The quality of the generated gestures is compared with those from an existing speech-to-gesture generation model through a user perceptual study. The subjective evaluation shows that the model performance is comparable or superior to those by the existing speech-to-gesture generation model. In addition, we investigate the importance of data cleansing and loss function selection in the text-to-gesture generation model. We further examine the model transferability between speakers. The experimental results demonstrate successful model transferability of the proposed model. Finally, we show that the text-to-gesture generation model can produce good quality gestures even when using a transformer architecture.  2022 The Author(s)","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:06","2022-07-31 13:53:44","","365-375","","","151","","Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2022.03.041","Deep learning; Network architecture; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Gesture generation; Spoken text; Transformer architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:06","2022-07-31 14:18:07","","16153-16164","","21","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016297","Big data; Cleaning; Deep learning; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Feature extraction; Health care; Internet of things; feature selection; Internet of Things; Training; Correlation; Deep Q-network (DQN); multisourced data; Mutual information; reinforcement learning; Smart cities; ALGORITHM; ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY; MUTUAL INFORMATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these issues, we propose a new image data cleaning framework using deep neural networks, named ImageDC, to improve the quality of the datasets.

We first discuss the theoretical background to this data-cleansing methodology in the classification problem of an artificial neural network (ANN). Then, we discuss how the PCA is used in data-cleansing techniques through a sample reduction process (SRP) using various publicly available biomedical datasets with different samples and feature sizes. Lastly, the cleaned datasets were tested through the following: PCA-SRP in ANN accuracy comparison testing, sensitivity vs. specificity testing, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve testing, and accuracy vs. additional random sample testing. The results show a significant improvement in the classification of ANNs using the developed methodology and suggested a recommended range of selectivity (Sc) factors for typical cleaning and ANN applications.

This paper presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs.

In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CORDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CORDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CORDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2% on public benchmark datasets.

In this paper, we used confident learning (CL) to incorporate sample-uncertainty information into our mortality prediction models and evaluated the performance of these models using a large dataset of 139,367 unique ICU admissions within the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD).

Machine learning applications are not limited to autonomous cars or robotics but are widely used in almost all sectors including finance, healthcare, entertainment, government systems, telecommunications, and many others. Due to a lack of enterprise ML strategy, many enterprises still repeat the tedious steps and spend most of the time massaging the required data. It is easier to access a variety of data because of big data lakes and data democratization. Despite it and decent advances in ML, engineers still spend significant time in data cleansing and feature engineering. Most of the steps are often repeated in this exercise. As a result, it generates identical features with variations that lead to inconsistent results in testing and training ML applications. It often stretches the time to go-live and increases the number of iterations to ship a final ML application. Sharing the best practices and best features are not only time-savers but they also help to jumpstart ML application development. The democratization of ML features is a powerful way to share useful features, to reduce time go-live, and to enable rapid ML application development. It is one of the emerging trends in enterprise ML application development and this paper presents details about a way to achieve ML feature democratization.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:09:09","2022-07-31 04:02:36","","136-141","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE 21st International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science, IRI 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Las Vegas, NV, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IRI49571.2020.00027","Machine learning; Data Science; Data integration; Information use; Telecommunication industry; Big Data; Training; Data models; Distributed databases; Big Data Analytics; Best practices; Democratize Feature; Feature Store; Machine Learning Development; ML Pipelines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are even being tested in safety-critical systems, thanks to recent breakthroughs in deep learning and reinforcement learning. Many people are now interacting with systems based on ML every day, e.g., voice recognition systems used by virtual personal assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. As the field of ML continues to grow, we are likely to witness transformative advances in a wide range of areas, from finance, energy, to health and transportation. Given this growing importance of ML-based systems in our daily life, it is becoming utterly important to ensure their reliability. Recently, software researchers have started adapting concepts from the software testing domain (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing, or property-based testing) to help ML engineers detect and correct faults in ML programs. This paper reviews current existing testing practices for ML programs. First, we identify and explain challenges that should be addressed when testing ML programs. Next, we report existing solutions found in the literature for testing ML programs. Finally, we identify gaps in the literature related to the testing of ML programs and make recommendations of future research directions for the scientific community. We hope that this comprehensive review of software testing practices will help ML engineers identify the right approach to improve the reliability of their ML-based systems.

Advances in machine learning techniques have allowed researchers to make substantial gains in tackling complex problems in diverse fields such as medical diagnosis through image analysis, object detection and tracking, and natural language processing. However, often researchers only employ one or two machine learning algorithms with a static feature set while only testing a single hypothesis. This self-imposed bottleneck often produces suboptimal results because it arises from using machine learning within the classical, algorithmic context using existing development tools. Therefore, there is a need to create new development tools which reflect this change to the machine learning paradigm. In this research, we propose a development environment that allows researchers to leverage those capabilities more fully by shifting not only the tool they use but also their mindset. Our proposed environment serves as an intermediate tool, guiding the researcher and making full adoption of the machine learning paradigm throughout the software development process easier. To accomplish this, our framework is defined by a three-layer structure designed for subject domain assessment, data manipulation and feature set exploration. Supported by parallelism, data cleaning and feature engineering, this research provides a conceptual basis for future creation of development environments for the machine learning paradigm. Future development of such a conceptual design would allow for additional intelligent tools to aid the user in designing solutions and support reusability at the design level.  2022 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:09:10","2022-07-30 22:28:49","","329-331","","","2022-March","","","","Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Mobile, AL, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SoutheastCon48659.2022.9764094","Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Software design; Diagnosis; Natural language processing systems; Medical imaging; Object detection; machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Software; Focusing; Natural language processing; Reusability; development environment; Parallel processing; software development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Curating Contextually Fair Data To Reduce Model Bias","2022 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 4-8 Jan. 2022","","","10.1109/WACV51458.2022.00395","","Contextual information is a valuable cue for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn better representations and improve accuracy. However, co-occurrence bias in the training dataset may hamper a DNNmodel's generalizabil- ity to unseen scenarios in the real world. For example, in COCO [26], many object categories have a much higher cooccurrence with men compared to women, which can bias a DNN's prediction in favor of men. Recent works have focused on task-specific training strategies to handle bias in such scenarios, but fixing the available data is often ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel and more generic solution to address the contextual bias in the datasets by selecting a subset of the samples, which is fair in terms of the co-occurrence with various classes for a protected attribute. We introduce a data repair algorithm using the coefficient of variation( cv), which can curate fair and contextually balanced data for a protected class(es). This helps in training a fair model irrespective of the task, architecture or training methodology. Our proposed solution is simple, effective and can even be used in an active learning setting where the data labels are not present or being generated incrementally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of object detection and multi-label image classification across different datasets. Through a series of experiments, we validate that curating contextually fair data helps make model predictions fair by balancing the true positive rate for the protected class across groups without compromising on the model's overall performance.

To overcome the above problem, an efficient and accurate data anomaly detection method is desiderated. Traditional anomaly detection methods extract various abnormal features as the key indicators to identify data anomalies. Then set thresholds artificially for various features to identify specific anomalies, which is the artificial experience method. However, limited by the poor generalization ability among sensors, this method often leads to high labor costs. Another approach to anomaly detection is a data-driven approach based on machine learning methods. Among these, the bidirectional long-short memory neural network (BiLSTM), as an effective classification method, excels at finding complex relationships in multivariate time series data. However, training unprocessed original signals often leads to low computation efficiency and poor convergence, for lacking appropriate feature selection. Therefore, this article combines the advantages of the two methods by proposing a deep learning method with manual experience statistical features fed into it. Experimental comparative studies illustrate that the BiLSTM model with appropriate feature input has an accuracy rate of over 87-94%. Meanwhile, this paper provides basic principles of data cleaning and discusses the typical features of various anomalies. Furthermore, the optimization strategies of the feature space selection based on artificial experience are also highlighted.

From the point of view of engineering and data analytics, this quantity of data presents an opportunity to understand the operation of the system under normal conditions or to explore new ways of operation by using information from models provided by using deep learning approaches.

To ensure the data reliability, many noise mitigation technologies have been proposed. However, they only mitigate one of the noises of the NAND flash memory channel. In this paper, we consider all the main noises and present a novel neural network-assisted error correction (ANNAEC) scheme to increase the reliability of multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory. To avoid using retention time as an input parameter of the neural network, we propose a relative log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to estimate the actual LLR. Then, we trans-form the bit detection into a clustering problem and propose to employ a neural network to learn the error characteristics of the NAND flash memory channel. Therefore, the trained neural network has optimized performances of bit error detection.

Therefore, hotspot identification of crimes by analysing real-time dataset has become essential and will significantly benefit the public by accurately analysing the dangerous locations. This paper aims to develop the framework model for identifying criminal hotspots using a modified K-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm by considering different crime characteristics like the severity of the crime, frequency of crime and temporal data of crime by visualising hotspots using geographic information system (GIS). This study analyses the real dataset of crime for the recent five years collected from the Commissioner of Police of Gurgaon, Haryana. The data cleaning and pre-processing strategies have been applied to make data ready for further training the model. The results demonstrate locations of the different hotspots based on the density of crime occurrences, and accurate visualisation of hotspots using GIS display is done by supervised learning and unsupervised classifiers.

Defect layer identification is a labor-intensive task that requires domain knowledge of experts to make consistent decisions over multiple datasets. Sometimes, it also requires examining multiple sources of inspection images to make the final identification. In this paper, we propose a multimodal machine learning model for defect layer identification as a classification problem from multiple sources of input images. After training two single modal models from each input source, we develop a final joint fusion model to achieve the best classification performance. This work also demonstrates how to estimate the final fusion model performance without exhaustively trying all possible combinations of single modal models. In order to integrate the approach into an industrial display manufacturing defect data analytic, we propose the data coverage model, which guarantees human-level classification performance within a certain portion of data. The data coverage model improves the robustness of the multimodal model, utilizing confident learning to make a high-confidence predictions for the particle defect layer identification and adding a filter to assess whether data samples are within the coverage based on the model's latent space density estimation. This work uses particle defects data samples in 8 different layers as a combination of TEM and STEM images from display manufacturing fabrication lines. Our experimental results show that the classification accuracy improves substantially by deploying the proposed multimodal model. The results also show that it is possible to implement the data coverage model to achieve the human expert level of defect layer classification for a portion of data to automate the task.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 03:18:07","","","","","2021-May","","","","ASMC (Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference) Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Milpitas, CA, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASMC51741.2021.9435664","Machine learning; Process control; Semiconductor device manufacture; Defects; Analytical models; Training; Predictive models; Image processing; Data coverage model; Display defect layer classification; Fabrication; Multimodal machine learning; Semiconductor device modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional data sorting cannot meet the growing demand of MCF research because of the low-efficiency, time-delay, and lack of objective criteria. In this paper, a Time-Domain Global Similarity (TDGS) method based on machine learning technologies is proposed for the automatic data cleaning of MCF devices. The aim of traditional data sorting is to classify original diagnostic data sequences. The lengths and evolution properties of the data sequences vary shot by shot. Hence the classification criteria are affected by many discharge parameters and are different in various discharges. The focus of the TDGS method is turned to the physical similarity between data sequences from different channels, which are more independent of discharge parameters. The complexity arisen from real discharge parameters during data cleaning is avoided in the TDGS method by transforming the general data sorting problem into a binary classification problem about the physical similarity between data sequences. As a demonstration of its application to multi-channel measurement systems, the TDGS method is applied to the EAST POlarimeterINTerferometer (POINT) system.

In order to solve these problems, a malicious mining detection system based on network timing signals is proposed. When capturing network traffic, the system does not need to know the contents of data packets but only collects network flow timing signals, which greatly protects the privacy of users. Besides, we use the campus network to carry out experiments, collect a large amount of network traffic data generated by mining behavior, and carry out feature extraction and data cleaning. We also collect traffic data of normal network behavior and combine them after labeling. Then, we use four machine learning algorithms for classification.

In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a short-term wind power prediction method based on data cleaning and feature reconfiguration is proposed. A large number of historical samples consisting of wind direction, wind speed, and wind power are mapped into a multidimensional sample space, and the distribution of wind data in different dimensions are analyzed in depth. By calculating the local density of each sample, outliers are effectively detected. The features of wind are reconfigured into a global information map combined with the time series information, which reflects the variation of the wind process in the short term. The features of the original data are greatly enriched, providing a high-quality training set for the prediction model. A redesigned convolutional neural network was used to predict short-term wind power, and the proposed methods were trained and tested based on a dataset of a real wind farm in China. Data cleaning and feature reconfiguration reduce the average single-point error by 1.38% and 2.56%, respectively, while the combined method reduced it by 6.24%. Plenty of experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve good performance and effectively improve the accuracy of short-term wind power prediction.  2021","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:37","2022-07-31 04:20:22","","","","","292","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116851","Cleaning; Neural networks; Wind; Wind power; Convolution; Economics; Weather forecasting; Data cleaning; Convolutional neural network; Feature reconfiguration; Local density; Short-term wind power prediction; ALGORITHM; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DECOMPOSITION; ELECTRICITY; SIMULATION; SPEED PREDICTION; TURBINES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decision to blacklist an IP address requires careful examination of various aspects of packet traffic data as well as the behavioral history. Most of the current security monitoring for IP blacklisting heavily relies on the domain expertise from experienced specialists. Although there are efforts to apply machine-learning (ML) techniques to this problem, we are yet to see the mature solution. To mitigate these challenges and to gain better understanding of the problem, we have designed the BlackEye framework in which we can apply various ML techniques and produce models for accurate blacklisting. From our analysis results, we learn that multi-staged method that combines the data cleansing and the classification via logistic regression or random forest produces the best results. Our evaluation on the real-world data shows that it can reduce the the incorrect blacklisting by nearly 90% when compared to the performance of experts.

In this paper, in line with the low-rank sparse matrix decomposition model, a fast anomaly cleaning algorithm based on a deep neural network is proposed to solve the Spatio-temporal data cleaning problem in IoT. Both the Spatio-temporal correlation of sensing data and the abnormal values' sparsity are considered in an optimization problem. The Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) is used to solve it. Then the ISTA is unfolded into a fixed-length deep neural network.

This paper establishes a data cleaning framework that is based on data mining and deep learning to eliminate abnormal data points and interpolate missing points to improve the accuracy of the original road inspection dataset. The first process in the proposed framework is to analyse the influential factors that are used to evaluate data quality and calculate the abnormality of the data through the confidence interval used in Gaussian fitting. Then, a deep artificial neural network is established to learn the mapping between the inspection data and data abnormality. The abnormal points are removed according to their abnormality level. Next, a second deep artificial neural network predicts the missing point values. Finally, by defining the overall cleanliness index of the dataset as the optimisation target, the steps are repeated until the cleanliness threshold is met. In this study, the proposed framework was applied to rut depth data cleaning for a highway maintenance project in Jiangsu Province, China.

This has a significant impact on a broad range of applications that are characterized by massive working sets and real-time constraints. However, it is challenging and burdensome for human operators to hand-tune various control-knobs in a cloud-scale storage cluster for maintaining optimal performance under diverse workload conditions. Our study on an open-source object-based storage system, Ceph, shows that common load balancing strategies are ineffective unless they are adapted according to workload characteristics. Furthermore, positive effects of an applied strategy may not be immediately visible. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning based system adaptation technique that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks. In particular, we applied a stochastic policy gradient based reinforcement learning technique to track performance hotspots in the storage cluster, and take appropriate corrective actions to maximize future performance under a variety of complex scenarios. For this purpose, we leveraged system-level performance monitoring and commonly available control-knobs in object-based cloud storage systems. We implemented the developed techniques to build an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) system for object based storage cluster, and evaluated its performance on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed. Experiments using Cloud Object Storage Benchmark (COSBench) show that, ARM improves the average read and write response time of Ceph storage cluster by upto 50% and 33% respectively, compared to the default case. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic load rebalancing technique in terms of read and write performance of Ceph storage by 43% and 36% respectively.  2019 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-31 03:53:28","","34-44","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2019","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Prague, Czech republic","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IC2E.2019.000-9","Open systems; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Cloud computing; Stochastic systems; Digital storage; Information management; Balancing; Dynamic loads; Knobs; Storage as a service (STaaS); Storage management; Task analysis; Hardware; Servers; Interference; Ceph; Cloud Storage; Load management; Performance Interference; Reinforcement Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we use the systematic sampling method to obtain Douban's social media data. Because there are many abnormal users in these data, they are real but false data for personal credit evaluation. In order to better carry out personal credit scoring, we propose three criteria, power exponents of time interval distribution of individual user i, user activity Ai, and the ratio of out-degree and in-degree Ri of user i, which are used to systematically clean the data. And then, we used the logistic regression method to score the individual credits of users before and after data cleaning, and found that the rank order of personal credit scoring has changed significantly. This change is largely attributed to the changes of network structure after data cleaning. We believe that our work is very important to use the social media data to establish a credible personal credit evaluation system to reduce the credit risk of the current Internet financial industry.  2001-2011 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-31 03:01:36","","7-15","","2","35","","IEEE Intelligent Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2020.2972214","Cleaning; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Social networking (online); Logistic regression; Risk assessment; Intelligent systems; Data cleaning; Data models; Personal credit scoring; Power-law distribution; Social media data; User activity; COMMUNICATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Security information and event management systems (SIEMs) perform some rudimentary automation but cannot replicate the decision-making process of a skilled analyst. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can detect patterns in data with appropriate training. In practice, the majority of the alert data comprises false alerts, and true alerts form only a small proportion. Consequently, a naive engine that classifies all security alerts into the majority class can yield a superficial high accuracy close to 100%. Without any correction for the class imbalance, the false alerts will dominate algorithmic predictions resulting in poor generalization performance. We propose a machine-learning approach to address the class imbalance problem in multi-appliance security alert data and automate the security alert analysis process performed in security operations centers (SOCs). We first used the neighborhood cleaning rule (NCR) to identify and remove ambiguous, noisy, and redundant false alerts. Then, we applied the support vector machine synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVMSMOTE) to generate synthetic training true alerts. Finally, we fit and evaluated the decision tree and random forest classifiers. In the experiments, using alert data from eight security appliances, we demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly reduce the need for manual auditing, decreasing the number of uninspected alerts and achieving a performance of 99.524% in recall.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:39","2022-07-30 22:36:25","","2119-2127","","","","","","","Proceedings - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2021","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671956","Cleaning; Automation; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Information management; Random forests; Intrusion detection; Big Data; machine learning; data cleaning; Training; Noise measurement; Security; alert fatigue; alert screening; Class imbalance; oversampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an attempt to guarantee data quality, various data cleaning approaches have been proposed to filter out abnormal data entries based on the global data distribution. However, most existing data cleaning approaches are based on a centralized paradigm and thus cannot be applied to future edge-based IoT applications, where each edge node (EN) has only a limited view of the global data distribution. Moreover, the increasing demand for privacy preservation largely prevents ENs from combining their data for centralized cleaning. In this study, we propose a federated data cleaning protocol, coined as FedClean, for edge intelligence (EI) scenarios that is designed to achieve data cleaning without compromising data privacy. More specifically, different ENs first generate Boolean shares of their data and distribute them to two noncolluding servers. These two servers then run the FedClean protocol to privately and efficiently compute the attribute value frequency (AVF) scores of the collected data entries, which are then sorted in ascending order via a bitonic sorting network without revealing their values. As a result, data entries with lower AVF scores are considered as abnormal and filtered out. The security, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are then demonstrated via concrete security analysis and comprehensive experiments.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:40","2022-07-31 03:14:09","","6757-6770","","8","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3027980","Cleaning; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Internet of Things; Data privacy; Data cleaning; Data models; Collaboration; edge intelligence (EI); privacy preserving; Protocols; Servers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning method for effective and efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC. Specifically, this research develops machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of HPFRCC through innovative incorporation of micromechanics, aiming to increase the prediction accuracy and generalization performance by enriching and improving the datasets through data cleaning, principal component analysis (PCA), and K-fold cross-validation. This study considers a total of 14 different mix design variables and predicts the ductility of HPFRCC for the first time, in addition to the compressive and tensile strengths. Different types of machine learning methods are investigated and compared, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The results show that the developed machine learning models can reasonably predict the concerned mechanical properties and can be applied to perform parametric studies for the effects of different mix design variables on the mechanical properties. This study is expected to greatly promote efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC.  2021 by the authors.

However, the demand for high-quality training data is slowing down deep neural nets' wider adoption. To this end, data augmentation (DA), which generates more labeled examples from existing ones, becomes a common technique. Meanwhile, the risk of creating noisy examples and the large space of hyper-parameters make DA less attractive in practice. We introduce Rotom, a multi-purpose data augmentation framework for a range of data management and mining tasks including entity matching, data cleaning, and text classification. Rotom features InvDA, a new DA operator that generates natural yet diverse augmented examples by formulating DA as a seq2seq task. The key technical novelty of Rotom is a meta-learning framework that automatically learns a policy for combining examples from different DA operators, whereby combinatorially reduces the hyper-parameters space. Our experimental results show that Rotom effectively improves a model's performance by combining multiple DA operators, even when applying them individually does not yield performance improvement. With this strength, Rotom outperforms the state-of-the-art entity matching and data cleaning systems in the low-resource settings as well as two recently proposed DA techniques for text classification.  2021 ACM.","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:40","2022-07-31 04:29:44","","1303-1316","","","","","","","Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Virtual, Online, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3457258","Cleaning; Deep learning; Classification (of information); Deep neural networks; Information management; Text mining; entity matching, error detection, data augmentation, deep learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This drives commercial decision making and exploration, but the industry relies upon highly manual workflows when processing data. A question is whether this can be improved using machine learning, complementing the activities of petrophysicists searching for hydrocarbons. In this paper, we present work using supervised learning with the aim of decreasing the petrophysical interpretation time down from over 7 days to 7 minutes. We describe the use of mathematical models that have been trained using raw well log data, to complete each of the four stages of a petrophysical interpretation workflow, in addition to initial data cleaning. We explore how the predictions from these models compare against the interpretations of human petrophysicists, and numerous options and techniques that were used to optimize the models.

In this study, a deep learning method to repair atmospheric environmental quality data based on Gaussian diffusion and gate recurrent unit (GD-GRU) was developed to improve repair accuracy. A multi-source Gaussian diffusion model was developed to estimate PM2.5 based on the pollutant diffusion law and the data of 61 stations in Guilin. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated and observed value was extracted as the error sequence. The error value was regarded as output of gate recurrent unit (GRU) with the inputs of weather and pollutant parameters. Missing data were calculated by Gaussian diffusion estimated value and the error predicted by GRU. The established GD-GRU model was applied to repair the long-sequence missing data. The analytical results indicated that the GD-GRU model had higher prediction accuracy of extreme values than Gaussian diffusion model and GRU model, because GD-GRU based on Gaussian diffusion can calculate the extreme value by simulating the diffusion and transmission mechanism. The established model predicted PM2.5 concentration in the next hours with an RMSE of 12.561, which was approximately 21.02% better, on average, than methods like autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory model (LSTM), and GRU. The established GD-GRU model demonstrated good performance on extreme values prediction and air quality data repair, thus providing a new method for air quality long-sequence missing data repair.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2022-06-10 02:09:41","2022-07-30 22:21:44","","","","","308","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127446","Long short-term memory; Repair; Deep learning; Errors; Air quality; Mean square error; Gaussian distribution; Diffusion; Data repair; PM2.5; PM; Gaussian diffusion; PREDICTION; MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; OZONE; POLLUTANTS; POLLUTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; TRANSFORMATION; TRANSPORT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part of the data preparation, standardization, and cleaning processes, such as data matching and deduplication for instance, could be automated by making a ML model 'learn' and predict the matches routinely. Data integration can also benefit from ML as the data to be integrated can be sampled and used to design the data integration algorithms. After the initial manual work to setup the labels, ML models can start learning from the new incoming data that are being submitted for standardization, integration, and cleaning. The more data supplied to the model, the better the ML algorithm can perform and deliver accurate results. Therefore, ML is more scalable compared to traditional and time-consuming approaches. Nevertheless, many ML algorithms require an out-of-The-box tuning and their parameters and scope are often not adapted to the problem at hand. To make an example, in cleaning and integration processes, the window sizes of values used for the ML models cannot be arbitrarily chosen and require an adaptation of the learning parameters.

To facilitate accurate classification in the presence of noisy labels, we propose a novel hybrid method based on active learning and data cleaning. Specifically, we first train an initial classifier with noisily- labeled data. Based on its prediction outcomes, a set of most informative samples is queried for manual annotation. To effectively correct other incorrect labels, we further self-label the unqueried samples based on the true labels provided by human experts and the estimated labels predicted by the initial classifier.

This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture morphological information in their representation. Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: Scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: A Gamma-Poisson matrix factorizationon substring counts, and a min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: If scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.  2020 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:18","2022-07-31 03:06:00","","1164-1176","","3","34","","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2020.2992529","Cleaning; Machine learning; Factorization; Semantics; Signal encoding; Encoding (symbols); Data models; Encoding; Statistical analysis; autoML; Gamma-Poisson factorization; interpretable machine learning; large-scale data; min-hash; Natural language processing; Statistical learning; string categorical variables; ALGORITHMS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning attacks in which noise is added to the input to change the networks' output. Consequently, DNN-based mission-critical applications such as those used in self-driving vehicles have reduced reliability and could cause severe accidents and damage. Moreover, adversarial examples could be used to poison DNN training data, resulting in corruptions of trained models. Besides the need for detecting adversarial examples, correcting them is important for restoring data and system functionality to normal. We have developed methods for detecting and correcting adversarial images that use multiple image processing operations with multiple parameter values. For detection, we devised a statistical-based method that outperforms the feature squeezing method. For correction, we devised a method that uses for the first time two levels of correction. The first level is label correction, with the focus on restoring the adversarial images' original predicted labels (for use in the current task). The second level is image correction, with the focus on both the correctness and quality of the corrected images (for use in the current and other tasks). Our experiments demonstrated that the correction method could correct nearly 90% of the adversarial images created by classical adversarial attacks and affected only about 2% of the normal images.

Unfortunately, this often results in unsus-tainable cloud-based solutions, whereby, in the interest of simplicity, a wealth of raw (unprocessed) data are pushed from sensor nodes to the cloud. Herein, we advocate the use of machine learning at sensor nodes to perform essential data-cleaning operations, to avoid the transmission of corrupted (often unusable) data to the cloud. Starting from a public pollution dataset, we investigate how two machine learning techniques (kNN and missForest) may be embedded on Raspberry Pi to perform data imputation, without impacting the data collection process. Our experimental results demon-strate the accuracy and computational efficiency of edge-learning methods for filling in missing data values in corrupted data series. We find that kNN and missForest correctly impute up to 40% of randomly distributed missing values, with a density distribution of values that is indistinguishable from the benchmark.

One of the most important steps in the process is to compare generated substantial amounts of ML models to find the optimal one for the deployment. It is challenging to compare such models with dynamic number of features. This paper proposes a novel visualisation approach based on a radial net to compare ML models trained with a different number of features of a given data set while revealing implicit dependent relations. In the proposed approach, ML models and features are represented by lines and arcs respectively. The dependence of ML models with dynamic number of features is encoded into the structure of visualisation, where ML models and their dependent features are directly revealed from related line connections. ML model performance information is encoded with colour and line width in the innovative visualisation. Together with the structure of visualization, feature importance can be directly discerned to help to understand ML models.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:18","2022-07-31 15:41:47","","226-230","","","2020-June","","","","IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1028","Machine learning; Feature extraction; Data visualization; Intelligent systems; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Visualization; Heuristic algorithms; Training; Machine learning algorithms; Image color analysis; performance; comparison; visualisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automatic and accurate tongue color classification is an important content of the objectification of tongue diagnosis. Due to the vagueness of the visual boundaries between different types of tongue colors and the subjectivity of the doctors, the annotated tongue image data samples often contain noises, which has a negative effect on the training of the tongue color classification model. Therefore, in this paper, a tongue color classification method in TCM with noisy labels is proposed. Firstly, a two-stage data cleaning method is proposed to identify and clean noisy labeled samples. Secondly, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the channel attention mechanism is designed in this paper to achieve accurate classification of tongue color by enhancing the expressiveness of features. Finally, a knowledge distillation strategy with a noise sample filtering mechanism is proposed. This strategy adds a noise sample filtering mechanism led by the teacher network to eliminate further noise samples. At the same time, the teacher network is used to guide the training of the light convolutional neural network to improve the classification performance.The experimental results on the self-established TCM tongue color classification dataset show that the proposed method in this paper can significantly improve the classification accuracy with lower computational complexity, reaching 93.88%.  2022, Science Press.

As a result of that situation, advanced pre-processing and analysis of collected data became a crucial topic for extracting meaningful patterns hidden in the data. Therefore, traditional machine learning algorithms generally fail to gather satisfactory results when analyzing complex data. The main reason of this situation is the difficulty of capturing multiple characteristics of the high dimensional data. Within this scope, ensemble learning enables the integration of diversified single models to produce weak predictive results. The final combination is generally achieved by various voting schemes. On the other hand, if a large amount of single models are utilized, voting mechanism cannot be able to combine these results. At this point, Deep Learning (DL) provides the combination of the ensemble results in a considerable time. Apart from previous studies, we determine various predictive models in order to forecast the outcome of two different case studies. Consequently, data cleaning and feature selection are conducted in advance and three predictive models are defined to be combined. DL based integration is applied substituted for voting mechanism. The weak predictive results are fused based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) using different parameters and datasets and best predictors are extracted. After that, different experimental combinations are evaluated for gathering better prediction results. For comparison, grouped individual results (clusters) with proper parameters are compared with DL based ensemble results.  2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Active learning is one way to address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection latencies by up to 10 without affecting the quality of the model.

One of the perennial challenges in data analytics is the detection and handling of non-valid data. Failing to do so can result in creating imbalanced observations that can cause bias and influence estimates, and in extreme cases, can even lead to inaccurate analytics and unreliable decisions. Usually, the process of data cleaning is time-consuming due to its growing volume, velocity, and variety. Further, the complexity and difficulty of the cleaning process increase with the amount of data to be analyzed. It is rarely the case that any real-world data is clean and error-free. Thus, pre-processing the data before using it for analysis has become standard practice. This paper is intended to provide an easy-to-use and reliable system which automates the cleaning process for univariate time series data. Also, automating the process reduces the time required for cleaning it. Another issue that the proposed system aims to solve is making the visualization of a large amount of data more effective. To tackle these issues, an R package, cleanTS is proposed. The proposed system provides a way to analyze data on different scales and resolutions.

The development of Internet-of-Things has spawned novel ways for heart monitoring but also presented new challenges for manual arrhythmia detection. An automated method is highly demanded to provide support for physicians. Current attempts for automatic arrhythmia detection can roughly be divided as feature-engineering based and deep-learning based methods. Most of the feature-engineering based methods are suffering from adopting single classifier and use fixed features for classifying all five types of heartbeats. This introduces difficulties in identification of the problematic heartbeats and limits the overall classification performance. The deep-learning based methods are usually not evaluated in a realistic manner and report overoptimistic results which may hide potential limitations of the models. Moreover, the lack of consideration of frequency patterns and the heart rhythms can also limit the model performance. To fill in the gaps, we propose a framework for arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs. The framework consists of two modules: a data cleaning module and a heartbeat classification module. Specifically, we propose two solutions for the heartbeat classification task, namely Dynamic Heartbeat Classification with Adjusted Features (DHCAF) and Multi-channel Heartbeat Convolution Neural Network (MCHCNN). DHCAF is a feature-engineering based approach, in which we introduce dynamic ensemble selection (DES) technique and develop a result regulator to improve classification performance. MCHCNN is deep-learning based solution that performs multi-channel convolutions to capture both temporal and frequency patterns from heartbeat to assist the classification. We evaluate the proposed framework with DHCAF and with MCHCNN on the well-known MIT-BIH-AR database, respectively. The results reported in this paper have proven the effectiveness of our framework.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:20","2022-07-30 22:28:58","","2835-2850","","5","23","","World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-019-00776-9","Deep learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Feature extraction; Internet of things; Diseases; Heart; Convolution; Patient monitoring; ECG; Internet-of-Things; ECG, Dynamic ensemble selection, Deep learning, Cardiac arrhythmia detection, Internet-of-Things, ResNet; MODEL; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; Cardiac arrhythmia detection; COMPETENCE; DYNAMIC CLASSIFIER SELECTION; Dynamic ensemble selection; FEATURES; HEARTBEAT CLASSIFICATION; MIXTURE; ResNet; WAVELET TRANSFORM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is fueled by two key factors. First, data have become increasingly abundant and are often available openly. Enterprises have more data than they can process. Governments are spearheading open data initiatives by setting up data portals such as data.gov and releasing large amounts of data to the public. Second, AI engineering development is becoming increasingly democratized. Open source frameworks have enabled even an individual developer to engineer sophisticated AI systems. But with such ease of use comes the potential for irresponsible use of data.Ensuring that AI systems adhere to a set of ethical principles is one of the major problems of our age. We believe that data and model transparency has a key role to play in mitigating the deleterious effects of AI systems.

Specifically, we advocate an approach based on automated annotations (of both data and the AI model), which has a number of appealing properties. The annotations could be used by enterprises to get visibility of potential issues, prepare data transparency reports, create and ensure policy compliance, and evaluate the readiness of data for diverse downstream AI applications.

This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards.

GPS data are typically collected by smartphones apps, which are restricted to small samples of the population. Cellular signaling data (CSD) are usually collected by mobile network operators, which enables researchers to conduct travel behavior analysis of the entire population at a relatively low cost compared to GPS. However, extracting travel mode information from CSD is particularly challenging due to the noise data and low positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a travel mode identification framework based on CSD, which includes data cleansing and travel mode identification. In terms of data cleansing, oscillation sequence and drift data are mainly cleansed. For the oscillation sequence, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on time window. For the drift data, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on distance, velocity and frequency. In terms of travel mode identification, the task is divided into two dichotomous problems: motor and non-motor transport identification and public and private transport identification. Each dichotomous problem proposes an algorithm that does not rely on the ground truth dataset for model training. Finally, a ground truth dataset is constructed to verify all algorithms. The result shows that, in terms of data cleansing, the similarity between CSD after cleansing and the actual trajectory according to DTW improved by 101.13% on average. In terms of travel mode identification, the proposed method can achieve similar or even better accuracy than traditional supervised-learning algorithms (94% in motor and non-motor transport identification, 83.5% in public and private transport identification), which can be directly applied to large-scale population analysis scenarios.  2022 Jiatao Chen et al.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:22","2022-07-31 01:44:57","","","","","2022","","Mobile Information Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Hindawi Limited","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2113213","Global positioning system; Population statistics; Signal detection; CLASSIFICATION; PHONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, inconsistency and incomplete information are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, and their impact on ML applications remains elusive. In this paper, we present a formal study of this impact by extending the notion of Certain Answers for Codd tables, which has been explored by the database research community for decades, into the field of machine learning. Specifically, we focus on classification problems and propose the notion of ""Certain Predictions"" (CP) - a test data example can be certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of all possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same prediction. We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines whether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the number of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given that general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without assumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP queries can be developed - we show that it is possible to answer both queries in linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds. We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of ""data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML)."" We show that our proposed CPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of classification accuracy with mild manual cleaning effort.

In BNAS, the single-path sampling-updating strategy of an overparameterized BCNN leads to terrible unfair training issue, which restricts the efficiency improvement. To mitigate the unfair training issue, we employ a continuous relaxation strategy to optimize all paths of the overparameterized BCNN simultaneously. However, continuous relaxation leads to a performance collapse issue that leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned BCNN. For that, we propose the confident learning rate (CLR) and introduce the combination of partial channel connections and edge normalization. Experimental results show that 1) BNAS-v2 delivers state-of-the-art search efficiency on both CIFAR-10 (0.05 GPU days, which is 4x faster than BNAS) and ImageNet (0.19 GPU days) with better or competitive performance; 2) the above two solutions are effectively alleviating the performance collapse issue; and 3) BNAS-v2 achieves powerful generalization ability on multiple transfer tasks, e.g., MNIST, FashionMNIST, NORB, and SVHN.

Regarded as experts by senior management, estimators are among the most valued resources, and nonetheless, human. Over time, estimators learn from mistakes, and get better with tenure at sharpening assessments. When estimators retire without having groomed an apprentice, shipyards may be at risk of losing a lot of know-how, all at once. These shipyards may well find very costly to experience, for a while, estimating skills stepping back on the learning curve. Yet, even shipyards relying on less advanced information technology may have unwittingly accumulated a lot of valuable data relevant to ship maintenance and repair works. These shipyards may overlook how easily accessible knowledge can be turned into a competitive advantage through predictive analytics. Not only can this data be literally mined, but machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), can now process it for a speedy and preliminary estimate through faster and cheaper computing power. To be clear, the purpose is not to replace the human estimator but to help the expert quickly assess, when times are busy, whether to bid or not on a specific project opportunity. In the absence of The Master Estimator, an Apprentice may also look for a quick and cheap sanity check of the prepared estimate before submitting a bid. The study carried out in this article is based on all ship maintenance and repair data recorded at a single North American shipyard over the last 19 years since the current information systems were implemented. This raw data extract with all directly paid hours logged daily by workers on 1277 ship maintenance and repair projects was screened through advanced data cleansing. To enrich the cleansed data tables, additional independent variables were subsequently collected internally and externally to develop a trainingtesting data set. The final 657 projects represent 136 vessels regrouped in eight types, for which 28 other independent variables were all made available for training up to testing simple ANN models. The scope of this article is limited to the estimation of the direct labor required to complete ship maintenance and repair projects on a specific type of vessels for which workforce planning and tactical pricing was deemed the most relevant to keep the business afloat.  2022 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

However, such multi-source heterogenous data typically contain low-quality data, e.g., missing values, which may result in potential risks. Besides, resource-constrained devices incur large latency in edge computing networks. To alleviate such latency, distributed task offloading schemes are designed to share the computation burden between edge nodes and nearby servers. However, there are three main drawbacks of such schemes. First, low-quality data are not carefully evaluated by constraints under scenarios, which may result in slow convergence in distributed computation. Second, multi-source data including sensitive information are computed and shared among edge nodes without privacy protection. Third, distributed tasks on low-quality data may result in low-quality results even with an optimal offloading scheme. To address the problems above, a task offloading framework for edge computing based on consortium blockchain and distributed reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which can provide high-quality task offloading policies with data privacy protected. This framework consists of three key components: data quality evaluation (DQ) with multiple data quality dimensions, data repairing (DR) with a repairing algorithm based on a novel repairing consensus mechanism and distributed reinforcement learning for task arrangement (DELTA) with a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm based on a novel low-quality data distributing strategy. Numeric results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed task offloading framework for edge computing on low-quality data in the IoE.  1983-2012 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:24","2022-07-31 14:42:37","","657-676","","2","40","","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3118417","Repair; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Quality control; Blockchain; Edge computing; Data privacy; Task analysis; Data integrity; Blockchains; consortium blockchain; data quality; distributed learning; Internet of energy; Organizations; task offloading; ALLOCATION; IOT; RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION; THINGS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adopting deep learning techniques has the potential to lessen these challenges.

Specifically, we reduce the cost of training deep entity resolution models by performing unsupervised representation learning. This unveils a transferability property of the resulting model that can further reduce the cost of applying the approach to new datasets by means of transfer learning.

Due to an enormous amount of data growth in the biomedical and healthcare field the accurate analysis of medical data becomes propitious for earlier detection of disease and patient care. However, the accuracy decreases when the medical data is partially missing. To overcome the problem of missing medical data, we perform data cleaning and imputation to transform the incomplete data to complete data.

However, wireless enterprise networks are more vulnerable than wired networks because of the broadcast feature. Thus, illegal attacks such as data theft and information forgery seriously threaten the property and information security of users and enterprises; these phenomena are attracting increasing attention from both academia and industry. Additionally, effectively detecting the attacks in the wireless enterprise networks is one of todays most important and challenging problems, especially in Wi-Fi networks, as attacks become increasingly covert and diverse. Fortunately, WiFi networks produce large amounts of data, providing copious big data for researchers. In this paper, using the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID), which is derived from the real-world Wi-Fi network, we introduce machine learning to detect network attacks. To significantly increase the training and convergence speeds, we deploy two-dimensional data cleaning and select 18 useful attributes from the original set of 154.

The detection accuracy for flooding attacks, injection attacks, and normal data reached 89.18%, 87.34%, and 99.88% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a two-dimensional data cleaning method with an SVM to improve the detection accuracy for attacks.

In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model to address the short-term trajectory prediction problem in Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) by application of machine learning methods. The proposed model consists of two parts: clustering-based preprocessing and Multi-Cells Neural Network (MCNN)-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering and data re-sampling, we applied principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of trajectory vector variable. Then, the trajectories are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using nested cross validation, MCNN model is trained to find out the appropriate prediction model of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each individual cluster cell. Finally, the predicted ETA for each new flight is generated in different cluster cells classified by decision trees. To assess the performance of MCNN model, the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is proposed as the comparison learning model, and K-means++ and DBSCAN are proposed as two comparison clustering models in preprocessing part. With real 4D trajectory data in Beijing TMA, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model MCNN with DBSCAN in preprocessing is the most effective and robust hybrid machine learning model, both in trajectory clustering and short-term 4D trajectory prediction. In addition, it can make an accurate trajectory prediction in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with regards to comparison models.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","2018","2022-06-10 02:10:27","2022-07-30 22:34:19","","280-294","","","95","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.019","Machine learning; Learning systems; Neural networks; Decision trees; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Information management; Data mining; Air traffic control; Mean square error; Linear regression; Air transportation; Cells; Cytology; K-means clustering; Time of arrival; Trajectories; Clustering; 4D trajectory prediction; Air traffic management; Multi-cells neural network; TRAJECTORY PREDICTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: ASL MRI were acquired with 6 PLDs on a 1.5T or 3T GE system in adults with and without cognitive impairment (N=99). Voxel-level CBF and ATT maps were quantified by training models with distinct convolutional neural network architectures: (1) convolutional neural network (CNN) and (2) U-Net. Models were trained and compared via 5-fold cross validation. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE). Model outputs were trained on and compared against a reference ASL model fitting after data cleaning. Minimally processed ASL data served as another benchmark. Model output uncertainty was estimated using Monte Carlo dropout. The better-performing neural network was subsequently re-trained on inputs with missing PLDs to investigate generalizability to different PLD schedules. Results: Relative to the CNN, the U-Net yielded lower MAE on training data. On test data, the U-Net MAE was 8.4  1.4mL/100 g/min for CBF and 0.22  0.09 s for ATT. A significant association was observed between MAE and Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimates. Neural network performance remained stable despite systematically reducing the number of input images (i.e., up to 3 missing PLD images). Mean processing time was 10.77 s for the U-Net neural network compared to 10min 41 s for the reference pipeline.

Firstly, text is obtained through microblog crawler program. After data preprocessing, including data cleaning, Chinese word segmentation, removal of stop words, and so on, the Skip-gram model is used for word vector training on a large-scale unmarked corpus, and then the trained word vector is used as the text input of CNN-BiLSTM model, which combines Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Considering the historical context information and the subsequent context information, BiLSTM can better use the temporal relationship of text to learn sentence semantics. CNN can extract hidden features from the text and combine them. Finally, after Adamax optimization training, the emotion type of microblog comment text is output. The proposed model combines the learning advantages of BiLSTM and CNN.

Two widely used algorithms are the kernel principal component analysis and the one-class support vector machine. We find corresponding quantum algorithms to detect anomalies in quantum states. We show that these two quantum algorithms can be performed using resources that are logarithmic in the dimensionality of quantum states.

Researchers using machine learning often apply some data cleaning techniques to clean up corrupted data. There are two popular methods to clean corrupted data: one is to set manual cleaning rules, and the other is to use positive samples for machine learning or statistical methods. Our work proposes a data cleaning method based on ACGAN since it is difficult to manually formulate cleaning rules, and there are often no positive samples of training data too. Our work does not need to artificially add cleaning rules or positive samples, and subtly uses mode dropping of GAN to eliminate the impact of noisy labels on corrupted data so which can be converted to relatively clean synthetic training data. Mode dropping of ACGAN will naturally happens, which is originally a disadvantage that usually needs to be eliminated in GAN, we tom the disadvantage into advantage, ACGAN will ignore some non-subject features when generating data, so as to eliminate the impact of noisy labels.

Noise parameters are used to vary the total level of class noise and the proportion of class noise between the majority and minority classes. This allows us to better understand how class noise affects imbalanced data sets and where data cleaning efforts should be focused. Four popular machine learning algorithms are evaluated using six rounds of five-fold cross-validation to determine which learners are most robust to class noise. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) results shows that negative class noise, i.e. when positive instances are incorrectly labeled as negative, has the greatest adverse effect on classification performance. Statistical results show that the XGBoost learner performs significantly better than Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression Learners. True positive rates and true negative rates show that there is a trade-off that occurs as the noise proportion switches between the majority and negative classes. Finally, we show that the effects of class label noise can be combatted by regularizing the XGBoost learner through shallower decision trees.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:30","2022-07-31 04:02:19","","1427-1433","","","2021-November","","","","Proceedings - International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI52525.2021.00227","Big data; Machine learning; Decision trees; Logistic regression; Random forests; Crime; Economic and social effects; Health insurance; Big Data; Noise measurement; Machine learning algorithms; Conferences; Multilayer perceptrons; Robustness; Class Imbalance; Class Noise; Fraud Detection; Medicare; Robust Learners; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; FRAUD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven method. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some limitations in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale benchmark on object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. We collected remote sensing images with a resolution of 0.3m to 0.8m from different platforms, which are spread across many countries and regions. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 sub-categories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the quantity of instances and the quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution, (4) it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel evaluation method and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a visual classification task using several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep learning based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results strongly indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is considerably more challenging than existing datasets. Researchers can better investigate fine-grained object detection algorithms with the help of the FAIR1M dataset. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

The correct positioning of the implants is strongly related to multiple surgical variables that have a tremendous impact on the success of the surgery. Computer-based navigation systems have been investigated and developed in order to assist the surgeon in accurately controlling those surgical variables. The existing technologies are very costly, require additional bone incisions for fixing markers to be tracked, and these markers are usually bulky, interfering with the standard surgical flow. This work presents a markerless navigation system that supports the surgeon in accurately performing the TKA procedure. The proposed system uses a mobile RGB-D camera for replacing the existing optical tracking systems and does not require markers to be tracked. We combine an effective deep learning-based approach for accurately segmenting the bone surface with a robust geometry-based algorithm for registering the bones with pre-operative models. The favourable performance of our pipeline is achieved by (1) employing a semi-supervised labelling approach for generating training data from real TKA surgery data, (2) using effective data augmentation techniques for improving the generalisation capability and (3) using appropriate depth data cleaning strategies. The construction of this complete markerless registration prototype that generalises for unseen intra-operative data is non-obvious, and relevant insights and future research directions can be derived.

The typical practice is to create 'clean' data for analysis, matching entities and merging variants to overcome differences in knowledge representation. Despite progress in data management techniques to automate this process, it still needs labor-intensive supervision from the analyst. In this paper, we evaluate the benefit of advanced statistical tools to address directly many analytic tasks across data sources without such entity-matching cleaning. Reframing analytical questions as machine-learning tasks enables to replace exact matching of entities by continuous descriptions-vectorial embeddings- that expose similarities between entries. But are analyses with less cleaning trustworthy? We answer this question with a thorough benchmark on questions typical of socio-economic studies across 14 employee databases: we compare the approaches based on machine learning to manual data cleaning (entity matching). It reveals that using embeddings and machine learning improves results validity (smaller estimation error) more than manual cleaning, with considerably less human labor. While machine learning is often combined with data management for the purpose of cleaning, our study suggests that using it directly for analysis is beneficial because it captures ambiguities hard to represent during curation.  2013 IEEE.","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:31","2022-07-31 03:31:02","","42420-42431","","","10","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168013","Cleaning; Machine learning; Data integration; Embeddings; Information analysis; Job analysis; Statistical mechanics; data integration; data cleaning; Sociology; Task analysis; Manuals; Data analysis; embeddings; entity-matching; Remuneration; Soft sensors; DATA INTEGRATION; DETERMINANTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, odometer is inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices and smartphones. To apply forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Dedicated experiments have been conducted to verify the generalization capability and the precision of the OdoNet. The results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet, while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Hence, a data-cleaning procedure is adopted to effectively mitigate the impacts of the IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the processing mode using only non-holonomic constraint (NHC), by employing the pseudo-odometer, the positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74% for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation.

Therefore, probabilistic (weak) labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called Chef (CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than one big batch of samples. This yields better overall model performance and enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

The fundamental idea is to treat the data points with label noise as outliers of the class indicated by the corresponding noisy label. This essentially allows us to deal with the traditional supervised problem of classification with label noise as an unsupervised one, i.e., identifying outliers from each class. However, finding such dubious observations (outliers) from each class is challenging in general. We therefore propose to reduce their potential influence using class-specific feature learning by autoencoder. Particularly, we learn for each class a feature space using all the samples labeled as that class, including those with noisy (but unknown to us) labels. Furthermore, in order to solve the situation when the noise is relatively high, we propose a weighted class-specific autoencoder by considering the effect of each data point on the postulated model. To fully exploit the advantage of the learned class-specific feature space, we use a minimum reconstruction error based method for finding out the outliers (label noise) and solving the classification task. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance on the task of data cleaning and classification with noisy labels.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:34","2022-07-31 04:31:42","","1845-1860","","2","50","","Neural Processing Letters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-018-9963-9","Cleaning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Statistics; Data cleaning; Classification; Outliers; Data cleaning, Outliers, Classification, Class-specific autoencoder, Label noise; Label noise; Class-specific autoencoder; MISCLASSIFICATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the total amount of environmental protection investment in China shows a growing trend, the actual environmental protection investment still has a large gap compared with the increasing capital demand for environmental protection work. Financial resources play a key role in resource allocation. As long as funds are gradually withdrawn from polluting industries, they will be more invested in green and environmental industries, and resources such as land and labor will be optimally allocated. Faced with the complex international and domestic economic environment and increasing environmental pressures, this article proposes the green intelligent financial system construction paradigm based on deep learning and concurrency models.

Next, two data sets have been established, containing 575 facial motor nerve conduction study reports and 233 auditory brainstem response reports, respectively. And then, four machine learning algorithms including random forest, linear regression, support vector machine and logistic regression have been employed to the data sets. The performance comparisons of accuracy and recall rate among different algorithms indicate that the random forest algorithm has the optimal performance over the other two in both data sets. Moreover, the comparisons have been carried out in the cases with and without deviation standardization for each algorithm, and the results demonstrate that the deviation standardization has a certain effect on the accuracy improvement. Additionally, it is found that the random forest algorithm can present the ranking of the features in order of importance. Consequently, the random forest is proven to be an optimal algorithm for computer-aided diagnosis systems.

However, many patients with malignant tumors still have recurrence and metastasis after effective treatment. Exploring the mechanism of tumor recurrence and metastasis to predict the recurrence and metastasis of cancer is a major clinical issue. At the same time, the rapid development of the Human Genome Project and gene microarray technology has enabled the activity of many genes in the patient's body to be intuitively measured through the chip. The rapid development of machine learning has contributed to the data mining and medical science of this DNA microarray technology. Therefore, this project aims at the above-mentioned problems and predicts the location and time of recurrence by analyzing a large amount of clinical data and 2enetic data. Firstly, we perform simple data cleaning and normalization processing on clinical data and genetic data; second, perform differential gene screening; next, select principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, nuclear principal component analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling algorithms to reduce the dimensional of the data. Finally, the genetic data uses random forest, support vector machine, linear support vector machine, guided aggregation algorithm, gradient boosting algorithm, and ensemble learning for machine learning, and then finds the best parameters and methods through grid search, and selects the appropriate model Evaluation method. The clinical data is manually selected and classified using machine learning. Finally, the results of clinical data and genetic data are combined to predict the site of recurrence. Using the above method to predict the recurrence and the location of the recurrence, a good effect was achieved. Taking whether to recurrence as an example, the accuracy rate of the verification set reached 0.825, the recall rate reached 0.801, the Fl score reached 0.800.

In traditional approaches, the local GHI can be measured with very expensive instruments, and the large-area GHI collection depends on complex satellite-based models, solargis algorithms, and the high-performance computers (HPC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to capture the GHI conveniently and accurately. Considering the nonstationary property of the GHI on cloudy days, the GHI capturing is cast as an image regression problem. In traditional approaches, the image regression problem is treated as two parts, feature extraction (for the images) and regression model (for the regression targets), which are optimized separately and blocked the interconnections. Considering the nonlinear regression capability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image regression approach is proposed to provide an End-to-End solution for the cloudy day GHI capturing problem in this paper. The multilayer CNN is based on the AlexNet and VGG. The L2 (least square errors) with regularization is used as the loss function in the regression layer. For data cleaning, the Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference is employed to detect and eliminate the anomaly data in a nonparametric manner. The purified data are used as input data for the proposed image regression approach. In the experiments, three-month sky images and GHI data (with 1-min resolution) are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the HPC system. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.  2013 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:35","2022-07-31 15:00:51","","22235-22248","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2969549","Cleaning; Deep learning; Inference engines; Regression analysis; Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Bayesian networks; Gaussian distribution; Bayes methods; Solar radiation; deep learning; Computational modeling; Atmospheric modeling; Image processing; Bayesian theory; Clouds; Convolutional neural network; Dirichlet process; global horizontal irradiance; image regression; Radiation effects; sky image; solar irradiation; variational inference; ENERGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DNNs often require a large amount of data movement, resulting in performance and energy overheads. One promising way to address this problem is to design an accelerator based on in-situ analog computing that leverages the fundamental electrical properties of memristive circuits to perform matrix-vector multiplication. Recent work on analog neural network accelerators has shown great potential in improving both the system performance and the energy efficiency. However, detecting and correcting the errors that occur during in-memory analog computation remains largely unexplored. The same electrical properties that provide the performance and energy improvements make these systems especially susceptible to errors, which can severely hurt the accuracy of the neural network accelerators. This paper examines a new error correction scheme for analog neural network accelerators based on arithmetic codes. The proposed scheme encodes the data through multiplication by an integer, which preserves addition operations through the distributive property. Error detection and correction are performed through a modulus operation and a correction table lookup. This basic scheme is further improved by data-aware encoding to exploit the state dependence of the errors, and by knowledge of how critical each portion of the computation is to overall system accuracy. By leveraging the observation that a physical row that contains fewer 1s is less susceptible to an error, the proposed scheme increases the effective error correction capability with less than 4.5% area and less than 4.7% energy overheads. When applied to a memristive DNN accelerator performing inference on the MNIST and ILSVRC-2012 datasets, the proposed technique reduces the respective misclassification rates by 1.5x and 1.1x.  2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-06-10 02:10:35","2022-07-31 05:23:56","","52-65","","","2018-February","","","","Proceedings - International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2018.00015","Neural networks; Memory architecture; Deep neural networks; Error correction; Network architecture; Energy efficiency; Encoding (symbols); Acceleration; Analog computers; Computer architecture; Supercomputers; Table lookup; Accelerator architectures; Arrays; Computational modeling; Electric potential; Programming; Resistance; Thermal noise; CODES; NOISE; THERMAL AGITATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using traditional machine learning algorithms in the modeling of power station boilers will require features selection and steady-state extraction, which is not suitable for practical applications. In order to reduce the NOx prediction error rate under variable operating conditions, a multi-model fusion algorithm S3LX combined with linear regression, XGBoost, and long-short-Term memory recurrent neural network is proposed to model the NOx emission prediction of power station boilers. The preprocessing data scheme suitable for power station boiler data sets is proposed and implemented in this paper, which can perform numerical processing, data cleaning and data standardization for boiler's data and features. A 7-day historical operating data set of a unit in Guangzhou Shajiao C Power Plant was used as the training set and test set and was used to build the NOx emission prediction model after data preprocessing. Results show that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, S3LX has good prediction ability under varying conditions with an average error of 4.28%.

As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learningbased data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.

At the same time, environment conditions such as weather, traffic on the road, load in the vehicle, type of road, health condition of driver, and speed can also be the reasons for accidents. Hidden patterns in accidents can be extracted so as to find the common features between accidents. This paper presents the results of the framework from the research study on road accident data of major national highways that pass through Krishna district for the year 2013 by applying machine learning techniques into analysis. These datasets collected from police stations are heterogeneous. Incomplete and erroneous values are corrected using data cleaning measures, and relevance attributes are identified using attribute selection measures. Clusters that are formed using K-medoids, and expectation maximization algorithms are then analyzed to discover hidden patterns using a priori algorithm. Results showed that the selected machine learning techniques are able to extract hidden patterns from the data. Density histograms are used for accident data visualization.

Moreover, structured patient records often fail to effectively capture the nuances of patient-specific observations noted in doctors unstructured clinical notes and diagnostic reports. Automated techniques that utilize such unstructured text reports for modeling useful clinical information for supporting predictive analytics applications can thus be highly beneficial.

Word2Vec word embedding models were adopted for vectorizing and modeling textual features extracted from the patients reports. An unsupervised data cleansing technique for identification and removal of anomalous data/special cases was designed for optimizing the patient data representation. Further, a neural network model based on Extreme Learning Machine architecture was proposed for mortality prediction.

An accurate prediction of future demand is the need for a competitive and challenging market. Thus a robust and accurate model is required to cater to such needs. This paper proposes two novel approaches for taxi demand prediction that is about to come in the next ten-minutes interval. The first model is a three-stage ensemble model for prediction where the first stage consists of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and then Mini-Batch K-Means clustering is applied, followed by time-binning in the second stage and in the final stage the processed data is fed to the Ensemble Model. The second model is a four-stage deep learning model where the first two stages are common as the proposed ensemble model. In the third stage, the Fourier Transform of the time series data is used to extract and add more features to the training set and in the final stage, the processed training set is fed to the deep neural network (DNN) for prediction. The NYC TLC trip dataset is used for the experiments, and the results clearly indicate that the proposed models perform better than the existing models and the deep learning model performs the best among all.  2020 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:38","2022-07-31 15:41:14","","574-582","","","","","","","2020 IEEE 7th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Applications, ICIEA 2020","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Bangkok, Thailand","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA49774.2020.9102115","Deep learning; Machine learning; Learning systems; Neural networks; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Deep neural networks; K-means clustering; Fourier series; Taxicabs; clustering; deep learning; Analytical models; Computational modeling; Data models; Predictive models; deep neural network (DNN); ensemble model; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA); fourier transform; Public transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Globally, a significant amount of energy is consumed in residential buildings, i.e., 30-40% of total energy consumption. An active energy prediction system is highly desirable for efficient energy production and utilization. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to predict short-term energy consumption in a residential building. The proposed methodology consisted of four different layers, namely data acquisition, preprocessing, prediction, and performance evaluation. For experimental analysis, real data collected from 4 multi-storied buildings situated in Seoul, South Korea, has been used. The collected data is provided as input to the data acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer afterwards, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes are applied to the input data for the removal of abnormalities. Preprocessing further consisted of two processes, namely the computation of statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) and data normalization. In the prediction layer, the feed forward back propagation neural network has been used on normalized data and data with statistical moments. In the performance evaluation layer, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) have been used to measure the performance of the proposed approach. The average values for data with statistical moments of MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are 4.3266, 11.9617, and 5.4625 respectively. These values of the statistical measures for data with statistical moments are less as compared to simple data and normalized data which indicates that the performance of the feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBPNN) on data with statistical moments is better when compared to simple data and normalized data.","2019-06","2022-06-10 02:10:38","2022-07-30 22:29:06","","30 (16 pp.)","","2","7","","Technologies","","Technologies (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/technologies7020030","power engineering computing; statistical analysis; mean square error methods; data acquisition; energy consumption; backpropagation; buildings (structures); feedforward neural nets; artificial neural network; ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; energy consumption prediction; smart buildings; smart homes; statistical moments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based QoE prediction approach with a large-scale QoE dataset for mobile video transmission. Specifically, we develop a mobile phone application for collecting user QoE data when viewing videos transmitted over the mobile internet in a practical environment. Then, we construct a large-scale dataset by collecting over 80000 piece of data with four kinds of subjective scores and 89 network parameters. Each QoE metric is related to only some of the 89 network parameters. Therefore, we apply the feature selection method to find the feature parameters related to user scores. Additionally, the boxplot method is used to clean the raw data by removing outliers. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to learn the relationships between the network parameters and the subjective QoE scores. The proposed DNN can also be seen as a data-driven objective QoE prediction approach for mobile video transmission, which can be used to predict the user QoE scores. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively remove most features irrelevant to QoE prediction. Moreover, the performance of QoE prediction by the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.  1983-2012 IEEE.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:39","2022-07-31 05:41:25","","1337-1348","","6","37","","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904359","Monitoring; Deep learning; Neural networks; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Data acquisition; feature selection; User experience; Quality of service; data cleaning; deep learning; Databases; Streaming media; Quality assessment; Image communication systems; MODEL; data collection; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; Quality of experience; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; SERVICE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, traditional gas kick detection methods in such environments have significant time-lag and can often lead to severe well control issues, and occasionally to well blowouts or borehole abandonment. In this study, firstly, the raw field data is processed through data collection, data cleaning, feature scaling, outlier detection, data labeling and dataset splitting. Additionally, a novel data labeling criterion for gas kick risks is proposed where five kick risks (Indicated by different colors in this study) are defined based on three key indicators: differential flow out (DFO), kick gain volume (Vol), and kick duration time (Time). Kick risk status represents one of the following cases: Case 0 - No indicators are activated (Green), Case 1 - Multi-drilling parameters deviation or DFO is activated (Orange), Case 2 - DFO and Vol are simultaneously activated (Light Red), Case 3 - DFO and Time are simultaneously activated (Light Red), Case 4 - DFO, Vol and Time alarms are simultaneously activated (Dark Red). Then, a novel data mining method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is presented for early detection of gas kick events by analyzing time series data from field drilling process. The network parameters such as number of hidden layers and number of neurons are initialized to build the LSTM network. The learned LSTM model is evaluated using the testing set, and the best LSTM model (six (6)-layers eighty (80)-nodes (6 L*80 N)) is optimally selected and deployed. The accuracy of deployed LSTM model is 87 % in the testing dataset, which is reliable enough to identify the kick fault during the deep-water drilling field operation. Lastly, the LSTM model detected the gas kick events earlier than the ""Tank Volume"" detection method in several representative case studies to conclude that the application of LSTM model can potentially improve well control safety in the deep-water wells with narrow MW windows.  2020","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:40","2022-07-31 13:42:43","","312-328","","","146","","Process Safety and Environmental Protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institution of Chemical Engineers","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2020.08.012","Long short-term memory; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Statistical tests; Data mining; Data acquisition; Supervised learning; Risk assessment; Infill drilling; Gases; Deepwater drilling; Chemical detection; Offshore oil well production; Abandoned wells; Accident prevention; Offshore gas wells; Risk analysis; Water wells; Early gas; Field data analysis; Gas kick; Industrial deep-water drilling; Kick detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Training of the models was performed using image data available on the Internet, while database development included data cleansing by expert agronomists, basic image editing, and data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning applications in order to expand the rather limited amount of available data. Three fungi diseases, two pests and three nutrient deficiencies were included in the identification system, together with healthy plants identification. The final model reached a performance of 90.79% in successfully identifying cannabis diseases (or healthy plants) in previously ""unseen"" plant images. The most difficult cannabis problems to be identified were powdery mildew and potassium deficiency. Results showed that transfer learning from existing models specialized in similar tasks to the one under development, is more successful than using transfer learning from more general models. Finally, even though the amount of training images in some of the considered problems was significantly small, no correlation between model performance and the size of the training dataset for each category was found.

However, data cleansing is often a laborious task that requires intuition or expert knowledge. In particular, selecting an outlier detection algorithm is challenging as this choice is dataset-specific and depends on the nature of the considered dataset. These difficulties have prevented the development of a ""one-fits-all"" approach for the cleansing of real-world, noisy datasets. Here, we present an unsupervised, ensemble-based outlier detection (EBOD) approach that considers the union of different outlier detection algorithms, wherein each of the selected detectors is only responsible for identifying a small number of outliers that are the most obvious from their respective standpoints. The use of an ensemble of weak detectors reduces the risk of bias during outlier detection as compared to using a single detector. The optimal combination of detectors is determined by forwardbackward search. By taking the example of a noisy dataset of concrete strength measurements as well as a broad collection of benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our EBOD method systematically outperforms all alternative detectors, when used individually or in combination.

It is able to determine stress, fatigue, workload, health status and pilot capacity with new models based on DCNN encoded in Python which are able to interpret these vital data.Additionally, PMS is able to launch alerts when the vital parameters of the crew reach pre-established limits, giving the chance to detect an abnormal situation (e.g. excessive workload scenario with high stress level). In this way, it will improve situational awareness by making crew aware of their own conditionGoing deeper into the details of the Stress Model, its main objective is to determine Pilot stress in real time.For achieving this target, several design stages were taken into consideration while building the Stress Model DCNN: raw data acquisition, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training, model evaluation, model testing, and result analysis. Further details of these stages are explained below.Regarding data acquisition, Stress Model obtains pilot's vital data from a smartwatch (one of the wearable devices of PMS), which communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a laptop. Selected device was Analog Devices Inc. Gen II watch, which sends the following signals: Heart Rate (HR), Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA), Skin temperature and 3D Acceleration.At Cleaning stage, Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) was used to normalize our raw data, being less sensitive to outliers and therefore more robust.At Feature engineering stage, several signal combinations were explored. The selected signal set which gave the best Stress Model accuracy was comprised of two EDA parameters (Real Admittance [Siemens], Impedance Magnitude [Ohm]) and wrist Skin Temperature [deg C].At Algorithm selection stage, three convolutional layers (128, 256 and 128 filters respectively) were chosen to extract a feature map from the inputs. After them, a Global Average Pooling (GAP) was chosen to compress the convolutions output. Downstream GAP, a decision layer based on softmax activation function (stress vs non-stress) was chosen.At Training stage, it was necessary to implement a Stress Test recording campaign. Participants were asked to fulfill several individual demanding tasks (memory, multi-task, stroop, vigilance) which included relaxing periods among them. The Stress Model was fed with the vital data obtained in this campaign.In between the tasks, NASA-TLX questionnaires were filled by test subjects, to obtain their subjective rating of Mental demand, Physical demand, Temporal demand, Performance, Effort and Frustration. Therefore, the Stress Model considered both vital data and self-report questionnaires as inputs.At result analysis stage, the Stress Model accuracy was refined, understanding accuracy as the ratio between correct predicted stress scenarios versus total cases, and considering ground truth self-report questionnaires.Finally, Stress Model DCNN was validated considering three data sources, whose details are included below:A.Vital data from fifteen (N=15) subjects of Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) Database available online.Stress Model gave an average test accuracy of 99%,B.Vital data from four (N=4) Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) pilots while calibrating their NASA-TLX scale.Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 90%.C.Vital data from six (N=6) ADS pilots while performing simulator evaluations using an Enhanced Light Weight Visor (ELWEV).Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 87%.  2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 14:15:41","","AESS; AIAA; AIAA Digital Avionics Technical Committee (DATC); et al.; IEEE; Southwest Research Institute (SWRI)","","","2021-October","","","","AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","San Antonio, TX, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594363","Monitoring; Deep neural networks; Data acquisition; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; NASA; Wearable computers; Analytical models; Training; Data models; Predictive models; Atmospheric modeling; Temperature sensors; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Electro-Dermal Activity; NASA-TLX; Pilot Stress; wearable devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, it is difficult to provide accurate local wear predictions in a timely manner. Data-driven approaches provide a more computationally efficient way to approximate the CFD wear predictions without running the actual CFD wear models. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach, termed WearGP, is presented to approximate the 3D local wear predictions, using numerical wear predictions from steady-state CFD simulations as training and testing datasets. The proposed framework is built on Gaussian process (GP) and utilized to predict wear in a much shorter time. The WearGP framework can be segmented into three stages. At the first stage, the training dataset is built by using a number of CFD simulations in the order of O(102). At the second stage, the data cleansing and data mining processes are performed, where the nodal wear solutions are extracted from the solution database to build a training dataset. At the third stage, the wear predictions are made, using trained GP models. Two CFD case studies including 3D slurry pump impeller and casing are used to demonstrate the WearGP framework, in which 144 training and 40 testing data points are used to train and test the proposed method, respectively. The numerical accuracy, computational efficiency and effectiveness between the WearGP framework and CFD wear model for both slurry pump impellers and casings are compared. It is shown that the WearGP framework can achieve highly accurate results that are comparable with the CFD results, with a relatively small size training dataset, with a computational time reduction on the order of 105 to 106.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 03:36:59","","9-26","","","422-423","","Wear","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2018.12.081","Machine learning; Learning systems; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Data mining; Computational efficiency; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Computational fluid dynamics; Impellers; Pumps; Slurry pipelines; Wear of materials; Gaussian process; Multiphase computational fluid dynamics; Slurry pump; Wear; MODEL; PARTICLE EROSION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, silt (32128m) and sand (1281000m) sized grains will be characterized under an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope. In both cases, it is a tedious and costly process. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an original computational approach in order to automate mineral grains recognition from numerical images obtained with a simple optical microscope. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the current computer vision based on machine learning algorithms is tested for the automated recognition of such mineral grains. In more details, this work uses the simple linear iterative clustering segmentation to generate superpixels and many of them allow isolating sand grains, which is not possible with classical segmentation methods. Also, the approach has been tested using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs did not give as good results as the superpixels method. The superpixels are also exploited to extract features related to a sand grain. These image characteristics form the raw dataset. Prior to proceed with the classification, a data cleaning stage is necessary to get a usable dataset for machine learning algorithms. In addition, we present a comparison of performances of several algorithms. The overall obtained results are approximately 90% and demonstrate the concept of mineral recognition from a sample of sand grains provided by a numerical image.  2019 The Authors","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:41","2022-07-31 03:08:49","","84-93","","","130","","Computers and Geosciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2019.05.009","Machine learning; Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Iterative methods; Convolutional neural networks; Computer vision; Classification; Image segmentation; Image processing; Microscopes; Mineral exploration; Optical data processing; Ores; Sand; Scanning electron microscopy; Superpixels; Sand grain, Features, Machine learning, Recognition, Classification, Segmentation, Image processing, Ore; Features; Ore; Recognition; Sand grain; Segmentation; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is most prevalent in the supply chain optimization sector where vast amount of documents need to be processed and is time consuming and prone to error. Detection of tables and table structures serves as a crucial step to automate document processing. While table detection is a well investigated problem, tabular structure detection is more complex, and requires further improvements. To address this, this study proposes a deep learning model that focuses on high precision tabular cell structure detection. The proposed model creates a benchmark for the ICDAR2013 dataset cell structure with comparison to the previous state of the art table detection models as well as proposing alternative models. Our methodology approaches improving table structure detection through the detection of cells instead of row and columns for better generalization capabilities for heterogeneous table structures.

Although some models have been developed to predict linear or conformational B-cell epitopes, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Hundreds of thousands of linear B-cell epitope data have accumulated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). These data can be explored using the deep learning methods, in order to create better predictive models for linear B-cell epitopes. Results: After data cleaning, we obtained 240,563 peptide samples with experimental evidence from the IEDB database, including 25,884 linear B-cell epitopes and 214,679 non-epitopes. Based on the peptide center, we adapted each peptide to the same length by trimming or extending. A random portion of the data, with the same amount of epitopes and non-epitopes, were set aside as test dataset. Then a same number of epitopes and non-epitopes were randomly selected from the remaining data to build a classifier with the feedforward deep neural network. We built eleven classifiers to form an ensemble prediction model. The model will report a peptide as an epitope if it was classified as epitope by all eleven classifiers. Then we used the test data set to evaluate the performance of the model using the area value under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as an indicator. We established 40 models to predict linear B-cell epitopes of length from 11 to 50 separately, and found that the AUC value increased with the length and tended to be stable when the length was 38. Repeated results showed that the models constructed by this method were robust. Tested on our and two public test datasets, our models outperformed current major models available. Conclusions: We applied the feedforward deep neural network to the large amount of linear B-cell epitope data with experimental evidence in the IEDB database, and constructed ensemble prediction models with better performance than the current major models available.

Prediction of electrical loads and scheduling the generation resources to match the demand enable the utility to mitigate the energy generation cost. Different methodologies have been employed to predict energy consumption at different levels of distribution and transmission systems. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict energy consumption in smart buildings. The proposed framework consists of two stages, namely, data cleaning, and model building. The data cleaning phase applies pre-processing techniques to the raw data and adds additional features of lag values. In the model-building phase, the hybrid model is trained on the processed data. The hybrid deep learning (DL) model is based on the stacking of fully connected layers, and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) on bi-directional LSTMs. The proposed model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies of energy consumption on dependent features and to be effective in terms of computational complexity, training time, and forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark energy consumption datasets yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy when compared with widely used hybrid models such as Convolutional (Conv) Neural Network-LSTM, ConvLSTM, LSTM encoder-decoder model, stacking models, etc. A mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.00% for case study 1 and a MAPE of 3.71% for case study 2 is obtained for the proposed forecasting DL model in comparison with LSTM-based models that yielded 7.80% MAPE and 5.099% MAPE for two datasets respectively. The proposed model has also been applied for multi-step week-ahead daily forecasting with an improvement of 8.368% and 20.99% in MAPE against the LSTM-based model for the utilized energy consumption datasets respectively.  2013 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 03:02:53","","33498-33511","","","9","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061370","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Learning systems; Forecasting; Benchmarking; Smart power grids; Energy utilization; Electric power transmission; Electric loads; Energy conservation; Intelligent buildings; Model buildings; deep learning; Data models; Predictive models; Energy consumption; Load modeling; Appliances energy forecasting; bidirectional LSTM; hybrid model; Long short term memory; power forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, various artificial intelligence (AI) based methods are utilized to perform optimal energy forecasting, different simulation tools, and engineering methods to predict future demand based on historical data. Nevertheless, nonlinear energy demand modeling is still unfledged for a better solution to handle short-term and long-term dependencies and avoid static nature because it is purely on historical data-driven. In this paper, we propose an ensemble deep learning-based approach to predict and forecast energy demand and consumption by using chronological dependencies. Our system initially processes the data, cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the model performance. Furthermore, the preprocess data is fed to proposed ensemble model to extract hybrid discriminative features by using convolution neural network (CNN), stacked, and bi-directional long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. We trained our proposed system on the historical data to forecast the energy demand and consumption with a different time interval. In the proposed technique, we utilized the concept of active learning based on moving windows to ensure and improve the prediction performance of the system. The proposed system could be applicable to employ energy consumption in industrial and building sectors to demonstrate their significance and effectiveness.

This issue may seriously affect the data quality in some fields, such as transportation. A typical IoT application in transportation is electronic registration identification of the motor vehicle (ERI), an emerging traffic data acquisition technology based on RFID. ERI data play a vital role in intelligent transportation. However, the data quality is often affected seriously by the inaccurate timestamps, which arise from the time-unsynchronized distributed ERI readers. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, data repairing of time synchronization problems (DR-TSP), which can detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and correct timestamp-deviated ERI data. Precisely, DR-TSP consists of three components. Problem reader discovery component employs a statistics-based method to detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and discovers the clock leaps of the problematic ERI reader through a smoothing-based method. Travel-time estimation component constructs a spatial correlative travel-time estimation model based on the neural network to infer timestamp deviation. The influence of clock deviation is considered in the model training. Data correction component utilizes the above results to correct the timestamp-deviated data. Experiments over large-scale ERI data collected from a big China city, Chongqing, show that our method can significantly improve data quality.  2014 IEEE.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:42","2022-07-31 14:06:44","","11666-11677","","14","8","","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3058640","Technology transfer; Internet of things; Advanced traffic management systems; Data acquisition; Clocks; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Synchronization; Travel time; Internet of Things; Data models; Roads; Sensors; Data cleaning and repairing; radio-frequency identification (RFID); Radiofrequency identification; time synchronization problem; travel-time estimation model; OUTLIER DETECTION; THINGS; INTERNET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we present some recent results on brain lesion segmentation. While algorithms have been developed to automate the procec, the results often lack accuracy in tracing the lesions. Here, we present our results on the publically available ATLAS R1.1 dataset using deep CNN architectures. We utilize a deep U-net architecture with 3D convolutions, consisting of an encoder and a corresponding decoder along with dense residual connections between them, leveraging both low and high level features from the encoder at each step. We also analyze the use of Inception, Residual and Inception-Res blocks for the encoder. The architecture also makes use of an attention gate for the decoder part to supprec irrelevant parts of the incoming input while highlighting the salient features. The dataset had 239 3D MRI images of dimensions (197 x 233 x 189) with their corresponding segmentation maps. We used a train-validation-test split of 7:2:1, employing mean normalization, histogram equalization and suitable data augmentation techniques. We used SGD optimizer with focal Tversky loc function. The Dice score and AUC were used as metrics.

Nonetheless, the accuracy of these tools relies on the generation of large training sets of pre-labeled images. This is typically a challenging and cumbersome process, requiring extensive pre-processing to remove spurious samples that may lead the training to failure. Unlike their plain counterparts, which tend to provide overconfident decisions and cannot identify samples they have not been specifically trained for, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks provide a reliable measure of classification uncertainty. In this study, we exploit this inherent capability to automatize the data cleaning phase of histopathological image assessment.

However, these two logs are often missing or incomplete in many oil and gas wells. Therefore, many petrophysical and geophysical workflows include sonic log synthetization or pseudo-log generation based on multivariate regression or rock physics relations. Started on March 1,2020, and concluded on May 7, 2020, the SPWLA PDDA SIG hosted a contest aiming to predict the DTC and DTS logs from seven ""easy-to-acquire"" conventional logs using machine-learning methods (GitHub, 2020). In the contest, a total number of 20,525 data points with half-foot resolution from three wells was collected to train regression models using machine-learning techniques. Each data point had seven features, consisting of the conventional ""easy-to-acquire"" logs: caliper, neutron porosity, gamma ray (GR), deep resistivity, medium resistivity, photoelectric factor, and bulk density, respectively, as well as two sonic logs (DTC and DTS) as the target. The separate data set of 11,089 samples from a fourth well was then used as the blind test data set. The prediction performance of the model was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) as the metric, shown in the equation below: {equation presented}In the benchmark model, (Yu et al., 2020), we used a Random Forest regressor and conducted minimal preprocessing to the training data set; an RMSE score of 17.93 was achieved on the test data set.

To support growing planning and control decision-making, the need for large numbers of short-term load forecasts has emerged. Data-driven modelling of medium voltage feeders can be affected by (1) data quality issues, namely, large gross errors and missing observations (2) the presence of structural breaks in the data due to occasional network reconfiguration and load transfers. The present work investigates and reports on the effects of advanced data cleansing techniques on forecast accuracy. A hybrid framework to detect and remove outliers in large datasets is proposed; this automatic procedure combines the Tukey labelling rule and the binary segmentation algorithm to cleanse data more efficiently, it is fast and easy to implement. Various approaches for missing value imputation are investigated, including unconditional mean, Hot Deck via k-nearest neighbour and Kalman smoothing. A combination of the automatic detection/removal of outliers and the imputation methods mentioned above are implemented to cleanse time series of 342 medium-voltage feeders. A nested rolling-origin-validation technique is used to evaluate the feed-forward deep neural network models. The proposed data cleansing framework efficiently removes outliers from the data, and the accuracy of forecasts is improved. It is found that Hot Deck (k-NN) imputation performs best in balancing the bias-variance trade-off for short-term forecasting.  2019","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:43","2022-07-31 04:32:16","","","","","261","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114405","Anomaly detection; Forecasting; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Economic and social effects; Electric power plant loads; Feeding; Outlier detection; Binary segmentation; Distribution systems; Kalman smoothing; Multi-step forecasts; PERFORMANCE; TIME-SERIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current measures for image monitoring of icing overhead power lines rely on manual observation. There is an urgent need for image intelligent analysis methods with strong generalisation, accuracy, and efficiency to improve power grid decision-making. Based on the icing monitoring data from China Southern Power Grid, this paper first proposes rules for insulator image data cleaning, classification, and annotation, establishing a dataset of insulator icing monitoring images during 20142018. Then, based on Yolo (You only look once) v5, a weakly supervised and phased transfer learning method is proposed to recognise insulators and ice types such as snow, rime, mixed rime, glaze, and the normal. This method reduces the interference of icing background, uneven illumination, and camera occlusion through multidimensional feature fusion. The precision, recall, and mean average precision of the recognition can reach 86.6%, 91.3%, and 90.1%, respectively, and the recognition speed is as fast as 8ms/image. Using image pseudo-labelling based on weakly supervised learning enables the intellectualisation of image annotation, which significantly changes the inefficiency of manual labelling. 2022 The Authors.

With increasing complexity and volume of operations, rapid accumulation and analysis of this safety-related data has the potential to maintain and even lower the low global accident rates in aviation. This paper presents the development of an analytical methodology called Safety Analysis of Flight Events (SAFE) that synthesizes data cleaning, correlation analysis, classification-based supervised learning, and data visualization schema to streamline the isolation of critical parameters and the elimination of tangential factors for safety events in aviation. The SAFE methodology outlines a robust and repeatable framework that is applicable across heterogeneous data sets containing multiple aircraft, airport of operations, and phases of flight. It is demonstrated on Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data from a commercial airline through use cases related to three safety events, namely Tire Speed Event, Roll Event, and Landing Distance Event. The application of the SAFE methodology yields a ranked list of critical parameters in line with subject-matter expert conceptions of these events for all three use cases.

For a given dataset and data analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal result quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start with or which methods to use. Most current work can be classified into two categories: (1) they propose new data cleaning algorithms specific to certain types of data anomalies usually considered in isolation and without a ""pipeline vision"" of the entire data preprocessing strategy; (2) they develop automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of a considered ML model with a list of by-default preprocessing methods. We argue that more efforts should be devoted to proposing a principled and adaptive data preparation approach to help and learn from the user for selecting the optimal sequence of data preparation tasks to obtain the best quality performance of the final result. In this paper, we extend Learn2Clean, a method based on Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that selects, for a given dataset, a given ML model, and a preselected quality performance metric, the optimal sequence of tasks for preprocessing the data such that the quality metric is maximized.

The early detection of abnormal operation conditions can prevent failure status, which takes a long time to recover. Energy waste can also be reduced while maintenance efficiency can be improved by using a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor the operation status of wind turbines. Massive data are generated from different sensors during wind turbine operation, and SCADA can be used to gather reports about hundreds of possible abnormal conditions. The popular maintenance methods have been mostly designed on the basis of statistical analysis and data mining. However, such schemes need not only big data but also sophisticated processing techniques. This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing a deep learning model with comprehensive data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on batch size to achieve abnormal early detection. The necessary data preprocessing is initially conducted besides the conventional data cleaning and normalization steps, and time-series data windowing and label settings are also performed. Then, the imbalanced classes in the records are addressed by adopting an augmentation scheme called the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Principal component analysis is also used to enhance the training. Finally, the proposed deep learning method with fine-tuning is compared with three machine learning models for early anomaly event detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can identify potential faults 72 hours before they occur, and the precision rate exceeds 90 %.  2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:44","2022-07-31 04:42:17","","5323-5333","","12","35","","Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12206-021-1105-z","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Machine learning; Wind power; Wind turbines; Maintenance; Data mining; Data acquisition; Condition monitoring; Principal component analysis; Predictive maintenance; Electric power generation; Wind turbine; DIAGNOSIS; Data argumentation; FAULT-DETECTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised learning techniques. In this paper we propose original ideas that help us to leverage such datasets in the context of change detection. First, we propose the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level labels.

The repetitive nature of these workflows, and their hierarchical composition from building blocks exhibits high computational redundancy. Existing work addresses this redundancy with coarse-grained lineage tracing and reuse for ML pipelines. This approach allows using existing ML systems, but views entire algorithms as black boxes, and thus, fails to eliminate fine-grained redundancy and to handle internal non-determinism. In this paper, we introduce LIMA, a practical framework for efficient, fine-grained lineage tracing and reuse inside ML systems. Lineage tracing of individual operations creates new challenges and opportunities. We address the large size of lineage traces with multi-level lineage tracing and reuse, as well as lineage deduplication for loops and functions; exploit full and partial reuse opportunities across the program hierarchy; and integrate this framework with task parallelism and operator fusion.

However, most of existing AutoML pipelines only touch parts of the full machine learning pipeline, e.g., neural architecture search or optimizer selection. This leaves potentially important components such as data cleaning and model ensemble out of the optimization, and still results in considerable human involvement and suboptimal performance. The main challenges lie in the huge search space assembling all possibilities over all components, as well as the generalization ability over different tasks like image, text, and tabular etc. In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind fully AutoML pipeline, to comprehensively automate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model generation/selection/training and ensemble for an arbitrary dataset and evaluation metric.

The difficulty of generating high-quality datasets often constrains the improvement of research in such areas. To alleviate this issue, we propose a weakly supervised learning method for nuclei segmentation that only requires annotation of the nuclear centroid. To train the segmentation model with point annotations, we first generate boundary and superpixel-based masks as pseudo ground truth labels to train a segmentation network that is enhanced by a mask-guided attention auxiliary network. Then to further improve the accuracy of supervision, we apply Confident Learning to correct the pseudo labels at the pixel-level for a refined training.

However, we can show that using the appropriate active learning strategy, it is possible to outperform the more complex models that rely on data augmentation. To this end, we propose a multi-classifier approach with two-stage sampling for active learning. This intuitive and neat sampling method chooses the most promising cells across rows and columns for labeling. On three datasets, ED2 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while for large datasets, the required number of user labels is lower by one order of magnitude compared to the state of the art.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","2019","2022-06-10 02:10:45","2022-07-31 14:04:53","","2249-2252","","","","","","","International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Beijing, China","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3357384.3358129","Learning systems; Error detection; Large dataset; Supervised learning; Knowledge management; active learning, data quality, error detection, example-driven error detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Distinguished from the existing literatures of Polar codes that only consider the error detection capability of CRC, we attempt to take advantage of the inherent error correction capability of CRC and we first devise a segmented CRC-error-correcting aided SCL decoding (SCC-SCL) framework. Based on this framework, an error-correcting table based SCC-SCL (ET-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme is proposed, by introducing the look-up-table based CRC error correction method into the segmented Polar SCL decoding process. Since the error correction capability is limited by the size of the look-up table, which in turn limits the performance gain, we further propose a deep learning based SCC-SCL (DL-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme. In this scheme, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network replaces the error correction table to perform error correction, combining the sequence of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) with the syndromes to determine the error patterns. Simulation results show that both of the proposed decoding schemes have significant performance gain over the classic CRC error-detection aided SCL decoding scheme. Especially for the DL-SCC-SCL, the performance gain at bit error rate of 10-5 is about 0.5 dB.  2015 IEEE.","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:46","2022-07-31 13:49:29","","817-828","","2","6","","IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2946358","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Bit error rate; Error detection; Error correction; Decoding; Table lookup; error correction; Redundancy; Turbo codes; deep learning; Error correction codes; CRC; Cyclic redundancy check codes; Performance gain; Polar codes; successive cancellation list decoding; CODES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel data repairing approach based on a combination of constraints and ensemble learning. At first, functional dependencies (FDs) are used as constraints to identify inconsistent records. For each FD, all repeated values in the correct records are discovered. After that, noisy attributes in erroneous records are detected using correct records and the repeated values. To correct the detected noises, a supervised ensemble learning model is constructed for each attribute. The ensemble model consists of a Bayes classifier, a decision tree, and a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). A majority of votes is used as the combination strategy in the ensemble learning model. The proposed approach automatically repairs data without any user interaction. Moreover, the proposed method can detect more than one noise in a record. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms similar repairing algorithms (HoloClean and KATARA) in both terms of precision and recall.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2022-06-10 02:10:46","2022-07-30 22:48:26","","","","","159","","Expert Systems with Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113511","Learning systems; Decision trees; Data mining; Multilayer neural networks; Ensemble learning; Data repairing; Functional dependency; Noise detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These sensors/devices can sense multiple information related to the physical environment and the residents. This information is then transmitted to a central station for further processing through wireless communication. However, the wireless medium is considered vulnerable and the sensors can fail in providing correct measurements. Moreover, a smart home system should also be able to implement a cleaning system of its sensed data and discard those instances that are erroneous or incoherent. To achieve the data quality improvements, this paper proposes a new approach that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect faulty measurements. The proposed scheme can prematurely and efficiently detect outlier data before forwarding it to a central station.

The traditional kick-detection method mainly relies on the driller's analysis of monitored compound comprehensive mud-logging data. However, the traditional method has significant time lag, including missed and false detection, and often leads to severe gas influxes during deepwater drilling. A novel machine-learning (ML) model is presented here using pilot-scale rig data combined with surface-riser-downhole monitoring for gas-kick early detection and risk classification. A series of pilot-scale test-well experiments (a total of 108 tests) are performed to simulate deepwater gas kicks and produce a multisource data set through fusion of comprehensive mud-logging data from surface monitoring, acoustic data from riser-monitoring technologies, and measurement-while-drilling data [e.g., bottomhole pressure (BHP)] from downhole monitoring technologies. During these experiments, the deepwater blowout preventer (BOP) is simulated using a variable cross section of crossover (X/O; equipped with booster-flow pipes); the Coriolis flowmeter is installed in the mud-return pipe to accurately measure flow out; the acoustic wave sensors are installed outside of the riser section (X/O) to monitor gas migration; and the downhole memory pressure gauges are installed to monitor BHP. Next, data preparation and data analysis are performed including raw-data exploration, data cleaning, signal/noise-ratio (SNR) analysis, feature scaling, outlier detection, and feature engineering. Further, a novel and improved data-labeling criterion for gas-kick alarms is proposed, with six levels (displayed using different colors) instead of two-state alarms (""kick"" or ""no kick""). The proposed gas-kick-alarm classification is in accordance with the actual field practices. Subsequently, four ML algorithms-decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM)-are developed through the complete workflow, beginning with the data allocation and followed by building, evaluation, and optimization of each ML model. Because the LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm showed the best performance, it is selected and deployed to early detect gas kicks and classify the corresponding kick alarms. The recall for gas-kick levels corresponding to Risk 0, Risk 1, Risk 2, Risk 3, Risk 4, and Risk 5 are 0.92, 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, 0.92 and 0.92, respectively. Because recall for each gas-kick-alarm level is greater than 0.9, it ensures rare false negatives (FNs) during kick detection. The accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score of the deployed LSTM model in the testing data set is 91.6%, 0.93, 0.92 and 0.92, respectively. Further, the detection time delay is approximately 2 to 7 seconds only, which provides an improved time margin to take appropriate safety measures, promptly deal with a gas kick through a well-control program, and prevent a potential blowout during deepwater drilling.  2021 Society of Petroleum Engineers","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:48","2022-07-31 05:29:21","","1773-1799","","4","26","","SPE Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/205365-PA","Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Data handling; Learning systems; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Statistical tests; Nearest neighbor search; Acoustic logging; Infill drilling; Gases; Alarm systems; Blowouts; Bottom hole pressure; Deepwater drilling; Drilling machines (machine tools); Flowmeters; Logging while drilling; Mud logging; Oil field development; Petroleum prospecting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arthroscopy and Laparoscopy surgeries are considered Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS). In MIS, the surgeon operates through small incisions with specialized narrow instruments, fiberoptic lights, and a monitor. Arthroscopy surgery is used to diagnose and treat joints problems, and Laparoscopic procedures are performed on the abdominal cavity. Due to non-natural hand-eye coordination, narrow field-of-view, and limited instrument control, MIS training is challenging to master. We are analyzing two simulators' data, Virtual Arthroscopic Tear Diagnosis and Evaluation Platform (VATDEP) and Gentleness Simulator. Both simulators went through the validation studies with human subjects. We recorded simulation data during the validation studies, such as tool motion, position, and task time. Recorded data went through the data preprocessing; after the data cleaning, we extracted the recoded data features and normalized them. Normalized features were used to input various machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic regression (LR). The average accuracy was evaluated through k-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods validated using 10 subjects (5 experts, 5 novices) for the VATDEP simulator. 23 subjects (4 experts and 19 novices) for the Gentleness Simulator. The result shows a significant difference between the expert and novice population with the p  0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The VATDEP simulator's classification algorithms' average accuracy is 74% and 80% for the Gentleness Simulator. The results show that the normalized features and with KNN, SVM, and LR classifiers can provide accurate classification of experts and novices. The evaluation technique proposed in this study can develop surgical training by providing appropriate feedback to trainees to evaluate proficiency.  2021 ACM.","2021","2022-06-10 02:10:48","2022-07-31 14:10:06","","128-137","","","","","","","ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Virtual, Online, United states","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3471287.3471296","Learning algorithms; Support vector machines; E-learning; Nearest neighbor search; Laparoscopy; Simulators; Virtual reality; Machine Learning; Validation Study; Virtual Reality Simulator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After conducting credit risk assessment and early warning modeling for the enterprise, the initial preselected model is obtained. The information to be collected is first obtained by the web crawler from the target website to the temporary web page database, where it will go through a series of preprocessing steps such as completion, deduplication, analysis, and extraction to ensure that the crawled web page is correctly analyzed, to avoid incorrect data due to network errors during the crawling process.

Vertical plant wall systems, embedded with sensors and actuators, have become a promising application for indoor climate control. In this study, we explore the possibility of applying machine learning based anomaly detection methods to vertical plant wall systems so as to enhance the automation and improve the intelligence to realize predictive maintenance of the indoor climate. Two categories of anomalies, namely point anomalies and contextual anomalies are researched. Prediction-based and pattern recognition-based methods are investigated and applied to indoor climate anomaly detection. The results show that neural network-based models, specifically the autoencoder (AE) and the long short-term memory encoder decoder (LSTM-ED) model surpass the others in terms of detecting point anomalies and contextual anomalies, respectively, therefore can be deployed into vertical plant walls systems in industrial practice. Based on the results, a new data cleaning method is proposed and a prediction-based method is deployed to the cloud in practice as a proof-of-concept.

Four different methodologies to impute missing data in the raw data set are compared and implemented. The question of sensitivity of gap size and available data percentage on the imputation accuracy was tested. The cleaned data were then used for building energy forecasting. While the existing studies explored only the use of small recurrent networks of 2 layers and less, the question of whether a deep network of more than 2 layers would be performing better for building energy consumption forecasting should be explored. In addition, the problem of overfitting has been cited as a significant problem in using deep networks. In this study, the deep recurrent neural network is then used to explore the use of deeper networks and their regularization in the context of an energy load forecasting task.

With the infection of five new IoT devices per minute, the size of Mirai botnet was enlarged to 2.5 millions devices by the end of 2016. The continuous adaptation of the Mirai malware enables the modern variant to dynamically update its malware scripts on the fly to launch even more advanced and malevolent DDoS attacks, which dramatically escalates the level of difficulty with mitigating DDoS attacks. Many researchers endeavour to develop mitigation systems to keep up with the increasing security threats. Nonetheless, most presented models provide inefficient solutions either by utilising auxiliary servers at the host site, on the cloud or at dedicated data scrubbing centres. Since internet service providers (ISPs) connect the internet with users, the mitigation system should be deployed within the ISP domain to deliver a more efficient solution.

The applications like search engines, information retrieval, emails, etc., require user typing. In such applications, good spell-checker is essential to rectify the misspelling. Spell-checkers for western languages like English are very powerful and can handle any type of spelling errors, whereas in the case of Indian languages like Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kannada, Assamese, etc., the available spell-checkers are very basic ones. These spell-checkers are developed using traditional methods like statistical methods and rule-based methods. This article presents a novel model HINDIA to handle the spelling errors of the Hindi language, one of the most spoken languages in India. It utilizes a deep-learning method for spelling error detection and correction. The proposed spell-checking model works in two phases. In the first phase model identifies the erroneous words in the input sample and in the second phase it replaces the wrong words with the most probable correct words. Model HINDIA is developed using the attention-based encoderdecoder bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) which uses long short-term memory cells. Several modifications in the BiRNN have been made and network is fine-tuned to process the spelling errors of Hindi language. It uses publicly available dataset monolingual corpus developed by IIT Mumbai for training and testing. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in two scenarios. In the first scenario where the testing dataset is generated using split function. HINDIA performs significantly well with precision 0.86, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.78 and accuracy 0.80.

The novel algorithm is a combination of the factorization machine (FM) and the deep neural network (DNN), which adopts the one-vs-all strategy to fuse results from multiple base classifiers. 39,352 buildings affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake are taken as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-FMDNN. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model outperforms over many other popular machine learning methods due to the powerful feature learning ability, ultimately reaching an overall accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score in the value of 0.703, 0.737, and 0.702, respectively. Features associated with building structural characteristics are found to contribute more to classifying damage grades precisely. Besides, data preprocessing for data cleaning, encoding, and transformation is a necessary step to bring additional performance enhancement. For significance in the knowledge aspect, a novel multi-FMDNN algorithm is developed, which is superior in extracting both low- and high-order feature representation automatically from large volumes of destroyed buildings-related data and learning the optimal feature interactions simultaneously to pursue more accurate classification. For significance in the application aspect, the predicted results provide deep insights into a better understanding of the building vulnerability in seismic areas and inform data-driven decisions in disaster relief efforts. A promising future scope is to make full use of the available pre-event data along with some post-event data, which is possible to return fairly promising predictions and reduce the burden in earthquake field investigations for rapid responses. In future work, advanced techniques associated with data augment, hyperparameter optimization, and others will be implemented to constantly improve the overall accuracy and generalizability of the prediction model.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2022-06-10 02:10:49","2022-07-31 05:53:50","","","","","77","","Sustainable Cities and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103574","Factorization; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Network security; Network architecture; Metadata; Buildings; Disasters; Disaster prevention; Earthquakes; Automated evaluation; Deep neural network; Earthquake-induced building damage; Factorization machine; EARTHQUAKE RESILIENCE; EXPERT-SYSTEM; LOGIC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the battery is a complex electrochemical system with hardly observable and simulatable internal chemical reactions, and it is challenging to estimate the state of battery accurately. This paper proposes a novel flexible and reliable battery management method based on the battery big data platform and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology. First of all, to integrate the battery big data resources in the cloud, a Cyber-physical battery management framework is defined and served as the basic data platform for battery modeling issues. And to improve the quality of the collected battery data in the database, this work reports the first attempt to develop an adaptive data cleaning method for the cloud battery management issue. Furthermore, a deep learning algorithm-based feature extraction model, as well as a feature-oriented battery modeling method, is developed to mitigate the under-fitting problem and improve the accuracy of the cloud-based battery model. The actual operation data of electric buses is used to validate the proposed methodologies. The maximum data restoring error can be limited within 1.3% in the experiments, which indicates that the proposed data cleaning method is able to improve the cloud battery data quality effectively. Meanwhile, the maximum SoC estimation error in the proposed feature-oriented battery modeling method is within 2.47%, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2022-06-10 02:11:05","2022-07-31 14:44:04","","","","","33","","Journal of Energy Storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2020.102064","Big data; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Information management; Embedded systems; Battery management systems; Electric vehicles; Cyber Physical System; Secondary batteries; System-on-chip; Battery energy storage; Cyber-physical battery management system; MODEL; ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; STATE; POWER; CHARGE ESTIMATION; DATA ANALYTICS; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; INTEGRATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, dredging construction productivity is affected by many factors such as soil, hydrology, meteorology and underwater sundries, making it difficult to obtain accurate prediction results. This paper presents a new integrated approach for using intelligent data mining algorithms to analyze dredger monitoring data and estimate the effective productivity. Through these combination algorithms, alongside Lasso and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), the key features affecting the productivity are filtered out from a 255-dimensional monitoring data set. The continuous mean data cleaning method is proposed according to the characteristics of the filtered data, followed by a clean-up of the feature data to increase smoothness. Four machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, K-Nearest, Naive Bayes and eXtreme Gradient Enhancement (XGBoost), are used to estimate and analyze the productivity of a cutter suction dredger and applied to actual engineering cases. The results show that the prediction accuracy of XGBoost exceeds 90%, which is better than other algorithms used. Finally, the model is compared with the predictive model trained by the characteristics that influence productivity derived from the traditional method. The results still show that the XGBoost model with features obtained from machine learning as input terms has a better prediction effect.

It is shown that only 5% of switched labels lead to a decrease of performances. Therefore, the true class of an instance must be distinguished from its observed label. In the past decade, classification in presence of label noise was the topic of interest. Several scholars focused on kNN-based approaches for data cleansing. These types of approaches often are susceptible to high label noise rate and when a batch of instances with noisy labels are exist they may deteriorate the results. The problem arises since the methods have a local view of instances. Another approach is to have a global view of instances. In a global view, instances with large distance from their respective classes are detected as noisy. A potential problem however is the determination of a threshold. An inappropriate threshold may lead to detection of a correct instance as noisy instance. In this paper a new method for label denoising based on Bayesian aggregation is proposed which solves the problems of kNN-based approaches by aggregating the local and global views of instances. The aggregation of local and global information leads to a more robust and accurate detection of instances with noisy labels and estimation of their true labels. The experimental results show the capabilities and robustness of the proposed method.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2017","2022-06-10 02:11:07","2022-07-31 05:44:33","","903-914","","3","8","","International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13042-015-0474-y","Supervised learning; Chemical detection; Data cleansing; Label noise; Bayesain aggregation; Mislabeled data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identifying entities across heterogeneous data sources is paramount to many research fields, such as data cleaning, data integration, information retrieval and machine learning. The aligning process is not only overwhelmingly expensive for large data sources since it involves all tuples from two or more data sources, but also need to handle heterogeneous entity attributes. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach, called EnAli, to match entities across two or more heterogeneous data sources. EnAli employs a generative probabilistic model to incorporate the heterogeneous entity attributes via employing exponential family, handle missing values, and also utilize the locality sensitive hashing schema to reduce the candidate tuples and speed up the aligning process. EnAli is highly accurate and efficient even without any ground-truth tuples. We illustrate the performance of EnAli on re-identifying entities from the same data source, as well as aligning entities across three real data sources. Our experimental results manifest that our proposed approach outperforms the comparable baseline.","2019-02","2022-06-10 02:11:07","2022-07-31 14:00:29","","157-69","","1","13","","Frontiers of Computer Science","","Front.

It also decreases the quantity of line loss incurred in Smart Grid (SG). But, uncertainities in demand and supply of the electricity might lead to instability in P2P market for both prosumer and consumer. In recent times, numerous Machine Learning (ML)-enabled load predictive techniques have been developed, while most of the existing studies did not consider its implicit features, optimal parameter selection, and prediction stability. In order to overcome fulfill this research gap, the current research paper presents a new Multi-Objective Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (MOGOA) with Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM)-based short-term load predictive technique i.e., MOGOA-DELM model for P2P Energy Trading (ET) in SGs. The proposed MOGOA-DELM model involves four distinct stages of operations namely, data cleaning, Feature Selection (FS), prediction, and parameter optimization. In addition, MOGOA-based FS technique is utilized in the selection of optimum subset of features. Besides, DELM-based predictive model is also applied in forecasting the load requirements. The proposed MOGOA model is also applied in FS and the selection of optimal DELM parameters to improve the predictive outcome. To inspect the effectual outcome of the proposed MOGOA-DELM model, a series of simulations was performed using UK Smart Meter dataset. In the experimentation procedure, the proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.80% and the results established the superiority of the proposed model in predicting the testing data.  2021 Tech Science Press.

Among various contributing factors to the runway overrun incident, long landing plays an important role. However, existing studies for long landing prediction mainly depend on classic machine learning methods and handcrafted features. As a result, they usually require much expert knowledge and provide unsatisfactory results. To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative deep sequence-to-sequence model which utilizes QAR (Quick Access Recorder) data for accurate long landing pre- diction. Specifically, to cope with the high heterogeneity of QAR dataset, a data pre-processing procedure is first proposed which includes data cleaning, interpolation and normalization steps. Second, to avoid the noises incurred by too many QAR parameters and relieve the reliance on expert experience, the GBDT (gradient boosting decision trees) model is employed to choose the most relevant parameters as features. Then a CNN-LSTM and TG-attention encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to accurately predict future aircraft ground speed and radio height sequences, based on which the touchdown distance can be finally calculated. Experimental results on a large QAR dataset with 44,176 A321 flights validate effectiveness of the proposed method. 2021 The Authors.

In this study, an efficient heart disease prediction is developed based on optimal feature selection. Initially, the data pre-processing process is performed using data cleaning, data transformation, missing values imputation, and data normalisation. Then the decision function-based chaotic salp swarm (DFCSS) algorithm is used to select the optimal features in the feature selection process. Then the chosen attributes are given to the improved Elman neural network (IENN) for data classification. Here, the sailfish optimisation (SFO) algorithm is used to compute the optimal weight value of IENN. The combination of DFCSS-IENN-based SFO (IESFO) algorithm effectively predicts heart disease. The proposed (DFCSS-IESFO) approach is implemented in the Python environment using two different datasets such as the University of California Irvine (UCI) Cleveland heart disease dataset and CVD dataset. The simulation results proved that the proposed scheme achieved a high-classification accuracy of 98.7% for the CVD dataset and 98% for the UCI dataset compared to other classifiers, such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbour, Elman neural network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree.","2020-12","2022-06-10 02:11:07","2022-07-31 14:03:10","","380-90","","6","14","","IET Systems Biology","","IET Syst.

The problem exists in applications where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial responses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation, classification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing features as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of samples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have missing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is observed for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint from the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient algorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the extended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world hydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature distribution in training samples is multi-modal. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

First, this paper proposes the data cleaning and modeling methods for expressing Nanjing's DTTN as a complex network. Second, the three consecutive weeks' data are cleaned to establish 21 DTTNs based on the proposed big data processing technology. Then, multiple topology measures that characterize the complexities' day-to-day dynamic evolution of these networks are provided. Third, these measures of 21 DTTNs are calculated and subsequently explained with actual implications. They are used as a training set for modeling the BP neural network which is designed for predicting DTTN complexities evolution. Finally, the reliability of the designed BP neural network is verified by comparing with the actual data and the results obtained from ARIMA method simultaneously.

However, UAV images crowned with small-sized, highly dense, and overlapping spikes cause the accuracy to decrease for detection. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv5 (You Look Only Once)-based method to detect wheat spikes accurately in UAV images and solve spike error detection and miss detection caused by occlusion conditions. The proposed method introduces data cleaning and data augmentation to improve the generalization ability of the detection network. The network is rebuilt by adding a microscale detection layer, setting prior anchor boxes, and adapting the confidence loss function of the detection layer based on the IoU (Intersection over Union). These refinements improve the feature extraction for small-sized wheat spikes and lead to better detection accuracy. With the confidence weights, the detection boxes in multiresolution images are fused to increase the accuracy under occlusion conditions. The result shows that the proposed method is better than the existing object detection algorithms, such as Faster RCNN, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), RetinaNet, and standard YOLOv5. The average accuracy (AP) of wheat spike detection in UAV images is 94.1%, which is 10.8% higher than the standard YOLOv5. Thus, the proposed method is a practical way to handle the spike detection in complex field scenarios and provide technical references for field-level wheat phenotype monitoring.  2021 by the authors.

As the total sleep time is essential to assess the sleep apnea severity, a sleep-wake classifier was developed based on heart rate and respiration. These two signals were selected as they can be measured using unobtrusive sensors. A 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to classify 30s epochs of tachograms and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals. The input based on beat-to-beat variability allows the use of different sensor types. A dataset of 56 patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) below 10 was used to train and validate the network. This CNN was applied to an independent test set of ECG and RIP signals of 25 subjects. Of these, 8 subjects were simultaneously monitored using an unobtrusive capacitive-coupled ECG (ccECG) sensor integrated in a mattress. Artefact removal and data correction was performed on this acquired data. The performance on the independent dataset of ECG and RIP is comparable to state-of-the-art, with ? = 0.48. However, application on the ccECG data resulted in a drop in performance, with ? = 0.30. This was caused by a low amount of remaining wake epochs after data cleaning. Importantly, the network classified 30s segments of sleep apnea patients, without relying on past or future information for feature extraction.  2020 Creative Commons; the authors hold their copyright.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:08","2022-07-31 04:18:58","","","","","2020-September","","","","Computing in Cardiology","","","","IEEE Computer Society","Rimini, Italy","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.22489/CinC.2020.147","Monitoring; Feature extraction; Cardiology; Convolutional neural networks; Biomedical signal processing; Wearable sensors; Electrocardiography; Capacitive sensors; Plethysmography; Sleep research; Wakes; Biomedical monitoring; Sleep apnea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ETA predictions are unreliable due to the lack of good quality historical data, while 'live' positions in mobile apps suffer from delays in data transmission. This study uses deep neural networks to predict the next position of a bus under various vehicle-location data-quality regimes. Additionally, we assess the effect of the target representation in the prediction problem by encoding it either as unconstrained geographical coordinates, progress along known trajectory or ETA at the next two stops. We demonstrate that without data cleaning, model predictions give false confidence if mean errors are used, highlighting the importance of a holistic assessment of the results. We show that target representation affects the prediction accuracy, by constraining the prediction space. The literature is vague about quality issues in public transport data. Here we show that noisy data is a problem and discuss simple but effective approaches to address these issues. Research generally only focuses on a single method of target representation. Therefore, comparing several methods is a useful addition to the literature. This gives insight into the value of addressing data quality issues in urban transport data to enable better predictions and improve the passenger experience. We show that 'rephrasing' the prediction problem by changing the target representation can yield massively improved predictions.

This paper proposes two novel methods for missing data imputation, named kEMI and kEMI+, that are based on the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for pre-imputation and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for posterior-imputation. The former is a local search mechanism that aims to automatically find the best value for k and the latter makes use of the best k nearest neighbours to estimate missing scores by learning global similarities. kEMI+ makes use of a novel information fusion mechanism. It fuses top estimations through the Dempster-Shafer fusion module to obtain the final estimation. They handle both numerical and categorical features. The performance of the proposed imputation techniques are evaluated by applying them on twenty one publicly available datasets with different missingness and ratios, and, then, compared with other state-of-the-art missing data imputation techniques in terms of standard evaluation measures such as the normalized root mean square difference and the absolute error. The attained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed novel missing data imputation techniques.

This method introduces an autoregressive exogenous model and fuzzy neural network to explore the underlying distribution characteristics of wind power systems by correlation analysis of the linear and nonlinear information contained in time-series data of the wind power system. In addition, in order to eliminate outliers in the original data set, an abnormal data cleaning approach combining quartile and two-stage clustering algorithm is employed to reduce the computation time and improve the model accuracy.

Training and validation dataset collection are required for a disease in each digestive organ under a similar image capture condition; this is the first step in system development. This data cleansing task in data collection causes a great burden among experienced endoscopists. Thus, this study classified upper gastrointestinal (GI) organ images obtained via routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) into precise anatomical categories using AlexNet. Method: In total, 85,246 raw upper GI endoscopic images from 441 patients with gastric cancer were collected retrospectively. The images were manually classified into 14 categories: 0) white-light (WL) stomach with indigo carmine (IC); 1) WL esophagus with iodine; 2) narrow-band (NB) esophagus; 3) NB stomach with IC; 4) NB stomach; 5) WL duodenum; 6) WL esophagus; 7) WL stomach; 8) NB oralpharynxlarynx; 9) WL oralpharynxlarynx; 10) WL scaling paper; 11) specimens; 12) WL muscle fibers during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); and 13) others. AlexNet is a deep learning framework and was trained using 49,174 datasets and validated using 36,072 independent datasets. Results: The accuracy rates of the training and validation dataset were 0.993 and 0.965, respectively. Conclusions: A simple anatomical organ classifier using AlexNet was developed and found to be effective in data cleansing task for collection of EGD images.

It brings the opportunity to use universal big data for further computation that may deliver new insights and automation system. The technology that enables this work is artificial intelligence (AI). As known, the utilization of AI technology is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily life. Furthermore, discussion related to AI has played an essential role in an organization's decision-making process. Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-to-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth. The end-to-end process begins with data collection covering various types of data (text, picture, audio, video, animation) and various methods (survey, observation, interview, experiment). Then, it continues with the pre-process data cleansing and process to determine data features, and seeks the relationship within them, using machine learning process with appropriate algorithms. The results may then be used for applications portfolio in order to improve organization strategies and programs. The organization's performance can be visualized from time to time for continuous quality improvement. The end-to-end cycles of processes continue, from data collection, data pre-processing and processing, performance computation monitoring (identification, classification, prediction, and prescription), improving strategy and program, and implementing in the real-life activities until generating more behavioral data, finding pattern and design the systems. As a whole, this end-to-end cycle leads us to an AI automation system, with the power to generate meaningful insights suited to solve current problems, predicting trending issues, and understanding phenomena.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:11","2022-07-31 03:52:44","","9-18","","","","","","","2020 5th International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security (IWBIS)","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IWBIS50925.2020.9255497","Big data; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Automation; neural nets; Artificial intelligence; data analysis; learning (artificial intelligence); Feature extraction; Decision making; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Security of data; Application programs; decision making; Big Data; machine learning; deep learning; big data; Correlation; Classification algorithms; artificial intelligence; AI; automation system; end-to-end cycle processes; finding pattern; ICT; Enterprise resource planning; PERFORMANCE; LOG DATA; NEWS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It plays an important role in data cleansing and integration. Advanced entity matching techniques focus on extracting syntactic or semantic features from record pairs via complex neural architectures or pre-trained language models. However, the performances always suffer from noisy or missing attribute values in the records. We observe that comparing one record with several relevant records in a collective manner allows each pairwise matching decision to be made by borrowing valuable insights from other pairs, which is beneficial to the overall matching performance. In this paper, we propose a generic one-to-set neural framework named GNEM for entity matching. GNEM predicts matching labels between one record and a set of relevant records simultaneously. It constructs a record pair graph with weighted edges and adopts the graph neural network to propagate information among pairs. We further show that GNEM can be interpreted as an extension and generalization of the existing pairwise matching techniques. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that GNEM consistently outperforms the existing pairwise entity matching techniques and achieves up to 8.4% improvement on F1-Score compared with the state-of-the-art neural methods.","2021-04-19","2022-06-10 02:11:11","2022-07-31 13:37:45","","1686-94","","","","","","","WWW '21: Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3442381.3450119","Deep learning; neural nets; data analysis; Data Analytics; Semantics; World Wide Web; feature extraction; pattern matching; data integration; graph theory; Deep learning, Graph neural network, Entity matching; Graph structures; RULE-BASED METHOD; Entity matching; Graph neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If there is no good translation mechanism for such a widely used language, it will bring trouble to both study and life. At present, the world's major platforms are committed to the study of English translation strategies. There are translation platforms from different regions and different translation mechanisms. These translation data from different translation platforms have the characteristics of large-scale, multisource, heterogeneity, high dimensions, and poor quality. However, such inconsistent translation data will increase the translation difficulty and translation time. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of translation data to achieve a better translation effect. How to provide a large-scale and efficient translation strategy needs to integrate the translation strategies of various platforms to perform heterogeneous translation data cleaning and fusion based on machine learning. At first, this paper represents the multisource, heterogeneous translation data model as tree-augmented naive Bayes networks (TANs) and naturally captures the relationship between the datasets through the learning of TANs structure and the probability distribution of input attributes and tuples, using data probability value to complete the classification of translation data cleaning. Then, a multisource, heterogeneous translation data fusion model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed, and RNN is used to control the node data of hidden layer to enhance the fault-tolerant ability in the fusion process and complete the construction of fusion model. Finally, experimental results show that TANs-based translation data cleaning method can effectively improve the cleaning rate with an average improvement of approximately 10% and cleaning time with an average reduce about 5%. In addition, RNN-based multisource translation data fusion method improves the shortcomings of the traditional fusion model and improves the practicability of the fusion model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), fusion time, and integrity.  2022 Hindawi Limited.

This is critical in high-impact applications such as data cleaning and user stitching. The state-of-the-art entity linkage pipelines mainly depend on supervised learning that requires abundant amounts of training data. However, collecting well-labeled training data becomes expensive when the data from many sources arrives incrementally over time. Moreover, the trained models can easily overfit to specific data sources, and thus fail to generalize to new sources due to significant differences in data and label distributions. To address these challenges, we present AdaMEL, a deep transfer learning framework that learns generic high-level knowledge to perform multi-source entity linkage. AdaMEL models the attribute importance that is used to match entities through an attribute-level self-attention mechanism, and leverages the massive unlabeled data from new data sources through domain adaptation to make it generic and data-source agnostic. In addition, AdaMEL is capable of incorporating an additional set of labeled data to more accurately integrate data sources with different attribute importance. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results with 8.21% improvement on average over methods based on supervised learning. Besides, it is more stable in handling different sets of data sources in less runtime. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

In existing medical data classification methods, initially, the medical data pre-processing is performed. After pre-processing feature selection is performed, otherwise, the process is more time consuming and has poor accuracy. Here we have proposed two algorithms for enhancing the classification performance on medical data. In first proposed method Bag of Words technique is used for better feature subset selection. Subsequently, the hybrid Fuzzy-Neural Network approach used that can handle imprecision in data while classification. This combination of feature selection technique and Fuzzy-Neural Network classifier approach gives enhanced classification accuracy. In the second proposed algorithm, we have integrated data cleaning technique to improve data quality as pre-processing technique along with bag of words and Fuzzy-Neural Network, this method performs classification on clean filtered data with appropriately reduced feature set that results in more accurate classification than the existing methods. Thus in proposed approaches we have tried to handle three issues, removing noise in data, optimal feature subset selection and handling imprecision in data. The comparative study of various medical datasets in terms of accuracy shows that the two proposed algorithms perform better as compared to existing techniques and the enhancement obtained is around 3% and 17% respectively. In addition the performance of Bag of Words feature selection method used in the proposed system is compared with two feature selection methods LSFS and SFFS.","2020-03","2022-06-10 02:11:12","2022-07-31 05:52:17","","133-42","","1","11","","Evolving Systems","","Evol.

While the approach was developed for better classification of features in a linear hyperspace, the same technique could be used to assist other classification techniques by auto generating features which add lift to existing feature space.Our approach has had positive uplift for some of the simplistic kernels within SVM literature and has had negative uplift for the more complicated kernel functions.

It implies various theories that don't consider many precise indicators of confirming bipolar disorder. Therefore, this manuscript presents a novel framework capable of treating the dataset of depression and fine-tune it appropriately to subject it further to a machine learning-based predictive scheme. The proposed system subjects its dataset for a series of data cleaning operations followed by data preprocessing using a standard scale of rating bipolar level. Further usage of feature engineering and correlation analysis renders more contextual inference towards its statistical score.

In a typical data-analysis pipeline, data cleaning is the most cost-intensive, laborious, and time-consuming step. Unclean dataset or partially cleaned dataset can lead to incorrect training of machine learning models and result in wrong conclusions. Generally, data-scientists examine null, missing, or duplicate values, and the dataset is cleaned by removing the entire record or imputing the values. However, deleting the records, or imputing the values cannot be termed as comprehensive cleaning, as these cleaning techniques may result in a reduction in the population of data, and increased error in estimation due to biased values. For systematically cleaning an unclean dataset, it is necessary to comply with the data quality dimensions such as completeness, validity, consistency, accuracy, and conformity. The errors described as violations of expectations for completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency and other dimensions of data quality often impede the successful completion of information processing streams and consequently degrade the dependent business processes. Therefore, educating a data-scientist for comprehensively cleaning a raw-dataset acquired for analysis is an incremental learning process. Moreover, for extensive training on cleaning a dataset on different quality dimensions, it is necessary to provide a variety of datasets that are unclean on various data quality dimensions. Hence, in this paper, we present DWreck, a data wrecker framework for generating unclean datasets by counterproductively applying different data quality dimensions. The DWreck framework is designed on the principles of microservices architecture pattern. For allowing function-specific extensibility, the DWreck comprises four groups of microservices: (a) Dataset Profiling, (b) Data type Processing, (c) Counterproductive Dimensions, and (d) Miscellaneous. The orchestrator coordinates the different microservices in a complex workflow that is further split into three sub-workflows to generate an unclean (wrecked) dataset as an output. Finally, we evaluate the DWreck framework on twenty seed-datasets to generate corresponding wrecked datasets.","2020","2022-06-10 02:11:13","2022-07-31 14:05:49","","78-87","","","","","","","2020 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService).

Motivated by this, this paper conducts an experimental comparison for the effects of missing, inconsistent, and conflicting data on classification and clustering models. From the experimental results, we observe that dirty-data impacts are related to the error type, the error rate, and the data size.

Numerous data in these disciplines are sequence of observations measured as functions of time, which can be further used for different applications via analytical or data analytics techniques (e.g., to forecast future price, climate change, etc.). However, presence of outliers can cause significant uncertainties to interpretation results; hence, it is essential to remove the outliers accurately and efficiently before conducting any further analysis. A total of 17 techniques that belong to statistical, regression-based, and machine learning (ML) based categories for outlier detection in timeseries are applied to the oil and gas production data analysis. 15 of these methods are utilized for production data analysis for the first time. Two state-of-the-art and high-performance techniques are then selected for data cleaning which require minimum control and time complexity. Moreover, performances of these techniques are evaluated based on several metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa to rank the techniques. Results show that eight unsupervised algorithms outperform the rest of the methods based on the synthetic case study with known outliers. For example, accuracies of the eight shortlisted methods are in the range of 0.830.99 with a precision between 0.83 and 0.98, compared to 0.650.82 and 0.070.77 for the others. In addition, ML-based techniques perform better than statistical techniques. Our experimental results on real field data further indicate that the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Fulford-Blasingame methods are superior to other outlier detection frameworks for outlier detection in production data, followed by four others including density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD). Even though the techniques are examined with oil and gas production data, but the same data cleaning workflow can be used to detect timeseries outliers in other disciplines.  2021","2022","2022-06-10 02:11:14","2022-07-31 04:53:30","","","","","191","","Expert Systems with Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116371","Data handling; Diagnosis; Data Analytics; Statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Uncertainty analysis; Gas industry; Climate change; Outlier detection; Performance evaluation; Binary classification; Decline curve analysis; Production data analysis; ANOMALY DETECTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in this paper, we study the eavesdropping prevention of data repair in IoT environments based on network coding. We theoretically derive the relation between security level and storage in heterogeneous IoT systems. To further reduce the repair bandwidth, we exploit recurrent neural network for the storage failure prediction. Under the condition when failure probability and workloads of storage devices are considered, two allocation algorithms are proposed to avoid data repair.

We train and evaluate machine learning models for energy prediction, demonstrating that deep neural networks attain the highest accuracy.

Existing assessment methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone. The use of machine learning for BCA can effectively solve the above problems. However, the large amount of label noise in the dataset severely affected the performance of the BCA model. In this paper, we present an effective label ranking approach for BCA (LR-BCA). Our proposed LR-BCA method considers the natural order relationship between bridge condition ratings. Moreover, a heuristic data cleaning (HDC) approach is proposed for cleaning bridge condition dataset. The HDC method firstly identifies all the label conflict examples, then iteratively filters out the noise. Experimental results on real-world dataset confirm the effectiveness of the HDC method and demonstrate that our proposed LR-BCA method achieves 99% Top-2 accuracy, which is highly competitive compared to baseline methods.  2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, the low-quality of data in many IoT platforms, especially those composed of heterogeneous devices, is hindering the development of high-quality applications for those platforms. The solution presented in this article is intelligent data collaboration, i.e., the concept of deep learning providing IoT with the ability to adaptively collaborate to accomplish a task. Here, we outline the concept of intelligent data collaboration in detail and present a mathematical model in general form. To demonstrate one possible case where intelligent data collaboration would be useful, we prepared an implementation called adaptive data cleaning (ADC), designed to filter noisy data out of temperature readings in an IoT base station network. ADC primarily consists of a denoising autoencoder LSTM for predictions and a four-level data processing mechanism to perform the filtering. Comparisons between ADC and a maximum slop method show ADC with the lowest false error and the best filtering rates.  2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","2021","2022-06-10 02:11:15","2022-07-31 05:51:29","","","","3","17","","ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3427912","Long short-term memory; Data handling; Internet of things; Edge computing; edge computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Internet of Things (IoT), Data collaboration, edge computing; BIG DATA; SYSTEM; ANALYTICS; THINGS; Data collaboration; DENOISING AUTOENCODER; INTERNET","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low Birth Weight (LBW) has become an increasingly common problem, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Therefore, an ability to predict the LBW is beneficial and a good preventive measure. It is also a good indicator of future health risks of that infant. This study is concerned about the implementation of predictive LBW models for rural and urban areas of Afghanistan based on the data obtained from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015. The main objective of the study is to identify the most suitable machine learning techniques (i.e. classifiers) among the five popular ones. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Prior to implementing the predictive models, data preprocessing is carried out. This is done by means of data cleansing and feature selection. The well-known Correlation based Feature Selection algorithm (CFS) is employed to select the top ten attributes. The classifier in this study comprises two categories, Normal and LBW. The preparation of the dataset is carefully done to ensure well-balanced samples in each category. The study reveals that Random Forest is the best classifier with an accuracy of 84.70% and 85.2% and with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 91.0% and 92.1% for both rural and urban areas, respectively.

The research describes the building of a proof-of-concept for an unsupervised data curation process addressing a basic form of data cleansing in the form of identifying redundant records through entity resolution and spelling corrections. The novelty of the approach is to use ER as the first step using an unsupervised blocking and stop word scheme based on token frequency. A scoring matrix is used for linking unstandardized references, and an unsupervised process for evaluating linking results based on cluster entropy. The ER process is iterative, and in each iteration, the match threshold is increased. The prototype was tested on 18 fully-annotated test samples of primarily synthetic person data varied in two different ways, good data quality versus poor data quality, and a single record layout versus two different record layouts. In samples with good data quality and using both single and mixed layouts, the final clusters had an average F-measure of 0.91, precision of 0.96, and recall of 0.87 outcomes comparable to results from a supervised ER process. In samples with poor data quality whether mixed or single layout, the average F-measure was 0.78, precision 0.74, and recall 0.83 showing that data quality assessment and improvement is still a critical component of successful data curation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of building an unsupervised ER engine to support data integration for good quality references while avoiding the time and effort to standardize reference sources to a common layout, design, and test matching rules, design blocking keys, or test blocking alignment. Also, the paper proposes how unsupervised data quality improvement processes could also be incorporated into the design allowing the model to address an even broader range of data curation applications.  2020 Science and Information Organization.

The accuracy is also known to suffer on dirty data. In this paper we define and evaluate tabular embeddings to help increase the accuracy.Embeddings, is a well-known dimensionality reduction technique, usually applied to represent (one-dimensional) text documents/sentences as vectors for further analytics [28], [7], [23]. Using embeddings lowers dimensionality, as well as the models trained with embeddings often exhibit higher accuracy, compared to the same trained without such, because the embeddings vectors store the context information. Our 2-dimensional embeddings are more suitable for tables rather than text. We justify their efficiency on fundamental tasks on tables such as classifying columns and tuples.We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and compare the Neural Network trained with tabular embeddings against the same trained without such embeddings. We report significant accuracy gains in tuple classification when using the Neural Network trained with our tabular embeddings - up to 17.6% delta in F-measure for Songs compared with the same without our embeddings.

Numerous machine learning approaches have proven effective in SDP. However, the unbalanced class distribution in SDP datasets could be a problem for some conventional learning methods. In addition, class overlap increases the difficulty for the predictors to learn the defective class accurately. In this study, we propose a new SDP model which combines class overlap reduction and ensemble imbalance learning to improve defect prediction. First, the neighbor cleaning method is applied to remove the overlapping non-defective samples. The whole dataset is then randomly under-sampled several times to generate balanced subsets so that multiple classifiers can be trained on these data. Finally, these individual classifiers are assembled with the AdaBoost mechanism to build the final prediction model. In the experiments, we investigated nine highly unbalanced datasets selected from a public software repository and confirmed that the high rate of overlap between classes existed in SDP data. We assessed the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods including conventional SDP models, imbalance learning and data cleaning methods. Test results and statistical analysis show that the proposed model provides more reasonable defect prediction results and performs best in terms of G-mean and AUC among all tested models.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2018","2022-06-10 02:11:18","2022-07-31 04:07:39","","97-125","","1","26","","Software Quality Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media, LLC","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-016-9342-6","Machine learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Software testing; Defects; Adaptive boosting; Computer software selection and evaluation; Software quality; Class overlap, Software defect prediction, Class imbalance, Machine learning; MACHINE; Class imbalance; QUALITY; Class overlap; Software defect prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose that this lead bias can be leveraged in our favor in a simple and effective way to pre-train abstractive news summarization models on large-scale unlabeled news corpora: predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an article. We collect a massive news corpus and conduct data cleaning and filtering via statistical analysis.

Via extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, we show that this approach can dramatically improve the summarization quality and achieve state-of-the-art results for zero-shot news summarization without any fine-tuning. For example, in the DUC2003 dataset, the ROUGE-1 score of BART increases 13.7% after the lead-bias pre-training.

Auto-WEKA is a tool to automate the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) optimization problem. In this paper, we extend the CASH problem and Auto-WEKA to support the MCPS, including preprocessing steps for both classification and regression tasks. We define the optimization problem in which the search space consists of suitably parameterized Petri nets forming the sought MCPS solutions. In the experimental analysis, we focus on examining the impact of considerably extending the search space (from approximately 22000 to 812 billion possible combinations of methods and categorical hyperparameters). In a range of extensive experiments, three different optimization strategies are used to automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available data sets. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial for different predictive models. We also present the results on seven data sets from real chemical production processes. Our findings can have a major impact on the development of high-quality predictive models as well as their maintenance and scalability aspects needed in modern applications and deployment scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The extension of Auto-WEKA to compose and optimize multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) developed as part of this paper is freely available on GitHub under GPL license, and we encourage practitioners to use it on a broad variety of classification and regression problems. The software can either be used as a blackbox-where search space is made of all possible WEKA filters, predictors, and metapredictors (e.g., ensembles)-or as an optimization tool on a subset of preselected machine learning methods. The application has a graphical user interface, but it can also run from command line and can be embedded in any project as a Java library. There are three main outputs once an Auto-WEKA run has finished: 1) the trained MCPS ready to make predictions on unseen data; 2) the WEKA configuration (i.e., parameterized components); and 3) the Petri net in a Petri Net Markup Language format that can be analyzed using any tool supporting this standard language. There are, however, some practical considerations affecting the quality of the results that must be taken into consideration, such as the CPU time budget or the search starting point. These are extensively discussed in this paper.","2019-04","2022-06-10 02:26:43","2022-07-31 15:45:26","","946-959","","2","16","","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Optimization; Petri nets; Computational modeling; Data models; Predictive models; Task analysis; Tools; Bayesian optimization; Automatic predictive model building and parameterization; combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) problem; data preprocessing; multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs); predictive modeling; SEARCH; SOFT SENSORS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the openness of the mariculture environment makes the variation of water quality nonlinear, dynamic and complex. Traditional methods face challenges in prediction accuracy and generalization performance. To address these problems, an accurate water quality prediction scheme is proposed for pH, water temperature and dissolved oxygen. First, we construct a new huge raw data set collected in time series consisting of 23,204 groups of data. Then, the water quality parameters are preprocessed for data cleaning successively through threshold processing, mean proximity method, wavelet filter, and improved smoothing method. Next, the correlation between the water quality to be predicted and other dynamics parameters is revealed by the Pearson correlation coefficient method. Meanwhile, the data for training is weighted by the discovered correlation coefficients. Finally, by adding a backward SRU node to the training sequence, which can be integrated into the future context information, the deep Bi-S-SRU (Bi-directional Stacked Simple Recurrent Unit) learning network is proposed. After training, the prediction model can be obtained.

In this paper we have developed suitable predictive models for successful early detection of cyber-attacks. It also looks to find key variables in water system infrastructure that are especially prone to cyber-attacks to safeguard them effectively. We demonstrated this using the iTrust Lab's Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset. We carried out data exploration and data cleaning before creating the predictive models for cyber-attack detection. Three different models were explored for the prediction of cyber-attacks which are Neural Network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Random Forest. We evaluated these models based on their predictive accuracy, robustness and the ratio of false-positive and false-negative results. Key variables were also determined by looking at the variable importance from the MARS and Random Forest models. Our models are able to improve the detection rate for cyber-attacks which allows the water infrastructure to quickly activate cyber-security measures to limit damage and improve security.","2020-08-21","2022-06-10 02:27:01","2022-07-31 02:10:37","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC50002.2020.9259535","Neural networks; Decision trees; Signal processing; Predictive analytics; Network security; Random forests; Crime; Computer crime; Damage detection; Water resources; Data models; Predictive models; Neural network; Adaptation models; Sensors; Attack detection; Cyber-attacks; Mars; Water infrastructure security; Water supply; Water treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owning to their large size, only slide-level labels or a handful of coarse annotations are usually provided for pathology images, which makes the training of the classifier challenging. In this study, we propose a conceptually simple, two-stage approach to classify small and large duct types in intrahepatic chalongio-carcinoma using only slide-level labels. Unlike conventional pathology image analysis methods employ multiple instance learning (MIL) applied to overcome the problem of the slide-level label, we introduce a novel label smoothing method to progressively refine the training labels to improve the classification accuracy. The main idea is that we introduce the hidden class, which is assumed to be mutually inclusive of all ground-truth classes and less confident for classification. By iteratively refining (i.e., smoothing) per-patch labels, we can extract and discard the hidden class from the training data. We demonstrate that the proposed label filtering scheme improves the classification accuracy by up to 30% compared to the baseline MIL method and 10% compared to the state-of-the-art noisy label cleaning method. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gene mutation prior information in the classification of two different duct types. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method may provide pathologists insight into the study of correlations between genetic and histologic subtypes.","2021-04-13","2022-06-10 02:27:02","2022-07-31 03:18:28","","1944-1948","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI48211.2021.9434095","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Pathology; Training; Training data; Smoothing methods; Biological system modeling; Image enhancement; Refining; Ducts; duct type; hidden class detection; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; multiple instance learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Sampling technology has been widely used in big data context. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Hence this article focuses on researching sampling for data profiling tasks in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.","2020","2022-06-10 02:27:03","2022-07-31 04:28:42","","72713-72726","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988120","Anomaly detection; Big data; Data handling; Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Digital storage; Data mining; Metadata; Big Data; Task analysis; Systematics; data profiling; large amount; Relational databases; sampling; Sampling methods; Importance sampling; DISCOVERY; DEPENDENCIES; DISTANCE THRESHOLDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clarity of vehicular data for efficient decision making is vital in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Huge volumes of vehicular data are collected and processed during vehicular transactions. Pre-processing the huge amounts of raw vehicular data followed by framing effective traffic rules to take appropriate rapid decisions by the ITS on the vehicles continues to be a challenging problem. Most of the current studies done on ITS have proposed decision making strategies to handle only specific vehicular events and many lacked framing intelligent dynamic decision rules along with appropriate actions, representing all traffic events prevailing in the vehicular environment. This study proposes a versatile decision engine implanted with a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, we propose a novel data cleaning algorithm to identify and remove dirty data from the voluminous vehicular dataset. In the second stage, a unique rule framing mechanism is suggested to frame dynamic traffic rules along with their actions using real-time vehicular data. The vehicular entities take suitable decisions to respond to the traffic events based on these rules and their associated actions. A new Naïve Bayesian classifier is proposed in this study to test the new rule framed with the trained rules set, either to accept or reject the new rule for further processing. The algorithms are developed and implemented using machine learning concepts. Experimental and comparative analysis was carried out with other related referred studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Although the proposed decision engine is generic enough for decision making in most ITS use-cases, discussion in this article elaborates on its applicability in use-cases provisioning trust management.","2020","2022-06-10 02:27:04","2022-07-31 14:05:29","","72757-72767","","","8","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987414","Cleaning; Machine learning; Decision making; Statistical tests; Intelligent systems; Behavioral research; Engines; Dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Task analysis; data pre-processing; artificial intelligence; rule framing; trust management; Vehicle dynamics; Vehicular networks; Acceptance tests; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; ALGORITHM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can create significant performance bottlenecks in various layers of an end-to-end communication path, including the scheduling of the spectrum, the resource requirements for processing the IoT data at the Edge and/or Cloud, and the attainable delay for critical emergency scenarios. Thus, it is required to classify or predict the time varying traffic characteristics of the IoT devices. However, this classification remains at large an open challenge. Most of the existing solutions are based on machine learning techniques, which nonetheless present high computational cost while non considering the fine-grained flow characteristics. To this end, in this paper we design a two-stage classification framework that utilizes both the network and statistical features to characterize the IoT devices in the context of a smart city. We firstly perform the data cleaning and preprocessing of the data and then analyze the dataset to extract the network and statistical features set for different types of IoT devices.

The complicated production process of steel products makes it difficult to find the causes of surplus materials. In this work, we propose a surplus material prediction problem and solve it based on statistical analysis and machine learning methods. In the concerned problem, we predict whether there are surplus materials under a given group of production parameters. The dataset used in this work is from a real-world three-month steel coil production process. First, data cleaning is conducted to standardize the industrial dataset. Then, the production parameters highly correlated with surplus material prediction results are selected by a series of feature selection methods. Finally, two prediction models based on extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression are presented according to the selected features. The experimental results reveal that the proposed prediction models have similar effectiveness. A visible regression function makes the logistic regression method more suitable for practical application.","2020-05-01","2022-06-10 02:27:04","2022-07-31 14:25:16","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Journal Abbreviation: 2020 29th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/WOCC48579.2020.9114917","Learning systems; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Predictive analytics; Logistic regression; machine learning; Predictive models; Production; Statistical analysis; Boosting; Wireless communication; extreme gradient boosting; industrial data; logistic regression; Surplus material prediction; Ultraviolet sources; Optical communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 29th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed approach includes node classification module and confident learning module, where the confident learning module selects clean nodes with high confident labels for node classification module to train an accurate model in the graphs with label noise. Pseudo label method is further applied on unlabeled data to increase samples for confident learning and improve the classification performance of subsequent node classification module.

This paper presents two approaches for the detection and imputation of anomalies in time series data. Autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are used to extract the characteristics of time series. Anomalies are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals, and the anomalous data points are imputed using the ARX and ANN models. Because the anomalies affect the model coefficients, the data cleaning process is performed iteratively. The models are re-learned on “cleaner” data after an anomaly is imputed. The anomalous data are reimputed to each iteration using the updated ARX and ANN models. The ARX and ANN data cleaning models are evaluated on natural gas time series data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed approaches are able to identify and impute anomalous data points. Forecasting models learned on the unclean data and the cleaned data are tested on an uncleaned out-of-sample dataset. The forecasting model learned on the cleaned data outperforms the model learned on the unclean data with 1.67% improvement in the mean absolute percentage errors and a 32.8% improvement in the root mean squared error. Existing challenges include correctly identifying specific types of anomalies such as negative flows.","2017-09","2022-06-10 02:27:21","2022-07-31 14:31:32","","3352-3359","","5","32","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cleaning; Forecasting; Time series analysis; time series; Outlier detection; Artificial neural networks; Data models; Predictive models; ANN; ARX; Autoregressive processes; hypothesis testing; imputation; OUTLIER DETECTION; PREDICTION; NOVELTY DETECTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This causes penetrations and voltage surges, system instability, inefficient utilities planning and financial loss. Forecast models can help; however, time stamp, forecast horizon, input correlation analysis, data pre and post-processing, weather classification, network optimization, uncertainty quantification and performance evaluations need consideration. Thus, contemporary forecasting techniques are reviewed and evaluated. Input correlational analyses reveal that solar irradiance is most correlated with Photovoltaic output, and so, weather classification and cloud motion study are crucial. Moreover, the best data cleansing processes: normalization and wavelet transforms, and augmentation using generative adversarial network are recommended for network training and forecasting. Furthermore, optimization of inputs and network parameters, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is emphasized. Next, established performance evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE are discussed, with suggestions for including economic utility metrics. Subsequently, modelling approaches are critiqued, objectively compared and categorized into physical, statistical, artificial intelligence, ensemble and hybrid approaches. It is determined that ensembles of artificial neural networks are best for forecasting short term photovoltaic power forecast and online sequential extreme learning machine superb for adaptive networks; while Bootstrap technique optimum for estimating uncertainty. Additionally, convolutional neural network is found to excel in eliciting a model's deep underlying non-linear input-output relationships. The conclusions drawn impart fresh insights in photovoltaic power forecast initiatives, especially in the use of hybrid artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.","2020-05-01","2022-06-10 03:07:29","2022-07-31 01:32:25","","109792","","","124","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109792","Long short-term memory; Electric power transmission networks; Learning systems; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Deep neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Convolution; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Wavelet transforms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Solar power generation; Solar energy; Long short term memory; Deep convolutional neural network; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting technique; Solar power; Wavelet transform; Statistical methods; Losses; System stability; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BOLTZMANN MACHINES; CLOUD DETECTION; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; HYBRID APPROACH; LONG-TERM; OUTPUT POWER; PROCESSING STRATEGY; TIME-SERIES; WIND-SPEED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Medical informatics (MI) is an important cross-disciplinary field that, along with its applications, has received massive funding from the Chinese government. However, the question of how to evaluate China's input and output in MI remains important and complex issue of great significance for China and the rest of the world. Objective This paper analyzed, for the first time, the quality and quantity of research by Chinese academics in MI based on their articles published in international specialty journals in recent years and examined MI research hotspots in China. Our purpose is to summarize the experiences and lessons learned by China and the rest of the world as they develop MI. Method We targeted 18 MI journals listed in the JCR 2016 report and searched for papers published by Chinese academics in these 18 journals in the WOS and PUBMED databases and on journal sites. We also performed data cleansing and categorized the obtained information. We used Excel, SPSS, Ucinet and NetDraw to conduct quantitative analyses on the research papers. Results A total of 1340 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this study. We observed a significant upward trend in the number of articles published over time, particularly after 2011. Lei Jianbo, Huang Zhengxing and Li Jin-song are active Chinese authors in the MI discipline who have written many high-quality publications. Meanwhile, universities remain the primary breeding grounds for scientific research: 93.36% of the articles came from universities. Zhejiang University published the most first-author articles, whereas Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University produced 17.76% of the total articles. According to the lists of authors, 24% of the papers were co-authored with foreign researchers. This rate of cooperation is increasing each year, from 5.88% to the current rate of 39.04%. An analysis of keywords showed that “EMR”, “SVM”, “Authentication”, “Telecare medical information system”, “EEG”, “ECG” and “RFID” were the most frequently searched terms in popular technological fields, including artificial intelligence and image processing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-frequency keywords and a broadening range of research fields, which has led to the emergence of several research hotspots, including MI systems, mobile health care, telecare, data mining and machine learning. Conclusions Through the quantitative analysis of publications, we discovered the emergence of three stages – infancy, slow growth and rapid growth – in China's MI research in recent years as academics make achievements in their research works. The global influence of Chinese academics is growing, and they are making increasingly conscious efforts to enter into research collaborations with foreign researchers. The findings of Chinese academics’ publications are gaining international recognition.","2018-10-01","2022-06-10 03:07:29","2022-07-31 13:54:25","","75-85","","","164","","Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Medical informatics; Article; China; Discipline development; Output; Research paper quantitative analysis; BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS; EDUCATION; TRENDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a framework of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for ship motion data. The framework consists of four components: data cleaning, surrogate model, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and results visualization. Data cleaning focuses on the removal of noise, and necessary transformation for the easy analysis. An artificial neural network (ANN) based surrogate model is constructed on the basis of cleaned ship motion data. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis would be performed on the sample or weights which the ANN based surrogate model generated. The result of the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can be beneficial to the optimization of data-driven ship motion models. Three distinctive sensitivity analysis (SA) methods (Garson/Morris/Sobol), and PDF-based and CDF-based uncertainty methods are investigated in two types of ship motion datasets with and without environmental factors. The experimental results also demonstrate the proposed framework can be applied to estimate the sensitivity and uncertainty in different datasets.","2019-05-01","2022-06-10 03:07:29","2022-07-31 14:25:11","","261-272","","","179","","Ocean Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Data-driven; Offshore operations; Ship motion; FRAMEWORK; IDENTIFICATION; RS-HDMR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.","2020-09-01","2022-06-10 03:07:29","2022-07-30 20:20:17","","105658","","","144","","Accident Analysis & Prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105658","Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Forecasting; Information management; Advanced traffic management systems; Costs; Logistic regression; Vehicles; Real time systems; Accidents; Traffic control; Connected vehicle emulated data; Real-time crash potential prediction; Urban arterials; Speed control; MACHINE; FREEWAYS; INJURY SEVERITY; RISK PREDICTION; SHANGHAI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most existing approaches rely on either appliances’ signatures or their state transition patterns, both hard to obtain in practice. In addition, load data may be corrupted due to various reasons. To overcome the problems, this paper utilizes easily accessible knowledge of appliances and the sparsity of the switching events to design a Sparse Switching Event Recovering (SSER) method. Furthermore, a robust version of this method (RSSER) is developed to tackle the problems caused by corrupted data and unknown appliances. By minimizing the total variation of the sparse event matrix and introducing a virtual appliance, RSSER can obtain accurate energy disaggregation results in the presence of outliers, without using any explicit data cleansing method. To speed up RSSER, a Parallel Local Optimization Algorithm (PLOA) is proposed to solve the problem in active epochs of appliance activities in parallel. To automatically acquire the power consumption knowledge of appliances whose information is unknown, we develop a K-median clustering based power division approach and establish an appliance power configuration platform. Using real-world trace data from our energy monitoring platform, the performance of RSSER is compared with that of the state-of-the-art solutions, including the least square estimation methods and a machine learning method using iterative Hidden Markov Model. The results show that RSSER not only has an overall better performance in both detection accuracy and overhead, but also can tolerate the interference of corrupted data and unknown appliances.","2016-03-01","2022-06-10 03:07:30","2022-07-31 01:40:37","","8-19","","","9","","Sustainable Computing: Informatics and Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Optimization; Measurement; Energy disaggregation; Non-intrusive appliance load monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, most of the literature is concerned with classification of outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the subject-level, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset. Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and ground-truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level, the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the models across different data cleaning options. Environmental denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were strikingly robust and continued performing well even without preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche: supervised spatial filtering is practical for event-level prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple end-to-end learning.","2020-11-15","2022-06-10 03:07:30","2022-07-31 04:58:23","","116893","","","222","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Machine learning; EEG; Covariance; MEG/EEG; Neuronal oscillations; Riemannian geometry; Spatial filters; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CROSS-VALIDATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LINEAR-MODELS; MEG; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With sparse multivariate data obtained from geotechnical site investigation, it is impossible to identify outliers with certainty due to the distortion of statistics of geotechnical parameters caused by outliers and their associated statistical uncertainty resulted from data sparsity. This paper develops a probabilistic outlier detection method for sparse multivariate data obtained from geotechnical site investigation. The proposed approach quantifies the outlying probability of each data instance based on Mahalanobis distance and determines outliers as those data instances with outlying probabilities greater than 0.5. It tackles the distortion issue of statistics estimated from the dataset with outliers by a re-sampling technique and accounts, rationally, for the statistical uncertainty by Bayesian machine learning. Moreover, the proposed approach also suggests an exclusive method to determine outlying components of each outlier. The proposed approach is illustrated and verified using simulated and real-life dataset. It showed that the proposed approach properly identifies outliers among sparse multivariate data and their corresponding outlying components in a probabilistic manner. It can significantly reduce the masking effect (i.e., missing some actual outliers due to the distortion of statistics by the outliers and statistical uncertainty). It also found that outliers among sparse multivariate data instances affect significantly the construction of multivariate distribution of geotechnical parameters for uncertainty quantification. This emphasizes the necessity of data cleaning process (e.g., outlier detection) for uncertainty quantification based on geoscience data.","2021-01-01","2022-06-10 03:07:30","2022-07-31 14:28:38","","425-439","","1","12","","Geoscience Frontiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Outlier detection; Bayesian machine learning; Mahalanobis distance; Resampling by half-means; Site investigation; Sparse multivariate data; REGRESSION; MODEL; PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS; RELIABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, railroads lose hundreds of millions of dollars from accidents each year. Trends reveal that derailments consistently account for more than 70 % of the U.S. railroad industry’s average annual accident cost. Hence, knowledge of explanatory factors that distinguish derailments from other accident types can inform more cost-effective and impactful railroad risk management strategies. Five feature scoring methods, including ANOVA and Gini, agreed that the top four explanatory factors in accident type prediction were track class, type of movement authority, excess speed, and territory signalization. Among 11 different types of machine learning algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting method was most effective at predicting the accident type with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) metric of 89 %. Principle component analysis revealed that relative to other accident types, derailments were more strongly associated with lower track classes, non-signalized territories, and movement authorizations within restricted limits. On average, derailments occurred at 16 kph below the speed limit for the track class whereas other accident types occurred at 32 kph below the speed limit. Railroads can use the integrated data preparation, machine learning, and feature ranking framework presented to gain additional insights for managing risk, based on their unique operating environments.","2021-06-01","2022-06-10 03:07:31","2022-07-31 15:19:08","","106126","","","156","","Accident Analysis & Prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Machine learning; Risk management; Data cleaning; Feature engineering; Financial loss; Principle component analysis; MODELS; SEVERITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Primary space usage (PSU) is a typical and widely used commercial building categorization method. The PSU labels are ascertained once the buildings are put into use but not always modified on time when the building usages change, which may lead to false results in analysis. In this paper, we propose a method to identify mislabeled commercial buildings based on analysis of the energy time series collected by electric meters. The method is constructed as follows: (1) data cleaning and transformation; (2) three types of temporal feature extraction; (3) several single classifier training, and the ensemble classifier building; (4) mislabel building identification and correction. The method provides a supervise way to identify mislabeled building. We applied the method to a public dataset from the Department of General Services from Washington, D.C. and found that 22.4% of the buildings were mislabeled.

These are caused mainly due to off-nominal conditions, catastrophic events, and major failures, resulting in downtime conditions. An accurate and timely detection of downtime events provides crucial information for planning and decision-making. This study investigates the utility of wind power and wind speed as potential parameters for real-time downtime detection. Early and accurate detection of these anomalies using system outputs collected from monitoring stations is challenging and involved, especially when attempted in real-time. In this article, a real-time downtime detection framework is proposed that maps system outputs to turbine events - faults, scheduled, and unplanned maintenance - through online condition indicators. Without imposing strong distributional assumptions, using available training samples, an optimal, cost-sensitive real-time anomaly detection framework is proposed to determine whether a sample is anomalous. Considering the trade-off between misclassification errors and detection rates, detection studies are performed using wind power and speed - calibrated against available alarm classifiers - obtained from two Irish wind farms. The data cleaning and formatting for analysis was automated and subjected to classification with several levels of complexity. Recursive condition indicators (RCIs) such as Recursive Mahalanobis distance (RMD) and Recursive Residual Error (RRE) are chosen as features for classification. The real-time detection model becomes particularly useful when it is prohibitive to identify in advance the anomalies without a baseline of the system behaviour under such conditions. Case studies involving Irish wind Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data demonstrate the successful application of the proposed work for early and accurate downtime detection with comparison to a reference machine learning approach.","2021-12-01","2022-06-10 03:07:31","2022-07-31 15:36:18","","1969-1989","","","179","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.07.139","Anomaly detection; Wind power; Wind turbines; Decision making; Maintenance; Data acquisition; Economic and social effects; Real time systems; Downtime detection; Dynamic systems; Eigen perturbation; Real-time; Wind turbine; Dynamical systems; DIAGNOSIS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is difficult to identify a biological marker of disease when the traditional diagnostic labels themselves are not necessarily valid. Methods We worked with T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 1493 individuals comprising healthy control subjects, patients with psychosis, and their unaffected first-degree relatives. Specifically, the dataset included 176 bipolar disorder probands, 134 schizoaffective disorder probands, 240 schizophrenia probands, 362 control subjects, and 581 patient relatives. We assumed that there might be noise in the diagnostic labeling process. We detected label noise by classifying the data multiple times using a support vector machine classifier, and then we flagged those individuals in which all classifiers unanimously mislabeled those subjects. Next, we assigned a new diagnostic label to these individuals, based on the biological data (magnetic resonance imaging), using an iterative data cleansing approach. Results Simulation results showed that our method was highly accurate in identifying label noise. Both diagnostic and biotype categories showed about 65% and 63% of noisy labels, respectively, with the largest amount of relabeling occurring between the healthy control subjects and individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well as in unaffected close relatives. The extraction of imaging features highlighted regional brain changes associated with each group.

In IoT, various objects perform the tasks of sensing, communication, and computation for providing uninterrupted services (e.g., e-health, e-transportation, security access, etc.) to the end users. In this era, Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) is an another paradigm of IoT developed to enhance the capabilities of intelligence in IoT objects where these objects can take independent decisions in any environment. IoT follows the service oriented architecture (SOA), in which the application layer is the topmost layer. It enables the IoT objects to interact with the other objects located across the globe. The power of learning, thinking, and understanding by these objects, can make the information access more accurate and reliable but Web spam is one of the challenges while accessing information from the web. It has been observed from the literature review that search engines are preferred mostly by the people for accessing information. The efficient ranking by the search engines can reduce the computational cost of information exchange by IoT objects. Search engines should be able to prevent the spam from being injected into the web. But, the existing techniques for this problem target in finding the spam after its occurrence in search engine result pages. So, in this proposal, we present an intelligent cognitive spammer framework, Cognitive spammer, which eliminates the spam pages during the web page rank score calculation by search engines. The framework update the Google’s ranking algorithm, PageRank in such a way that it automatically prevents link spam by considering the link structure of web for rank score computation. The updated PageRank algorithm provided the better ranking of web pages. The proposed framework is validated with the WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset. Before processing, the dataset is preprocessed with a new technique, called as ‘Split by Over-sampling and Train by Under-fitting’ to remove the trade off between imbalanced instances of target class. After data cleaning, we applied machine learning techniques (Bagged model, Boosted linear model, etc) with the web page features to make accurate predictions. The detection classifiers only consider the link features of the web page irrespective of the page content. Out of the fifteen classifiers, best three are ensemble, which results in better performance with overall accuracy improvement. Ten-fold cross validation has also been applied with the resulted ensemble model, which results in getting the accuracy of 99.6% in the proposed scheme.","2019-01-01","2022-06-10 03:07:32","2022-07-31 02:36:25","","381-404","","","90","","Future Generation Computer Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cognitive IoT; Internet of Things(IoT); PageRank; Web spam; ALGORITHMS; WEB; FEATURES; THINGS; IMAGES; INTERNET; COMPUTATION; OIL-SPILLS; RADIO; TRUST PROPAGATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Almost none of such papers include data cleaning and data quality assessment in their study design despite this being a very critical step during data mining. This paper presents 2 novel data cleaning methods that permit identification of animals with good and bad data quality. The first method is a deterministic or rule-based data cleaning method. Reproduction and mutation or life-changing events such as birth and death were converted to a symbolic (alphabetical letter) representation and split into triplets (3-letter code). The triplets were manually labeled as physiologically correct, suspicious, or impossible. The deterministic data cleaning method was applied to assess the quality of data stored in dairy herd management from 26 farms enrolled in the herd health management program from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Ghent University, Belgium. In total, 150,443 triplets were created, 65.4% were labeled as correct, 17.4% as suspicious, and 17.2% as impossible. The second method, a probabilistic method, uses a machine learning algorithm (random forests) to predict the correctness of fertility and mutation events in an early stage of data cleaning. The prediction accuracy of the random forests algorithm was compared with a classical linear statistical method (penalized logistic regression), outperforming the latter substantially, with a superior receiver operating characteristic curve and a higher accuracy (89 vs. 72%). From those results, we conclude that the triplet method can be used to assess the quality of reproduction data stored in dairy herd management software and that a machine learning technique such as random forests is capable of predicting the correctness of fertility data.","2017-05-01","2022-06-10 03:07:32","2022-07-31 05:07:46","","4078-4089","","5","100","","Journal of Dairy Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","random forests; data quality; dairy herd management software; dairy reproduction; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; PERFORMANCE; WORKLOAD; TIME; DISEASE; RECORDING-SYSTEM; SECONDARY DATA SOURCES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.","2020-11-10","2022-06-10 03:07:32","2022-07-31 01:44:11","","123142","","","273","","Journal of Cleaner Production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123142","Big data; Deep learning; Quality control; Digital storage; Information management; Security of data; Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Sustainable development; Smart city; Land use; Urban planning; Social media data; Urban landscape sustainability; Tourism; CHINA; AIR-QUALITY; COMMUTING PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GOOGLE STREET VIEW; LAND; MOBILITY INFORMATION; SMART CITY; SOCIAL-MEDIA DATA; TAXI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One prominent example in reinforcement learning is model-based planning, which specifically relates to transdiagnostic compulsivity. However, the reliability of computational model-derived measures such as model-based planning is unclear. Establishing reliability is necessary to ensure that such models measure stable, traitlike processes, as assumed in computational psychiatry. Although analysis approaches affect validity of reinforcement learning models and reliability of other task-based measures, their effect on reliability of reinforcement learning models of empirical data has not been systematically studied. Methods We first assessed within- and across-session reliability and effects of analysis approaches (model estimation, parameterization, and data cleaning) of measures of model-based planning in patients with compulsive disorders (n = 38). The analysis approaches affecting test-retest reliability were tested in 3 large generalization samples (healthy participants: n = 541 and 111; people with a range of compulsivity: n = 1413). Results Analysis approaches greatly influenced reliability: reliability of model-based planning measures ranged from 0 (no concordance) to above 0.9 (acceptable for clinical applications). The largest influence on reliability was whether model-estimation approaches were robust and accounted for the hierarchical structure of estimated parameters. Improvements in reliability generalized to other datasets and greatly reduced the sample size needed to find a relationship between model-based planning and compulsivity in an independent dataset. Conclusions These results indicate that computational psychiatry measures such as model-based planning can reliably measure latent decision-making processes, but when doing so must assess the ability of methods to estimate complex models from limited data.","2020-06-01","2022-06-10 03:07:32","2022-07-31 05:56:49","","601-609","","6","5","","Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reinforcement learning; Reliability; Computational modeling; Compulsivity; Computational psychiatry; Psychometrics; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; ERROR; TRACKING; DECISION-MAKING; PROTECTS; REWARD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, reliable demand predictions can be imperative in planning voluntary blood donation campaigns and improving blood availability within Ghana hospitals. However, most historical datasets on blood demand in Ghana are predominantly contaminated with missing values and outliers due to improper database management systems. Consequently, time-series prediction can be challenging since data cleaning can affect models’ predictive power. Also, machine learning (ML) models’ predictive power for backcasting past years’ lost data is understudied compared to their forecasting abilities.

KNN performed well in forecasting blood demand (12.55% error); whereas, ELM achieved the highest backcasting power (19.36% error).

Land cover takes advantage of CNN development for a large type of applications as water management and urban growing. However, to perform a land cover with numerous features – classes in classical CNN terminology, CNN models require a significant number of layers and neurons, resulting in high computational costs. To address this problem, a methodology is proposed in this paper to build a land cover using the aggregation of several CNN models. The overall process is based on 7 steps. The first two steps are the dataset creation and arrangement in smaller dataset fit for the specific features to detect. Then, a CNN architecture is built and validated on each sub-dataset corresponding to each class. Post-processing is conducted on each prediction before assembling the results. In the last step, a data cleaning is performed, giving the final land cover. The land cover of a rural area in Thailand is performed as a demonstration of the method, using satellite images with a resolution of 0.15 m/pixel. A 5-class (buildings, crops, forests, roads, and wastelands) dataset is created, consisting of a total of 1 million tiles of 64 × 64 pixels. The prediction results using the developed CNN model show an accuracy greater than 90% for each class, except for the road class where the accuracy only reaches 72%. Post-processing is performed on each of the 5 predictions. Only the 4 best results are retained and assembled to obtain the land cover, which generally corresponds to buildings, crops, forests, and wastelands. This method enables to identify by substitution with improved accuracy the last class whose prediction is the least accurate, and which generally corresponds to roads due to their small width relative to the tile size. The proposed methodology to perform a land cover by aggregating the prediction of different CNN models is found to predict correctly the land cover of two areas, especially roads can be classified, demonstrating the usefulness of the approach.","2022-04-01","2022-06-10 03:07:33","2022-07-31 05:44:21","","100740","","","26","","Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Convolutional neural network; Land cover; Satellite image; LOP BURI PROVINCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This raises important issues which become more challenging when the final goal is that of the analysis of the data for forecasting purposes or, more generally, for predictive tasks. This paper proposes a framework which supports predictive modeling tasks from streaming data coming from multiple geo-referenced sensors. In particular, we propose a distance-based anomaly detection strategy which considers objects described by embedding features learned via a stacked auto-encoder. We then devise a repair strategy which repairs the data detected as anomalous exploiting non-anomalous data measured by sensors in nearby spatial locations. Subsequently, we adopt Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) to predict/forecast values assumed by a target variable of interest for the repaired newly arriving (unlabeled) data, using the original feature representation or the embedding feature representation learned via the stacked auto-encoder. The workflow is implemented with distributed Apache Spark programming primitives and tested on a cluster environment. We perform experiments to assess the performance of each module, separately and in a combined manner, considering the predictive modeling of one-day-ahead energy production, for multiple renewable energy sites. Accuracy results show that the proposed framework allows reducing the error up to 13.56%. Moreover, scalability results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of speedup, scaleup and execution time under a stress test.","2019-07-01","2022-06-10 03:07:51","2022-07-31 02:32:28","","18-35","","","16","","Big Data Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Neural networks; Data repair; Geo-distributed big data; Gradient-boosting; Spatial autocorrelation; POWER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also compared the prediction performance of our CNN with other machine leaning (ML) algorithms such as an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), and a k-nearest neighbor (KNN), which used 11 HRV features extracted using traditional methods. The proposed CNN achieved relatively higher prediction accuracy of 84.6%, while the ANN, SVM, and KNN algorithms obtained prediction accuracies of 73.5%, 67.9%, and 65.9% using 11 HRV features, respectively.

For geographic classification of text, we demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art word-based text classification methods. The model was tested on four crowdsourced data sets made up of Wikipedia articles, online travel blogs, Geonames toponyms, and Twitter posts. Unlike word-based methods, which require data cleaning and pre-processing, the proposed model works for any language without modification and with classification accuracy comparable to existing methods. Using a synthetic data set with introduced character-level errors, we show it is more robust to noise than word-level classification algorithms. The results indicate that UTF-8 character-level convolutional neural networks are a promising technique for georeferencing noisy text, such as found in colloquial social media posts and texts scanned with optical character recognition. However, word-based methods currently require less computation time to train, so currently are preferable for classifying well-formatted and cleaned texts in single languages.","2018-04","2022-06-13 21:23:25","2022-07-31 02:54:00","","394-408","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000430399600002","","","","","","","NEURAL-NETWORKS; WEB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A misinterpretation of mammography may lead to an unneeded biopsy of the false-positive results, decreasing the patient's chances of survival. This study aims to increase the probability of early breast mass identification to ensure better treatment and minimize mortality risk. However, this study proposes a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to extract features of varying densities and classify normal and suspicious mammography regions. Two different experiments were carried out to validate the consistency of diagnoses and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks. Additionally, the deep features extracted are used to train the support vector machine algorithm, resulting in an outstanding performance in the second experiment. Furthermore, this study confirms an improvement in mass recognition accuracy through data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation. Our deep learning hybrid model obtained a classification accuracy of 97.8%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model's improvements are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist's strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients' mammography images. Background: Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters have paramount significance in mammography, which aids in mitigating the disease's complexities and curing it at early stages. However, a wrong mammogram interpretation may lead to an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive findings, which reduces the patient's survival chances. Consequently, approaches that learn to discern breast masses can reduce the number of misconceptions and incorrect diagnoses. Conventionally used classification models focus on feature extraction techniques specific to a particular problem based on domain information. Deep learning strategies are becoming promising alternatives to solve the many challenges of feature-based approaches. Methods: This study introduces a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based deep learning method to extract features at varying densities and discern mammography's normal and suspected regions. Two different experiments were carried out to make an accurate diagnosis and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). The in-depth features extracted from the ConvNet are also used to train the support vector machine algorithm to achieve excellent performance in the second experiment. Additionally, DCNN is the most frequently used image interpretation and classification method, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Moreover, this study pertains to data cleaning, preprocessing, and data augmentation, and improving mass recognition accuracy. The efficacy of all models is evaluated by training and testing three mammography datasets and has exhibited remarkable results. Results: Our deep learning ConvNet+SVM model obtained a discriminative training accuracy of 97.7% and validating accuracy of 97.8%, contrary to this, VGGNet16 method yielded 90.2%, 93.5% for VGGNet19, 63.4% for GoogLeNet, 82.9% for MobileNetV2, 75.1% for ResNet50, and 72.9% for DenseNet121. Conclusions: The proposed model's improvement and validation are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist's strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients' mammography images.","2021-09","2022-06-13 21:23:26","2022-07-31 02:18:14","","","","9","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000699435500001","","","","","","","deep learning; CLASSIFICATION; augmentation; breast cancer mass; computer-aided diagnosis; COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; deep transfer learning; mammography classification; MASSES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, patients with hypertension and diabetes are at high risk of encountering this disorder. The medical cost for a large group of chronic-disease patients has been the burden not only to the local hospitals, but also the country as awhole. Without forward planning, the allocated budget may not cover the expense of increasing cases. This research aims to develop an intelligent model to predict the duration to progress kidney disease in those patients with hypertension and diabetes. As such, the predictive model can help physicians to acknowledge patients' risk and set up a plan to prolong the progression duration, perhaps by modifying their behaviors. The methodology of data mining is employed for such cause, with records of 360 patients from Phan hospital's database in Chiang Rai province between 2004 and 2014. Prior model generation, the underlying data has gone through conventional steps of data cleaning and preparation, such that the problems of incomplete and biased data are resolved. To explore the baseline of prediction performance, four classical classification techniques are exploited to create the desired model. These include decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks. Based on 10-fold cross validation, the overall accuracy obtained with the aforementioned techniques is around 70% to 80%, with the highest of 86.7% being achieved by Artificial Neural Networks.","2016","2022-06-13 21:23:27","2022-07-31 04:45:43","","129-141","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000381747000011","","","","","","","Data mining; Prediction; Diabetes; RISK; VALIDATION; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; CKD Progression; Hypertension","","Lavangnananda, K; PhonAmnuaisuk, S; Engchuan, W; Chan, JH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","INTELLIGENT AND EVOLUTIONARY SYSTEMS, IES 2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Material and Methods Within this paper we developed a convolutional neural network which automatically detects the anteroposterior and posteroanterior view position of a chest radiograph. We trained two different network architectures (VGG variant and ResNet-34) with data published by the RSNA (26 684 radiographs, class distribution 46 % AP, 54 % PA) and validated these on a self-compiled dataset with data from the University Hospital Essen (4507, radiographs, class distribution 55% PA, 45% AP) labeled by a human reader. For visualization and better understanding of the network predictions, a Grad-CAM was generated for each network decision. The network results were evaluated based on the accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC), and the F1-score against the human reader labels. Also a final performance comparison between model predictions and DICOM labels was performed. Results The ensemble models reached accuracy and F1-scores greater than 95%. The AUC reaches more than 0.99 for the ensemble models. The Grad-CAMs provide insight as to which anatomical structures contributed to a decision by the networks which are comparable with the ones a radiologist would use. Furthermore, the trained models were able to generalize over mislabeled examples, which was found by comparing the human reader labels to the predicted labels as well as the DICOM labels.

Many studies on the potential roles of environmental factors in the transmission of the novel COVID-19 have been published. However, the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 remains controversial. Machine learning techniques have been used effectively in combating the COVID-19 epidemic. However, researches related to machine learning on weather conditions in spreading COVID-19 is generally lacking. Therefore, in this study, three machine learning models (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), ADtree Classifier and BayesNet) based on the confirmed cases and weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are developed. This study aims to identify the best classification model to classify COVID-19 by using significant weather features chosen by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection method. The DS4C COVID-19 data set is used to train and validate each machine learning model. Several data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature selection have been conducted on the raw dataset to ensure the quality of the training data. The performance of these machine learning algorithms is further rectified based on the selected features set by PCA. Each classifier is then optimized using different tuning parameters to achieve optimum values before comparing the output of the three classifiers against each other. The observational results have shown that the optimized CNN classifier with seven weather variables selected by PCA achieved the highest performance among all the techniques. The experimental results obtained show that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the confirmed cases as compared to the other variables. Thus, from this result, it is evident that temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are important features for predicting COVID-19 confirmed cases.","2021","2022-06-13 21:23:27","2022-07-31 04:46:00","","305-320","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000640542700002","","","","","","","Machine learning; classification; deep learning; CNN; COVID-19; Naive Bayes; ADtree; B40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research proposes deep convolutional neural network based Inception V4 architecture approach for identifying weed density in soya bean crop fields using crop weed field image dataset (CFWID). This work uses RGB weed and crop images. It offers a data cleaning to eliminate background, and foreground vegetation using segmentation masked. Thereafter, the weed-density area is identified using vegetation segmentation, which is a major challenge in many of such research works. This approach is validated using the CFWID weed and crop dataset that consists of 1100 broadleaf, 2548 grass weed, and the remaining 736 weed images collected from soya bean crop fields and close-to-crop weeds.

In this paper Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm are combined and used to forecast short-term localized rainfall in tropical climate. State forecast (raining or not raining) and value forecast (rain intensity) are tested using a number of trained networks. Different types of ANN structured were trained with a combination of multilayer perceptron with back propagation network. Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization and Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm are used in the network training. Each neurons uses linear, logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid as transfer function. Input parameter preliminary analysis, data cleaning and FCM clustering were used to prepare input data for the ANN forecast model.

The predicted rainfall forecast for 1 to 6 h ahead are compared and analyzed. 1 h ahead for state and value forecast yield high accuracy.

Many new methods and new audio features are developed to improve the performance of MER algorithms. However, it is very difficult to compare the performance of the new methods because of the data representation diversity and scarcity of publicly available data. In this paper, we address these problems by creating a data set and a benchmark for MER. The data set that we release, a MediaEval Database for Emotional Analysis in Music (DEAM), is the largest available data set of dynamic annotations (valence and arousal annotations for 1,802 songs and song excerpts licensed under Creative Commons with 2Hz time resolution). Using DEAM, we organized the 'Emotion in Music'task at MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation Campaign from 2013 to 2015. The benchmark attracted, in total, 21 active teams to participate in the challenge. We analyze the results of the benchmark: the winning algorithms and feature-sets. We also describe the design of the benchmark, the evaluation procedures and the data cleaning and transformations that we suggest. The results from the benchmark suggest that the recurrent neural network based approaches combined with large feature-sets work best for dynamic MER.","2017-03-10","2022-06-13 21:23:28","2022-07-31 14:11:19","","","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000396091800035","","","","","","","PERCEIVED EMOTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record-including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers-to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms-Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB)-and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90 +/- 0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93 +/- 0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77 +/- 0.04 and average ROCAUC 0.81 +/- 0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings. Importantly, the best performing model had a false positive rate of 8%, as compared to rates of 20% or higher in previously reported studies. This artificial intelligence approach can help screen patients for whom an abuse concern exists and streamline the identification of patients who may benefit from referral to a child protection team. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to develop computer-aided-diagnosis platforms for the challenging and often intractable problem of reliably identifying pediatric patients suffering from physical abuse.","2021-02-26","2022-06-13 21:23:28","2022-07-30 22:42:06","","","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000624538400041","","","","","","","PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; RULE; VALIDATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, these fake jobs can be precisely detected and classified from a pool of job posts of both fake and real jobs by using advanced deep learning as well as machine learning classification algorithms. In this paper, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used so as to detect fake jobs and to differentiate them from real jobs.

It has to be noted that the data cleaning step is a very important step in machine learning project because it actually determines the accuracy of the machine learning as well as deep learning algorithms. Hence a great importance is emphasized on data cleaning and pre-processing step in this paper. The classification and detection of fake jobs can be done with high accuracy and high precision. Hence the machine learning and deep learning algorithms have to be applied on cleaned and pre-processed data in order to achieve a better accuracy.

The proposed method consists of four different layers, namely data acquisition, preprocessing, prediction, and performance evaluation. For experimental analysis, we have collected real data from four multi-storied residential building. The collected data are provided as input for the acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes were deployed to remove abnormalities from the data. In the prediction layer, we have used the deep extreme learning machine (DELM) for energy consumption prediction. Further, we have also used the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) in the prediction layer. In the DELM different numbers of hidden layers, different hidden neurons, and various types of activation functions have been used to achieve the optimal structure of DELM for energy consumption prediction. Similarly, in the ANN, we have employed a different combination of hidden neurons with different types of activation functions to get the optimal structure of ANN. To obtain the optimal structure of ANFIS, we have employed a different number and type of membership functions. In the performance evaluation layer for the comparative analysis of three prediction algorithms, we have used the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

The study utilized measured strains from an optimized sensor set deployed on a double track, steel, railway, truss bridge. Stringer-floor beam connection deterioration, a common deficiency, was the focus of this study; however, the proposed methodology could be used to assess the condition of a wide range of structural elements and details. The framework utilized Proper Orthogonal Modes (POMs) as damage features and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as an automated approach to infer damage location and intensity from the POMs. POM variations, which are traditionally input (load) dependent, were ultimately utilized as damage indicators. Input variability necessitated implementing ANNs to help decouple POM changes due to load variations from those caused by deficiencies, changes that would render the proposed framework input independent, a significant advancement. To develop an automated and efficient output-only damage detection framework, data cleansing and preparation were conducted prior to ANN training. Damage ""scenarios"" were artificially introduced into select output (strain) datasets recorded while monitoring train passes across the selected bridge. This information, in turn, was used to train ANNs using MATLABs Neural Net Toolbox. Trained ANNs were tested against monitored loading events and artificial damage scenarios. Applicability of the proposed, output-only framework was investigated via studies of the bridge under operational conditions. To account for the effects of potential deficiencies at the stringer-floor beam connections, measured signal amplitudes were artificially decreased at select locations. It was concluded that the proposed framework could successfully detect artificial deficiencies imposed on measured signals under operational conditions.","2018-11","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 14:51:41","","833-846","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000451093300009","","","","","","","Artificial neural networks; Data; Strain; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; Bridge; Cleansing; Damage; Detection; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Railway","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radar is an important data source used by operational meteorologists for issuing nowcasting warnings. With the main goal of helping meteorologists in analysing radar data for issuing nowcasting warnings, we propose NowDeepN, a supervised learning based regression model which uses an ensemble of deep artificial neural networks for predicting the values for radar products at a certain time moment. The values predicted by NowDeepN may be used by meteorologists in estimating the future development of potential severe phenomena and would replace the time consuming process of extrapolating the radar echoes. NowDeepN is intended to be a proof of concept for the effectiveness of learning from radar data relevant patterns that would be useful for predicting future values for radar products based on their historical values. For assessing the performance of NowDeepN, a set of experiments on real radar data provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration is conducted. The impact of a data cleaning step introduced for correcting the erroneous radar products' values is investigated both from the computational and meteorological perspectives. The experimental results also indicate the relevance of the features considered in the supervised learning task, highlighting that the radar products' values at a certain geographical location at a time moment may be predicted from the products' values from a neighboring area of that location at previous time moments. An overall Normalized Root Mean Squared Error less than 4% was obtained for NowDeepN on the cleaned radar data. Compared to similar related work from the nowcasting literature, NowDeepN outperforms several approaches and this emphasizes the performance of our proposal.","2021-01","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 03:04:42","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000605816600001","","","","","","","machine learning; MACHINE; IDENTIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; deep neural networks; Principal Component Analysis; autoencoders; TRACKING; weather nowcasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the current tobacco curing control technology has higher labor intensity, however, it also cannot be adjusted based on the conditions of different tobacco leaves batches reducing the quality of tobacco. The tobacco's quality can be improved after curing and labor intensity can be reduced by modeling the state prediction of the tobacco curing process, accurately predicting the state of the tobacco curing, and making timely adjustments to the curing process. The area, color, weight, and some chemical substances of tobacco leaves significantly change during the tobacco curing process. This can be theoretically used as the input feature of the state prediction model. However, it is difficult to calculate the changes of the area and the changes of chemical substances in real-time owing to the complexity of the intensive curing room environment. Only features such as color and weight are easier to extract indicating that the model has fewer available features, and the accuracy of prediction using a single model is relatively low. Considering this problem, a state prediction fusion model (SPFM) was proposed integrating Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). At the same time, based on the characteristics of the data set, a new data processing is proposed for the tobacco curing data set. By denoising, the image, the characteristic values of the RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space were extracted. Then, the data pre-processing such as standardization, data cleaning, and label digitization were performed on the data. Furthermore, an intelligent tobacco curing platform was designed to integrate data collection, online monitoring, data mining, and status prediction, and SPFM was embedded in the platform. A comparative test was conducted, based on the real data collected via a tobacco station in 2019. The results indicate that SPFM has a better performance compared to support vector machines, artificial neural network, and the base models of SPFM such as XGBoost and LSTM. The accuracy of SPFM is 0.974, with an increase of 4.8-59.7%; the macro recall of SPFM is 0.952, with an increase of 8.2%-49.9%; the macro recall of SPFM is 0.936, with an increase of 8.2-75.0%; and the macro F1-score of SPFM is 0.943, with an increase of 9.7-108.6%.","","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 04:38:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000640449200004","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-03129-5","Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Cleaning; Support vector machines; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Data mining; Tobacco; Curing; Color; NEURAL-NETWORKS; Extreme gradient boosting; Long-short term memory network; Model fusion; State prediction; Tobacco curing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maintenance is one of the important activities in the manufacturing process, and it requires proper attention. To decrease maintenance costs and to attain sustainable operational management, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) has become important in industries. The principle of PdM is forecasting the next failure; thus, the respective maintenance is scheduled before the predicted failure occurs. In the construction of maintenance management, facility managers generally employ reactive or preventive maintenance mechanisms. However, reactive maintenance does not have the ability to prevent failure and preventive maintenance does not have the ability to predict the future condition of mechanical, electrical, or plumbing components. Therefore, to improve the facilities' lifespans, such components are repaired in advance. In this paper, a PdM planning model is developed using intelligent methods. The developed method involves five main phases: (a) data cleaning, (b) data normalization, (c) optimal feature selection, (d) prediction network decision-making, and (e) prediction. Initially, the data pertaining to PdM are subjected to data cleaning and normalization in order to arrange the data within a particular limit. Optimal feature selection is performed next, to reduce redundant information. Optimal feature selection is performed using a hybrid of the Jaya algorithm and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). As the prediction values differ in range, it is difficult for machine learning or deep learning face to provide accurate results. Thus, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to make decisions regarding the prediction network. The SVM identifies the network in which prediction can be performed for the concerned range. Finally, the prediction is accomplished using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In the RNN, the weight is optimized using the hybrid J-SLnO. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can efficiently predict the future condition of components for maintenance planning by using two datasets-aircraft engine and lithium-ion battery datasets.","2022-03","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 04:45:21","","","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000774448000001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063387","learning (artificial intelligence); decision making; production engineering computing; recurrent neural nets; optimisation; support vector machines; maintenance engineering; machine learning; recurrent neural network; support vector machine; preventive maintenance; sustainable development; OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK; 0; industry 4; Jaya-based sea lion optimization; predictive maintenance planning; sustainable manufacturing; SYSTEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, a number of studies have shown that convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used to classify aurora images with high accuracy. We analyzed aurora images and found that there is a certain amount of mislabeled data in aurora datasets. As this labeling error causes the difficulty in judging the shape of aurora, it is important for aurora image classification to assign accurate labels to aurora images. However, the shape of aurora is ambiguous and it is very difficult to label the aurora image accurately. We think that these mislabeled data are hindering aurora image analysis. In this study, we propose a classification method and a CNN training method that reduces the effect of mislabeled data. Specifically, we used Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) for aurora image classification instead of a final layer of a pre-trained CNN model. In addition, we propose a simple method for determining mislabeled data. Using a combination of these two methods to automatically classify aurora images, we achieved an F1 score of 0.945 for an aurora image dataset with four labels: arc aurora, drapery, hot-spot and radial, an improvement of 0.2 over traditional CNN-based classification.","2021","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 15:39:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000767230602032","","","","","","","Cleaning; Training; Prediction algorithms; Training data; image classification; Convolutional neural network; label cleaning; k-nearest neighbor; Ion radiation effects; Nearest neighbor methods; Shape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IECON 2021 - 47TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A protein exhibits its true nature after binding to its interacting molecule known as a ligand that binds only in the favorable binding site of the protein structure. Different computational methods exploiting the features of proteins have been developed to identify the binding sites in the protein structure, but none seems to provide promising results, and therefore, further investigation is required. Results In this study, we present a deep learning model PUResNet and a novel data cleaning process based on structural similarity for predicting protein-ligand binding sites. From the whole scPDB (an annotated database of druggable binding sites extracted from the Protein DataBank) database, 5020 protein structures were selected to address this problem, which were used to train PUResNet.

However, the overwhelming majority of current performance prediction models based on neural networks are deterministic. Therefore, this study combined Bayesian theory and neural networks to establish a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based probabilistic model for predicting pavement deterioration. The proposed model was built on the pavement data in Shanxi Province, China. This study first refined data using the K-Nearest Neighbour and empirical methods, and then selected input features based on correlation coefficient methods. Using the refined data, the deterministic neural network model was established to obtain the prior probability distribution of weights, and then the BNN-based probabilistic model was developed. Compared with the sole neural network model, the BNN-based model not only retains comparable prediction accuracy to the neural network model, but also incorporates uncertainties. The BNN-based model is also theoretically superior to the Markov-based probabilistic model because the former can incorporate all factors and does not need to classify performance values into states. The BNN-based model shall provide more reliable prediction results of pavement deterioration and help engineers make more reasonable maintenance decisions.","","2022-06-13 21:23:30","2022-07-31 13:55:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000803978700001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10298436.2022.2076854","Deterioration; Neural networks; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Nearest neighbor search; Bayesian networks; Correlation methods; data cleaning; Pavements; RULES; Bayesian neural network; CRASHES; Pavement deterioration; prediction; probabilistic model; UNCERTAINTY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aiming at the problems of abnormal and missing historical data of collected photovoltaic power generation data, this paper takes the light intensity curve and the power curve of adjacent photovoltaic power plants as input references, and proposes a neural network for identifying and reconstructing abnormal photovoltaic power generation data based on geographical location Network model. After analyzing the correlation of each reference quantity, pre-process and normalize the selected light intensity data and neighboring power station data respectively. For missing data, use nnz function to identify. For singular data, a curve similarity function is constructed, and the function values are clustered to be identified by contour coefficients. The sample data point set of [0.5,1] is used as the training set.

Accurate precipitation estimation is thus highly non-trivial. Today's technical capability, automated data measuring (whether using Radar or automatic meteorological stations), as well as subsequent large-scale data processing and regression model training, allow the meteorological estimations and predictions with increasing accuracy.

Traditional quality control methods based on existing knowledge may be inefficient because of our limited understanding regarding the interaction of human activities and stochastic environmental factors. Moreover, traditional methods for outlier detection may be misleading because of the existence of valid outliers and invalid inliers. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are developed to identify instrument failure based on current and historical observations. Two structures, i.e., multilayer perceptrons and recurrent networks, are trained using 50,000 hourly data points labeled by human reviewers. The most conservative model identified 57.5% of the invalid sulfur compound observations and 44.9% of the invalid nitrogen compound observations. By setting a more liberal threshold, these values increased to 76.0% and 79.7%, respectively. Except for SO2, the ANNs outperformed the traditional methods for data quality control, as demonstrated with a plausibility test, a test of temporal consistency and a residential analysis. Compared with the test of temporal consistency, which was the most effective traditional method studied, the true positive rates of the ANNs were 19.4% to 29.5% higher for all pollutants except SO2, given the same false positive rates. The results indicate the effectiveness of ANNs for data quality control even without supplementary information. Methods for performance improvement are discussed.","2019-10","2022-06-13 21:23:31","2022-07-31 15:19:56","","1189-1196","","10","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000508374200006","","","","","","","Data cleaning; Multilayer perceptrons; PREDICTION; MODEL; POLLUTION; AREA; Automatic monitoring; Data auditing; Recurrent neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine-learning-based computational approaches have been broadly utilized and demonstrated to be useful for PPI prediction. However, directly applying traditional machine learning algorithms, which often assume that samples in different classes are balanced, often leads to poor performance because of the severe class imbalance that exists in the PPI prediction problem. In this study, we propose a novel method for improving PPI prediction performance by relieving the severity of class imbalance using a data-cleaning procedure and reducing predicted false positives with a post-filtering procedure: First, a machine-learning-based data-cleaning procedure is applied to remove those marginal targets, which may potentially have a negative effect on training a model with a clear classification boundary, from the majority samples to relieve the severity of class imbalance in the original training dataset; then, a prediction model is trained on the cleaned dataset; finally, an effective post-filtering procedure is further used to reduce potential false positive predictions. Stringent cross-validation and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method, which exhibits highly competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art sequence-based PPIs predictors and should supplement existing PPI prediction methods.","2016-04","2022-06-13 21:23:31","2022-07-31 04:40:33","","141-153","","1-2","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000375553500018","","","","","","","Random forests; Data cleaning; OPTIMIZATION; BIOINFORMATICS; IDENTIFICATION; Imbalanced learning; K-TUPLE; MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFIER; Post-filtering; PROFILE; Protein-protein interaction sites; PSI-BLAST; RESIDUES; SEQUENCE-BASED PREDICTOR; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, based on the deep belief network (DBN) learning and analyzing the data feature set, in order to realize the prediction of the diffusion trend of air pollutants.

However, little attention has been paid to discuss how the input data quality impacts the result. Indeed, some review-rating pairs that a user gave to an item are inconsistent and express a different opinion, making the recommendation result biased. To solve the above drawback, this study proposes a two-phase deep learning-based recommender system. Firstly, a sentiment predictor of textual reviews is created, serving as the quality inspector that cleans and improves the input for a recommender. To build accurate predictors, this phase tries and compares a set of deep learning-based algorithms. Secondly, besides only exploiting the consistent review-rating pairs generated by the quality inspector, this phase builds deep learning-based recommender engines. The experiments on a real-world dataset showed the proposed data quality inspector, based on textual reviews, improves the overall performance of recommenders. On average, applying deep learning-based quality inspectors result in an above 6% improvement in RMSE, and more than a 2% boost in F1 score, and accuracy. This is robust evidence to prove the importance of the input data cleaning process in this field. Moreover, empirical evidence indicates the deep learning approach is suitable for modeling the sentiment predictor, and the core recommendation process, clearly outperforming the traditional machine learning methods.</p>","2021-10","2022-06-13 21:23:32","2022-07-31 01:45:04","","","","20","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000716032900001","","","","","","","deep learning; data quality; text classification; collaborative filtering; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; recommendation system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modifications made during manual data cleaning may affect nutrient intakes. Objectives: We evaluated the effects of modifications made during manual data cleaning on nutrient intakes of interest: energy, carbohydrate, total fat, protein, and fiber. Methods: Differences in mean intake before and after data cleaning modifications for all recalls and average intakes per subject were analyzed by paired t-tests. The Chi-squared test was used to determine whether unsupervised recalls had more open-ended text responses that required modification than supervised recalls. We characterized food types of text response modifications. Correlations between predictive energy requirements, measured total energy expenditure (TEE), and mean energy intake from raw and modified data were examined. Results: After excluding 11 recalls with invalidating technical errors, 1499 valid recalls completed by 393 subjects were included in this analysis. We found significant differences before and after modifications for energy, carbohydrate, total fat, and protein intakes for all recalls (P < 0.05). Limiting to modified recalls, there were significant differences for all nutrients of interest, including fiber (P < 0.02). There was not a significantly greater proportion of text responses requiring modification for home compared with supervised recalls (P = 0.271). Predicted energy requirements correlated highly with TEE. There was no significant difference in correlation of mean energy intake with TEE for modified compared with raw data. Mean intake for individual subjects was significantly different for energy, protein, and fat intakes following cleaning modifications (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Manual modifications can change mean nutrient intakes for an entire cohort and individuals. However, modifications did not significantly affect the correlation of energy intake with predictive requirements and measured expenditure. Investigators can consider their research question and nutrients of interest when deciding to make cleaning modifications.","2021-03","2022-06-13 21:23:32","2022-07-31 14:04:24","","","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000637033400001","","","","","","","data cleaning; 24-hour recall; ASA24; dietary assessment; RECALL; total energy expenditure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We introduce GEDet, a few-shot learning based framework to detect erroneous nodes in graphs. GEDet consists of two novel components, each addresses a unique challenge. (1) To cope with the lack of examples, we introduce a graph augmentation module to enrich training labels. The module not only generates additional synthetic training labels by simulating different erroneous scenarios, but also exploits non-local relations to enrich neighborhood information. (2) To further improve the accuracy, we introduce an adversarially learned module that can better detect erroneous nodes by distinguishing nodes with synthetic and real labels encoded by graph autoencoders. Unlike conventional error detection models, GEDet yields effective classifiers that are optimized for a few yet diversified examples in the presence of multiple error scenarios. We show that using only a small number of examples, GEDet significantly improves the competing methods such as constraint based detection and anomaly detection, with a gain of 35% on recall, and 30% on precision.","2020","2022-06-13 21:23:34","2022-07-31 13:39:02","","44-53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000662554700015","","","","","","","Anomaly detection; Generative adversarial networks; Big Data; data cleaning; Training; Conferences; adversarial deep learning; ERROR; few-shot learning; graphs","","Wu, XT; Jermaine, C; Xiong, L; Hu, XH; Kotevska, O; Lu, SY; Xu, WJ; Aluru, S; Zhai, CX; Al-Masri, E; Chen, ZY; Saltz, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research shows that under the condition of limited resources, the performance of NMT is greatly reduced, and a large amount of high-quality bilingual parallel data is needed to train a competitive translation model. However, not all languages have large-scale and high-quality bilingual corpus resources available. In these cases, improving the quality of the corpora has become the main focus to increase the accuracy of the NMT results. This paper proposes a new method to improve the quality of data by using data cleaning, data expansion, and other measures to expand the data at the word and sentence-level, thus improving the richness of the bilingual data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) language model is also used to ensure the smoothness of sentence construction in the process of sentence construction. At the same time, it uses a variety of processing methods to improve the quality of the bilingual data. Experiments using three standard test sets are conducted to validate the proposed method; the most advanced fairseq-transformer NMT system is used in the training. The results show that the proposed method has worked well on improving the translation results. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the BLEU value of our method is increased by 2.34 compared with that of the baseline.","2020","2022-06-13 21:23:34","2022-07-31 14:34:12","","637-650","","1","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000535726900036","","","","","","","data cleaning; deep learning; MODEL; corpus argumentation; model improvement; Neural machine translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An organized EHR can greatly help doctors treat patients. In some cases, only limited patient information is collected to help doctors make treatment decisions. Because EHRs can serve as a reference for this limited information, doctors' treatment capabilities can be enhanced. Natural language processing and deep learning methods can help organize and translate EHR information into medical knowledge and experience. Objective: In this study, we aimed to create a model to extract concept embeddings from EHRs for disease pattern retrieval and further classification tasks. Methods: We collected 1,040,989 emergency department visits from the National Taiwan University Hospital Integrated Medical Database and 305,897 samples from the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department data. After data cleansing and preprocessing, the data sets were divided into training, validation, and test sets. We proposed a Transformer-based model to embed EHRs and used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract features from free text and concatenate features with structural data as input to our proposed model. Then, Deep InfoMax (DIM) and Simple Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) were used for the unsupervised embedding of the disease concept. The pretrained disease concept-embedding model, named EDisease, was further finetuned to adapt to the critical care outcome prediction task. We evaluated the performance of embedding using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to perform dimension reduction for visualization The performance of the finetuned predictive model was evaluated against published models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). Results: The performance of our model on the outcome prediction had the highest AUROC of 0.876. In the ablation study, the use of a smaller data set or fewer unsupervised methods for pretraining deteriorated the prediction performance. The AUROCs were 0.857, 0.870, and 0.868 for the model without pretraining, the model pretrained by only SimCLR, and the model pretrained by only DIM, respectively. On the smaller finetuning set, the AUROC was 0.815 for the proposed model. Conclusions: Through contrastive learning methods, disease concepts can be embedded meaningfully. Moreover, these methods can be used for disease retrieval tasks to enhance clinical practice capabilities. The disease concept model is also suitable as a pretrained model for subsequent prediction tasks.","2021-01-27","2022-06-13 21:23:35","2022-07-31 14:08:24","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000612202400004","","","","","","","natural language processing; machine learning; deep learning; electronic health record; NLP; concept; disease embedding; disease retrieval; EHR; emergency department; extraction; LONG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It plays an important role in traffic information service and traffic guidance. However, complex traffic systems are highly nonlinear and stochastic, making short-term traffic flow prediction a challenging issue. Although long short-term memory (LSTM) has a good performance in traffic flow prediction, the impact of temporal features on prediction has not been exploited by existing studies. In this paper, a temporal information enhancing LSTM (T-LSTM) is proposed to predict traffic flow of a single road section. In view of the similar characteristics of traffic flow at the same time each day, the model can improve prediction accuracy by capturing the intrinsic correlation between traffic flow and temporal information. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the prediction performance and obtain higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel missing data processing technique based on T-LSTM. According to the experimental results, this technique can well restore the characteristics of original data and improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction.","2019","2022-06-13 21:23:36","2022-07-31 04:09:16","","98053-98060","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000480325200001","","","","","","","Recurrent neural networks; LSTM; deep learning; Computational modeling; Data models; Predictive models; Autoregressive processes; Market research; SYSTEMS; MODELS; DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS; missing data repair; temporal features; Traffic flow prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most common milk adulterants are (a) soda, (b) urea, (c) water and (d) detergents. The main contribution of this paper is to build a mathematical model to enable quantifying the degree of common adulterants present in milk. Data was collected using a portable spectroradiometer (Eko MS-720) which measures the spectral irradiance in the range from visible to near-infrared irradiance (350 nm 1050 nm) using samples of milk contaminated with four different adulterants (soda, urea, water and detergent) with known degree of contamination deliberately added in milk. In this study, we used the data in the range of 350 - 1050 nm to identify spectral signatures of different adulterants with different degree of concentration. Data cleansing, in the form of pre-processing was followed by machine learning techniques to create a model to capture the adulterants and also the degree of adulteration. Linear regression along with wrapper subset eval as attribute evaluator and best first search as search option was found to create the best model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient (CC) metrics were used to select the best model. The best model for detecting the degree of adulteration due to soda, urea, water and detergent in milk was found to have an RMSE of 0.027, 0.0069, 0.0382 and 0.0281 respectively while CC was 0.9919, 0.9997, 0.9887 and 0.9938 respectively.

The 2019 Indonesian presidential election was very tense in terms of the candidates' campaigns in cyberspace, especially on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, etc. The Indonesian people used social media platforms to express their positive, neutral, and also negative opinions on the respective presidential candidates. The campaigning of respective social media users on their choice of candidates for regents, governors, and legislative positions up to presidential candidates was conducted via the Internet and online media. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to conduct sentiment analysis on the candidates in the 2019 Indonesia presidential election based on Twitter datasets. The study used datasets on the opinions expressed by the Indonesian people available on Twitter with the hashtags (#) containing ""Jokowi and Prabowo."" We conducted data pre-processing using a selection of comments, data cleansing, text parsing, sentence normalization and tokenization based on the given text in the Indonesian language, determination of class attributes, and, finally, we classified the Twitter posts with the hashtags (#) using Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve an optimal and maximum optimization accuracy. The study provides benefits in terms of helping the community to research opinions on Twitter that contain positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

Series of characteristic values of speed, travel distance, and direction are calculated, which reflect the travel mode of smartphone holders. In travel mode identification, first, the transition regions of travel segments of different travel modes are effectively distinguished; then, continuous tracking points for single-mode travel are connected into single-mode travel segments. The travel mode of the surveyed subjects is identified based on the calculated features of average speed, average acceleration, and average change of direction within each single-mode segment. The random forest method is chosen as the basis model to classify travel mode. Three-quarters of the travel records were used to construct the random forest classifier, and the detection accuracy of the established model for the remaining 1/4 of the travel record reached 94.4%.

Accurate and early risk detection will provide more information for early management and better decision making. This study aimed to build prediction models using patients' characteristics, laboratory data, and comorbidities for early detection of acute respiratory failure, ventilator dependence, and mortality in patients with COPD after hospitalization.

It is possible to automatically diagnose and, in some cases, predict the failures of track circuits by performing analytics on the track signals. In order to perform these analytics, we need to study the coded signals transmitted to and received from the track. However, these signals consist of heterogeneous pulses that are noisy for data analysis. Thus, we need techniques which will automatically group homogeneous pulses into similar groups. In this paper, we present data cleansing techniques which will cluster pulses based on digital analysis and machine learning. We report the results of our evaluation of clustering algorithms that improve the quality of analytic data. The data were captured under revenue service conditions operated by Alstom. For clustering algorithm, we used the kappa-means algorithm to cluster heterogeneous pulses.

Material and methods: A cohort of 153 head-and-neck cancer patients was used to model xerostomia at 0-6 months (early), 6-15 months (late), 15-24 months (long-term), and at any time (a longitudinal model) after radiotherapy. Predictive power of the features was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of univariate logistic regression models. The multivariate NTCP models were tuned and tested with single and nested cross-validation, respectively. We compared predictive performance of seven classification algorithms, six feature selection methods, and ten data cleaning/class balancing techniques using the Friedman test and the Nemenyi post hoc analysis. Results: NTCP models based on the parotid mean dose failed to predict xerostomia (AUCs < 0.60). The most informative predictors were found for late and long-term xerostomia. Late xerostomia correlated with the contralateral dose gradient in the anterior posterior (AUC = 0.72) and the right left (AUC = 0.68) direction, whereas long-term xerostomia was associated with parotid volumes (AUCs > 0.85), dose gradients in the right left (AUCs > 0.78), and the anterior posterior (AUCs > 0.72) direction. Multivariate models of long-term xerostomia were typically based on the parotid volume, the parotid eccentricity, and the dose volume histogram (DVH) spread with the generalization AUCs ranging from 0.74 to 0.88. On average, support vector machines and extra-trees were the top performing classifiers, whereas the algorithms based on logistic regression were the best choice for feature selection. We found no advantage in using data cleaning or class balancing methods. Conclusion: We demonstrated that incorporation of organ- and dose-shape descriptors is beneficial for xerostomia prediction in highly conformal radiotherapy treatments. Due to strong reliance on patient-specific, dose-independent factors, our results underscore the need for development of personalized data-driven risk profiles for NTCP models of xerostomia. The facilitated machine learning pipeline is described in detail and can serve as a valuable reference for future work in radiomic and dosiomic NTCP modeling.","2018-03-05","2022-06-13 21:23:37","2022-07-31 14:15:57","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000426682500001","","","","","","","machine learning; PREDICTION; AREA; dosiomics; HEAD; head and neck; IMPROVE; IMRT; IRRADIATION; NTCP; PAROTID-GLAND; radiomics; radiotherapy; RADIOTHERAPY; SALIVARY-GLANDS; VOLUME; xerostomia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The industrial sensor-cloud system (SCS) has also received widespread attention. In the future, a large number of integrated sensors that simultaneously collect multifeature data will be added to industrial SCS. However, the collected big data are not trustworthy due to the harsh environment of the sensor. If the data collected at the bottom networks are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, the query and data mining results will be inaccurate, which will seriously affect the judgment and feedback of the cloud. The traditional method of relying on sensor nodes for data cleaning is insufficient to deal with big data, whereas edge computing provides a good solution. In this article, a new data cleaning method is proposed based on the mobile edge node during data collection. An angle-based outlier detection method is applied at the edge node to obtain the training data of the cleaning model, which is then established through support vector machine. Besides, online learning is adopted for model optimization. Experimental results show that multidimensional data cleaning based on mobile edge nodes improves the efficiency of data cleaning while maintaining data reliability and integrity, and greatly reduces the bandwidth and energy consumption of the industrial SCS.","2020-02","2022-06-13 21:23:37","2022-07-31 14:44:47","","1321-1329","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000521337000057","","","","","","","Cleaning; Cloud computing; Wireless sensor networks; Edge computing; Data cleaning; edge computing; Computational modeling; Data models; Sensors; BLOCKCHAIN; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); industrial sensor-cloud; online machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But so far only a few investigative stories have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods, and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a particular story, which means that training data is not readily available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts ""newsworthy"" are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.","2019-09-14","2022-06-13 21:23:37","2022-07-31 05:24:08","","1076-1097","","8","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000473633800002","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; machine learning; data cleaning; algorithmic news; computational journalism; investigative journalism; natural-language processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients'symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. Objective: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. Methods: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. Results: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F-1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F-1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. Conclusions: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.","2021-05-06","2022-06-13 21:23:37","2022-07-31 03:17:44","","","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000648448400007","","","","","","","natural language processing; machine learning; deep learning; COVID-19; artificial intelligence; chatbot; deployment; development; medical specialty; recommendation; smartphone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, natural population-based screening projects require a large number of resources. With the emergence and development of machine learning, researchers have started to pursue more flexible and efficient methods to screen or predict type 2 diabetes. Objective: The aim of this study was to build prediction models based on the ensemble learning method for diabetes screening to further improve the health status of the population in a noninvasive and inexpensive manner. Methods: The dataset for building and evaluating the diabetes prediction model was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011-2016. After data cleaning and feature selection, the dataset was split into a training set (80%, 2011-2014), test set (20%, 2011-2014) and validation set (2015-2016). Three simple machine learning methods (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest) and easy ensemble methods were used to build diabetes prediction models. The performance of the models was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. The Delong test (2-sided) was used to test the performance differences between the models. Results: We selected 8057 observations and 12 attributes from the database. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the three simple methods yielded highly predictive performance models with areas under the curve (AUCs) over 0.800, wherein the ensemble methods significantly outperformed the simple methods. When we evaluated the models in the test set and validation set, the same trends were observed. The ensemble model of linear discriminant analysis yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.849, an accuracy of 0.730, a sensitivity of 0.819, and a specificity of 0.709 in the validation set. Conclusions: This study indicates that efficient screening using machine learning methods with noninvasive tests can be applied to a large population and achieve the objective of secondary prevention.","2020-06","2022-06-13 21:23:38","2022-07-31 13:58:23","","","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000546388900003","","","","","","","machine learning; RISK; HEALTH; ADULTS; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; non-invasive attributes; POPULATION; screening; type 2 diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated a generalizable approach to aid clinical evaluation of depression and remission from voice using transfer learning: We train machine learning models on easily accessible non-clinical datasets and test them on novel clinical data in a different language. Methods A Mixture of Experts machine learning model was trained to infer happy/sad emotional state using three publicly available emotional speech corpora in German and US English. We examined the model's predictive ability to classify the presence of depression on Danish speaking healthy controls (N = 42), patients with first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD) (N = 40), and the subset of the same patients who entered remission (N = 25) based on recorded clinical interviews. The model was evaluated on raw, de-noised, and speaker-diarized data. Results The model showed separation between healthy controls and depressed patients at the first visit, obtaining an AUC of 0.71. Further, speech from patients in remission was indistinguishable from that of the control group. Model predictions were stable throughout the interview, suggesting that 20-30 s of speech might be enough to accurately screen a patient. Background noise (but not speaker diarization) heavily impacted predictions. Conclusion A generalizable speech emotion recognition model can effectively reveal changes in speaker depressive states before and after remission in patients with MDD.

However, some studies suggest that the poor accuracy of solubility prediction is not related to the quality of the experimental data and that more precise methodologies (algorithms and/or set of descriptors) are required for predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules. In this study a large and diverse database was generated with aqueous solubility values collected from two public sources; two new recursive machine-learning approaches were developed for data cleaning and variable selection, and a consensus model based on regression and classification algorithms was created. The modeling protocol, which includes the curation of chemical and experimental data, was implemented in KNIME, with the aim of obtaining an automated workflow for the prediction of new databases.

Widespread application of PMU produces a vast amount of time-synchronized historical operating data, making it possible to turn to machine learning approaches to detect the attacks. However, anomalous events occur rarely in practice. To construct a balanced training dataset, where normal and anomalous instances need to be evenly extracted and labeled from historical operating records, is sure to cost plenty of human efforts and may introduce uncontrollable experience errors. In this paper, we design a novel detection model with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) based data augmentation and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)based data cleaning technique to reconstruct the imbalanced training dataset into a balanced one to train the subsequent XGBoost classifier. Experiments show that although rare anomalous historical event records are needed, our model is still able to effectively detect out DMAs in power systems.","2017","2022-06-13 21:23:38","2022-07-31 05:41:50","","373-378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000427701300069","","","","","","","XGBoost; cyber-physical security; data manipulation attack detection; imbalanced classification; SMOTE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON ENERGY INTERNET AND ENERGY SYSTEM INTEGRATION (EI2)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the associated costs and morbidity of unkept appointments, this is an issue requiring urgent attention. We aimed to determine rates of unkept outpatient clinic appointments across hospital trusts in the England. In addition, we aimed to examine the predictors of unkept outpatient clinic appointments across specialties at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHT). Our final aim was to train machine learning models to determine the effectiveness of a potential intervention in reducing unkept appointments. Methods and findings UK Hospital Episode Statistics outpatient data from 2016 to 2018 were used for this study. Machine learning models were trained to determine predictors of unkept appointments and their relative importance. These models were gradient boosting machines. In 2017-2018 there were approximately 85 million outpatient appointments, with an unkept appointment rate of 5.7%. Within ICHT, there were almost 1 million appointments, with an unkept appointment rate of 11.2%. Hepatology had the highest rate of unkept appointments (17%), and medical oncology had the lowest (6%). The most important predictors of unkept appointments included the recency (25%) and frequency (13%) of previous unkept appointments and age at appointment (10%). A sensitivity of 0.287 was calculated overall for specialties with at least 10,000 appointments in 2016-2017 (after data cleaning). This suggests that 28.7% of patients who do miss their appointment would be successfully targeted if the top 10% least likely to attend received an intervention. As a result, an intervention targeting the top 10% of likely non-attenders, in the full population of patients, would be able to capture 28.7% of unkept appointments if successful. Study limitations include that some unkept appointments may have been missed from the analysis because recording of unkept appointments is not mandatory in England. Furthermore, results here are based on a single trust in England, hence may not be generalisable to other locations. Conclusions Unkept appointments remain an ongoing concern for healthcare systems internationally. Using machine learning, we can identify those most likely to miss their appointment and implement more targeted interventions to reduce unkept appointment rates.","2021-10","2022-06-13 21:23:38","2022-07-31 14:39:19","","","","10","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000750871900005","","","","","","","MISSED APPOINTMENTS; NO-SHOW; NON-ATTENDANCE; PRIMARY-CARE; REASONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, e-commerce and wildlife trading websites can contain a vast number of advertisements, an unknown proportion of which may be irrelevant to researchers and practitioners. Given that many wildlife-trade advertisements have an unstructured text format, automated identification of relevant listings has not traditionally been possible, nor attempted. Other scientific disciplines have solved similar problems using machine learning and natural language processing models, such as text classifiers. Here, we test the ability of a suite of text classifiers to extract relevant advertisements from wildlife trade occurring on the Internet. We collected data from an Australian classifieds website where people can post advertisements of their pet birds (n = 16.5k advertisements). We found that text classifiers can predict, with a high degree of accuracy, which listings are relevant (ROC AUC >= 0.98, F1 score >= 0.77). Furthermore, in an attempt to answer the question 'how much data is required to have an adequately performing model?', we conducted a sensitivity analysis by simulating decreases in sample sizes to measure the subsequent change in model performance. From our sensitivity analysis, we found that text classifiers required a minimum sample size of 33% (c. 5.5k listings) to accurately identify relevant listings (for our dataset), providing a reference point for future applications of this sort. Our results suggest that text classification is a viable tool that can be applied to the online trade of wildlife to reduce time dedicated to data cleaning. However, the success of text classifiers will vary depending on the advertisements and websites, and will therefore be context dependent. Further work to integrate other machine learning tools, such as image classification, may provide better predictive abilities in the context of streamlining data processing for wildlife trade related online data.","2021-07-09","2022-06-13 21:23:38","2022-07-31 04:05:17","","","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000674301400084","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complexity of the task stems not just from the macroevolutionary and macroecological challenge of modeling so many species, but also from the difficulty in collecting and quantifying birdsong itself. Using machine learning techniques, we extracted songs from a large citizen science dataset, and then analyzed the evolution, and biotic and abiotic predictors of variation in birdsong across 578 passerine species. Contrary to expectations, we found few links between life-history traits (monogamy and sexual dimorphism) and the evolution of song pitch (peak frequency) or song complexity (standard deviation of frequency). However, we found significant support for morphological constraints on birdsong, as reflected in a negative correlation between bird size and song pitch. We also found that broad-scale biogeographical and climate factors such as net primary productivity, temperature, and regional species richness were significantly associated with both the evolution and present-day distribution of bird song features.

Clustering is a technique which is used to grouping the objects which is having similar characters. In existing system, K-Means clustering is used to cluster the numerical data but it does not cluster the categorical data. To overcome the limitation of using numeric data only in the clustering process, F Jiang proposed the initialization method for K-modes clustering in which the initial cluster centres were calculated using Ini_Distance and Ini_Entropy methods were used. To improve the performance further, a new modified model is proposed for Fuzzy K-modes clustering. In this model, a modified Initial_Distance and Initial_Entropy Initialization method are used. It ensures that K initial cluster centers are not selected from the same cluster and selected initial cluster centers are not outliers. Also, one of a data pre-processing methods-Data cleaning is used to increase the quality of clustering results and a new modified weight matching distance (WMD) is calculated by using distance between two objects at the time initialization. An experiment result is demonstrated with five data sets taken from UCI machine learning repository and the results proved the effectiveness of the initialization method.","2017","2022-06-13 21:23:39","2022-07-30 22:40:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000428309500054","","","","","","","Fuzzy K-Modes clustering; Initial cluster center; Initial_Distance; Initial_Entropy; Outlier Detection Technique; MEANS ALGORITHM; SETS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TECHNIQUES IN CONTROL, OPTIMIZATION AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (INCOS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remote sensing that holds detailed and abundant information on spectral, textual, contextual, and spatial configurations is crucial to obtaining land use maps that reveal changes in the urban environment. However, social sensing is essential to revealing the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of urban land use. This data mining approach is related to data cleaning/outlier removal and machine learning, and is used to achieve land use classification from remote and social sensing data. In bicycle and taxi density maps, the daytime destination and nighttime origin density reflects work-related land uses, including commercial and industrial areas. By contrast, the nighttime destination and daytime origin density pattern captures the pattern of residential areas. The accuracy assessment of land use classified maps shows that the integration of remote and social sensing, using the decision tree and random forest methods, yields accuracies of 83% and 86%, respectively. Thus, this approach facilitates an accurate urban land use classification. Urban land use identification can aid policy makers in linking human activities to the socioeconomic consequences of different urban land uses.","2020-09","2022-06-13 21:23:39","2022-07-31 14:54:09","","","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000581481000001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9090550","learning (artificial intelligence); data mining; decision trees; random forest; town and country planning; remote sensing; behavioural sciences computing; demography; land use planning; socio-economic effects; terrain mapping; decision tree; AREA; accuracy assessment; COVER; human behavior; OPENSTREETMAP; social sensing; urban land use map; USE CLASSIFICATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents one approach to clean a large noisy visual tracking dataset to allow extracting statistically sound results from the image data. In particular, analyses of 3.6 million underwater trajectories of a fish with the water temperature at the time of acquisition are presented. Although there are many false detections and incorrect trajectory assignments, by a combination of data binning and robust estimation methods, reliable evidence for an increase in fish speed as water temperature increases are demonstrated. Then, a method for data cleaning which removes outliers arising from false detections and incorrect trajectory assignments using a deep learning-based clustering algorithm is proposed. The corresponding results show a rise in fish speed as temperature goes up. Several statistical tests applied to both cleaned and not-cleaned data confirm that both results are statistically significant and show an increasing trend.

Due to the existence of non-palpable nodules it is very hard to detect the structural changes of thyroid disease by assessing the thyroid functional changes. For instance at structural level ""Euthyroid"" is normal thyroid hormonal functional state but this would be involved in initial structural changes such as goiter, cold nodule, MNG (multiple nodule goiter) and cancer (Grave's Disease and so on). The ideal system should not only identify all the thyroid disease types but also recommend state of structural levels; otherwise it would be converted into serious disease, such like cancer. In-order to mitigate such problems, this paper proposes a framework TDTD (Thyroid Disease Types Diagnostics) that aims to assist the physicians during the diagnostic process of thyroid diseases in a very structured and transparent manner. Proposed system TDTD presents a novel method MDC (Medical data cleaning) for filling of missing values in medical datasets by building classifier based upon the Bayesian isotonic regression algorithm because missing values of medical data (i.e. blood tests) are different in nature and they could not be filled with normal procedures. In second phase two classifiers are trained to classify the functional and structural levels of thyroid disease at granular level using multi and binary SVM (support vector machine) algorithms, in final phase performance and evaluation is approximated using confusion matrix, precision and recall measures.","2016","2022-06-13 21:23:40","2022-07-31 15:35:50","","44-50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000386368400009","","","","","","","machine learning; missing values; Datamining; goiters; thyroid hormone; SYSTEM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (ICISE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many low and middle-income countries, TB remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Once a patient has been diagnosed with TB, it is critical that healthcare workers make the most appropriate treatment decision given the individual conditions of the patient and the likely course of the disease based on medical experience. Depending on the prognosis, delayed or inappropriate treatment can result in unsatisfactory results including the exacerbation of clinical symptoms, poor quality of life, and increased risk of death. This work benchmarks machine learning models to aid TB prognosis using a Brazilian health database of confirmed cases and deaths related to TB in the State of Amazonas. The goal is to predict the probability of death by TB thus aiding the prognosis of TB and associated treatment decision making process. In its original form, the data set comprised 36,228 records and 130 fields but suffered from missing, incomplete, or incorrect data. Following data cleaning and preprocessing, a revised data set was generated comprising 24,015 records and 38 fields, including 22,876 reported cured TB patients and 1139 deaths by TB. To explore how the data imbalance impacts model performance, two controlled experiments were designed using (1) imbalanced and (2) balanced data sets. The best result is achieved by the Gradient Boosting (GB) model using the balanced data set to predict TB-mortality, and the ensemble model composed by the Random Forest (RF), GB and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models is the best model to predict the cure class.","2021-06","2022-06-13 21:23:40","2022-07-31 14:45:41","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000665146300001","","","","","","","feature selection; machine learning; ensemble model; RISK; CLASSIFICATION; SCORE; VALIDATION; benchmark; DEATH; EVOLUTIONARY; imbalanced data sets; INFECTIONS; neglected tropical disease; prognosis; random search; tuberculosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.","2019","2022-06-13 21:23:40","2022-07-31 15:38:01","","238-241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000469779800038","","","","","","","label noise; outlier detection; reconstruction error minimization; CLASSIFICATION; robust deep autoencoder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While their use continues to spread across the field of atmospheric chemistry, the air quality monitoring community, and for commercial and private use, challenges remain in ensuring data quality and comparability of calibration methods. This study introduces a seven-step methodology for the field calibration of low-cost sensor systems using reference instrumentation with user-friendly guidelines, open-access code, and a discussion of common barriers to such an approach. The methodology has been developed and is applicable for gas-phase pollutants, such as for the measurement of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or ozone (O-3). A full example of the application of this methodology to a case study in an urban environment using both multiple linear regression (MLR) and the random forest (RF) machine-learning technique is presented with relevant R code provided, including error estimation. In this case, we have applied it to the calibration of metal oxide gas-phase sensors (MOSs). Results reiterate previous findings that MLR and RF are similarly accurate, though with differing limitations. The methodology presented here goes a step further than most studies by including explicit transparent steps for addressing model selection, validation, and tuning, as well as addressing the common issues of autocorrelation and multicollinearity. We also highlight the need for standardized reporting of methods for data cleaning and flagging, model selection and tuning, and model metrics.

Design/methodology/approach In developing a complete CBM strategy, two main difficulties have to be overcome: (1) appropriately dealing with incomplete and low-quality production database and (2) selecting the most promising predictive model. The first issue has been addressed applying data cleansing operations and creating ad hoc methodology to enlarge the training data. The second issue has been handled developing and comparing an empirical model with a machine learning (ML)-based model; the comparison has been performed assessing capabilities thereof in predicting erroneous label cuts on data obtained from an operating plant located in Italy. Findings Research results showed that both empirical and ML-based approaches exhibit good performances in detecting the operating conditions of the cutting machine. The advantage of adopting an ML-based model is that it can be used not only as a condition indicator (i.e. a model able to continuously provide the health status of an asset) but also in predictive maintenance policies (i.e. a CBM carried out following a forecast of the degradation of the item). Research limitations/implications The study described in this manuscript has been developed on the practices of a labeling machine developed by an international company manufacturing bottling lines for beverage industry. The proposed approach might need some customization in case it is applied to other industries. Future researches can validate the applicability of such models on different rotary machines in other companies and similar industries. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper lies in the empirical demonstration of the benefits of CBM and predictive maintenance in manufacturing, through the overcoming of a specific production issue. The large number of variables involved in thin label cutting lines (film thickness between 30 and 38 mu m), the high throughput and the high costs due to production interruptions render the prediction of non-conforming labels an economically relevant, albeit challenging, goal. Moreover, despite the large scientific literature on CBM in rolling bearing and face cutting movements, papers dealing with rotary labeling machines are very unusual and unique.","2021-10-26","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 02:44:51","","565-585","","4","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000572418600001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JQME-10-2019-0101","Machine learning; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Turing machines; Industrial research; Manufacture; Roller bearings; Predictive maintenance; Throughput; Beverages; Entertainment industry; Rotating machinery; SUPPORT; CARBIDE TOOL; Cleansing data; Condition based maintenance; CUTTING PERFORMANCE; DRIVEN; Enlarging data set; FAILURE; Failure signature analysis; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; Prognostics; Weighted root mean square variation model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aims to answer the question to what extent advanced computational methods can improve the data acquisition and analysis of unstructured data sets stemming from various blogs and forums. Furthermore, the authors intend to explore to what extent the sentiment analysis is able to objectify the qualitative results identified by an earlier analysis by the authors using content analysis done by thematic coding. For the purpose of the specific tourism research question in this paper a new approach is proposed, which consists of a combination of sentiment analyses, supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction in order to identify terms that strongly load on specific emotions. The contribution indicates on the one hand, that advanced computational methods have their own specific constraints, but on the other hand, are able to provide a richer and deeper analysis following a quantitative approach. Several issues have to be taken into account, such as data protection constraints, the need for data cleaning, such as word stemming, dimension reduction, such as removal of custom stop words, and the development of descent ontologies. On the other hand, the quantitative method also provides, due to its standardised procedure, a less subjective insight in the given content, but is not less time consuming than traditional content analysis.","2021-09","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 03:42:39","","167-190","","2","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000695333500003","","","","","","","sentiment analysis; text mining; BIG DATA; lasso regression; tourism; web scraping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One-class classification techniques, which aim to identify anomalies as the minority class from the normal data as the majority class, are one representative solution for class imbalanced datasets. Since one-class classifiers are trained using only normal data to create a decision boundary for later anomaly detection, the quality of the training set, i.e. the majority class, is one key factor that affects the performance of one-class classifiers. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, we focus on two data cleaning or preprocessing methods to address class imbalanced datasets. The first method examines whether performing instance selection to remove some noisy data from the majority class can improve the performance of one-class classifiers. The second method combines instance selection and missing value imputation, where the latter is used to handle incomplete datasets that contain missing values. Findings The experimental results are based on 44 class imbalanced datasets; three instance selection algorithms, including IB3, DROP3 and the GA, the CART decision tree for missing value imputation, and three one-class classifiers, which include OCSVM, IFOREST and LOF, show that if the instance selection algorithm is carefully chosen, performing this step could improve the quality of the training data, which makes one-class classifiers outperform the baselines without instance selection. Moreover, when class imbalanced datasets contain some missing values, combining missing value imputation and instance selection, regardless of which step is first performed, can maintain similar data quality as datasets without missing values. Originality/value The novelty of this paper is to investigate the effect of performing instance selection on the performance of one-class classifiers, which has never been done before. Moreover, this study is the first attempt to consider the scenario of missing values that exist in the training set for training one-class classifiers. In this case, performing missing value imputation and instance selection with different orders are compared.","2021-10-11","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 03:02:00","","771-787","","5","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000651906600001","","","","","","","Machine learning; Data mining; ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; Instance selection; REDUCTION; Class imbalance; Missing value imputation; One-class classifiers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the prediction accuracy of SMART is unsatisfactory, recently, machine learning techniques have been explored to improve the prediction accuracy. Those approaches treat disk failure prediction as a binary classification problem and take SMART attributes as features, and some of them achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, there is no uniform metric to measure the financial impact of these methods whose primary objective is to reduce disk failure recovery costs via disk failure prediction. In this article, from a financial impact perspective, we propose a simple, yet practical, metric Mean-Cost-To-Recovery (MCTR) for disk failure prediction in data centers. Specifically, by assigning different weights to mispredicted healthy disks and failed disks, we measure the entire misprediction costs, that is, MCTR. In addition, we argue that the commonly used threshold 0.5 for disk failure prediction is suboptimal because of the fact of data imbalance, that is, failed disks are much fewer than healthy ones. To find the optimal threshold which renders minimal MCTR, we wrap a cost-minimizing procedure around disk failure prediction and use a threshold-moving technique for searching. Moreover, to map sample-level prediction results to disk-level prediction results, a modified leaky-bucket algorithm is design to determine the disk health state by considering its multiple sample-level prediction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments using three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that compared with reactive data protection schemes, we can reduce MCTR by up to 86.9%, and compared with cost-blind failure predictions, we can reduce MCTR by up to 22.3%.","2020-07-25","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 14:34:09","","","","14","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000522738200001","","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpe.5669","Learning systems; Forecasting; Digital storage; Cost reduction; Data privacy; machine learning; PERFORMANCE; failure prediction; failure recovery cost; hard disk drive; SMART","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the utility of genetic information in the clinical decision-making process has not been examined extensively from a real-world, data-driven perspective. Through mining real-world data (RWD) from clinical notes, we could extract patients' genetic information and further associate treatment decisions with genetic information. Methods: We proposed a real-world evidence (RWE) study framework that incorporates context-based natural language processing (NLP) methods and data quality examination before final association analysis. The framework was demonstrated in a Foundation-tested women cancer cohort (N = 196). Upon retrieval of patients' genetic information using NLP system, we assessed the completeness of genetic data captured in unstructured clinical notes according to a genetic data-model. We examined the distribution of different topics regarding BRCA1/2 throughout patients' treatment process, and then analyzed the association between BRCA1/2 mutation status and the discussion/prescription of targeted therapy. Results: We identified seven topics in the clinical context of genetic mentions including: Information, Evaluation, Insurance, Order, Negative, Positive, and Variants of unknown significance. Our rule-based system achieved a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.93 and F-measure of 0.91. Our machine learning system achieved a precision of 0.901, recall of 0.899 and F-measure of 0.9 for four-topic classification and a precision of 0.833, recall of 0.823 and F-measure of 0.82 for seven-topic classification. We found in result-containing sentences, the capture of BRCA1/2 mutation information was 75%, but detailed variant information (e.g. variant types) is largely missing. Using cleaned RWD, significant associations were found between BRCA1/2 positive mutation and targeted therapies. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrated a framework to generate RWE using RWD from different clinical sources. Rule-based NLP system achieved the best performance for resolving contextual variability when extracting RWD from unstructured clinical notes. Data quality issues such as incompleteness and discrepancies exist thus manual data cleaning is needed before further analysis can be performed. Finally, we were able to use cleaned RWD to evaluate the real-world utility of genetic information to initiate a prescription of targeted therapy.","2021-01-06","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 13:38:29","","","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000608043800001","","","","","","","Natural language processing; Electronic health records; PHENOTYPES; BRCA1; BRCA1/2; CANCER; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; INDIVIDUALIZED MEDICINE; PARP inhibitor; Precision medicine; Real-world evidence; VARIANTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: We describe the construction of machine-learning models for current-visit prediction (CVP), which can help physicians obtain more information for accurate diagnosis, and next-visit prediction (NVP), which can help physicians provide potential high-risk patients with advice to effectively prevent FLD. Methods: The large-scale and high-dimensional dataset used in this study comes from Taipei MJ Health Research Foundation in Taiwan. We used one-pass ranking and sequential forward selection (SFS) for feature selection in FLD prediction. For CVP, we explored multiple models, including k-nearest-neighbor classifier (KNNC), Adaboost, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), decision trees C4.5 (C4.5), and classification and regression trees (CART). For NVP, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) and several of its variants as sequence classifiers that use various input sets for prediction. Model performance was evaluated based on two criteria: the accuracy of the test set and the intersection over union/coverage between the features selected by one-pass ranking/SFS and by domain experts. The accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for both CVP and NVP for males and females, respectively. Results: After data cleaning, the dataset included 34,856 and 31,394 unique visits respectively for males and females for the period 2009-2016. The test accuracy of CVP using KNNC, Adaboost, SVM, LR, RF, GNB, C4.5, and CART was respectively 84.28%, 83.84%, 82.22%, 82.21%, 76.03%, 75.78%, and 75.53%. The test accuracy of NVP using LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM), Stack-LSTM, Stack-biLSTM, and Attention-LSTM was respectively 76.54%, 76.66%, 77.23%, 76.84%, and 77.31% for fixed-interval features, and was 79.29%, 79.12%, 79.32%, 79.29%, and 78.36%, respectively, for variable-interval features. Conclusions: This study explored a large-scale FLD dataset with high dimensionality. We developed FLD prediction models for CVP and NVP. We also implemented efficient feature selection schemes for current- and next-visit prediction to compare the automatically selected features with expert-selected features. In particular, NVP emerged as more valuable from the viewpoint of preventive medicine. For NVP, we propose use of feature set 2 (with variable intervals), which is more compact and flexible. We have also tested several variants of LSTM in combination with two feature sets to identify the best match for male and female FLD prediction. More specifically, the best model for males was Stack-LSTM using feature set 2 (with 79.32% accuracy), whereas the best model for females was LSTM using feature set 1 (with 81.90% accuracy).","2021-08","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 02:54:25","","","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000690953500008","","","","","","","machine learning; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURE-SELECTION; MANAGEMENT; alcohol fatty liver disease; AMERICAN ASSOCIATION; current-visit prediction; fatty liver diseases; long short-term memory; next-visit prediction; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; one-pass ranking; sequence forward selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"BUMIADZ9","journalArticle","","Mir, AA; Rathinam, S; Gul, S","Public perception of COVID-19 vaccines from the digital footprints left on Twitter: analyzing positive, neutral and negative sentiments of Twitterati","LIBRARY HI TECH","","0737-8831","10.1108/LHT-08-2021-0261","","Purpose Twitter is gaining popularity as a microblogging and social networking service to discuss various social issues. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and is discussed worldwide. Social media is an instant platform to deliberate various dimensions of COVID-19. The purpose of the study is to explore and analyze the public sentiments related to COVID-19 vaccines across the Twitter messages (positive, neutral, and negative) and the impact tweets make across digital social circles. Design/methodology/approach To fetch the vaccine-related posts, a manual examination of randomly selected 500 tweets was carried out to identify the popular hashtags relevant to the vaccine conversation. It was found that the hashtags ""covid19vaccine"" and ""coronavirusvaccine"" were the two popular hashtags used to discuss the communications related to COVID-19 vaccines. 23,575 global tweets available in public domain were retrieved through ""Twitter Application Programming Interface"" (API), using ""Orange Software"", an open-source machine learning, data visualization and data mining toolkit. The study was confined to the tweets posted in English language only. The default data cleaning and preprocessing techniques available in the ""Orange Software"" were applied to the dataset, which include ""transformation"", ""tokenization"" and ""filtering"". The ""Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning"" (VADER) tool was used for classification of tweets to determine the tweet sentiments (positive, neutral and negative) as well as the degree of sentiments (compound score also known as sentiment score). To assess the influence/impact of tweets account wise (verified and unverified) and sentiment wise (positive, neutral, and negative), the retweets and likes, which offer a sort of reward or acknowledgment of tweets, were used. Findings A gradual decline in the number of tweets over the time is observed. Majority (11,205; 47.52%) of tweets express positive sentiments, followed by neutral (7,948; 33.71%) and negative sentiments (4,422; 18.75%), respectively. The study also signifies a substantial difference between the impact of tweets tweeted by verified and unverified users. The tweets related to verified users have a higher impact both in terms of retweets (65.91%) and likes (84.62%) compared to the tweets tweeted by unverified users. Tweets expressing positive sentiments have the highest impact both in terms of likes (mean = 10.48) and retweets (mean = 3.07) compared to those that express neutral or negative sentiments. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of the study is that the sentiments of the people expressed over one single social platform, that is, Twitter have been studied which cannot generalize the global public perceptions. There can be a variation in the results when the datasets from other social media platforms will be studied. Practical implications The study will help to know the people's sentiments and beliefs toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Sentiments that people hold about the COVID-19 vaccines are studied, which will help health policymakers understand the polarity (positive, negative, and neutral) of the tweets and thus see the public reaction and reflect the types of information people are exposed to about vaccines. The study can aid the health sectors to intensify positive messages and eliminate negative messages for an enhanced vaccination uptake. The research can also help design more operative vaccine-advocating communication by customizing messages using the obtained knowledge from the sentiments and opinions about the vaccines. Originality/value The paper focuses on an essential aspect of COVID-19 vaccines and how people express themselves (positively, neutrally and negatively) on Twitter.","","2022-06-13 21:23:41","2022-07-31 15:20:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000706255100001","","","","","","","Sentiment analysis; COVID-19; Twitter; MANAGEMENT; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID outbreak; COVID-19 vaccines; Crisis communications; Crisis informatics; Disaster informatics; TWEETS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diverse machine learning approaches are implemented for predicting the cancer recurrence that needs to be evaluated for showing the appropriate approach for cancer prediction. This paper provides intelligent optimized ensemble learning for predicting multiple types of cancers. At first, the different types of cancer data are collected and performed the data cleansing. Then, the feature extraction is done using statistical features, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). With these features, a new Adaptive Condition Searched-Harris hawks Whale Optimization (ACS-HWO) is used for selecting the optimal features and transformed into weighted features with meta-heuristic update. The prediction is carried out by Optimized Ensemble-based Multi-disease Detection (OEMD) with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Autoencoder, Adaboost, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with high ranking strategy. The same ACS-HWO is used for improvising the weighted feature selection and optimized ensemble learning.

Although pollutants can be filtered to a considerable extent by after-treatment devices equipment, emissions can still exceed the designated standards when after-treatment devices function improperly. To timely identify excessive emissions, we propose a general and systematic framework, including a data quality assessment and a data repairing and excessive emission determination process, based on the data sensed from the on-board diagnostics (OBD) monitoring system. To overcome the adverse effects of poor data quality, a set of approaches have been developed for the different statuses of data quality. When all variables contain missing or abnormal values, data repairing algorithms can be employed to improve data quality. Two strategies have been developed for the situation where only the NOx data is problematic. One is to improve data quality by using the other variables before identifying excessive emissions, and the other is to directly predict whether the emissions exceed recommendations by using other variables without the data quality problem. To reduce the impact of noise and extreme values, three methods based on the moving average principle have been developed to generate an aggregated emission level for the determination of excessive emissions. In the experimental study, we employed a number of machine learning algorithms to achieve data repairing and prediction. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm slightly outperforms the random forests (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) in the prediction of the excessive emission possibility in terms of prediction accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the most accurate data repairing can be achieved by probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), as compared to non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). However, the proposed approach does not restrict other algorithms from achieving the functions of data repairing and prediction.  2022 by the authors.

Appropriate polishing parameters are mainly based on an accurate polishing model and an excellent polishing parameters optimization algorithm. However, due to the complicated principle of MCF polishing and various influencing elements, traditional modeling methods have the limitations of low accuracy, poor application, and difficulty in correcting. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain the optimal polishing quality by optimizing the polishing parameters based on the traditional model. This study proposed an online modeling approach considering data cleaning based on machine learning modeling, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize polishing parameters. Then, copper polishing experiments were carried out to validate the modeling and optimization methods.

The quality professionals are required to classify and review the inspection texts according to the project category. However, manual processing of a sheer amount of textual data is not only time-consuming, laborious but also error-prone, which could lead to overlooked quality issues and harm the overall project performance. In response, this paper uses the text mining method to mine the hidden information from unstructured text records. First, obtain quality text records on-site, use data cleaning method to obtain 9859 clean data, then use both Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) pre-training and Word2vec methods to quantify the text into a digital representation, next improve the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by expanding input channels, and input the quantified text into the model to extract key features to realize the integration of quality records according to established categories. The results show that the average precision of the proposed model is 89.69%. Compared with CNN, BERT, and other models, this model has less manual intervention, less time-consuming training, and higher precision. Finally, through data augmentation of small sample data, the precision of the model is further improved, reaching 92.02%. The proposed model can assist quality professionals to quickly spot key quality issues and reference corresponding quality standards for further actions, and allow them to focus on more value-added efforts, e.g., making decisions and planning for corrective actions. This research also provides a reference for the ultimate goal of constructing an intelligent project management system.  2022 Elsevier Ltd","2022","2022-07-27 17:24:58","2022-07-31 05:49:50","","","","","53","","Advanced Engineering Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2022.101669","Deep learning; Quality control; Information management; Natural language processing systems; Data mining; Convolutional neural networks; Quality assurance; Natural language processing; Text processing; Text mining; Character recognition; Neural network models; Project management; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BIG DATA; Auxiliary management; Construction quality control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to climate change, various sectors are affected, and one of the sectors is healthcare. As a result of climate change, the geographic range of several vector-borne human infectious diseases will expand. Currently, dengue is taking its toll, and climate change is one of the key reasons contributing to the intensification of dengue disease transmission. The most important climatic factors linked to dengue transmission are temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. The present study carries out a systematic literature review on the surveillance system to predict dengue outbreaks based on Machine Learning modeling techniques. The systematic literature review discusses the methodology and objectives, the number of studies carried out in different regions and periods, the association between climatic factors and the increase in positive dengue cases. This study also includes a detailed investigation of meteorological data, the dengue positive patient data, and the pre-processing techniques used for data cleaning. Furthermore, correlation techniques in several studies to determine the relationship between dengue incidence and meteorological parameters and machine learning models for predictive analysis are discussed. In the future direction for creating a dengue surveillance system, several research challenges and limitations of current work are discussed.","2022-05-27","2022-07-27 17:34:23","2022-07-27 17:34:23","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000811397100001","","","","","","","machine learning; predictive models; RISK; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; MODEL; climatic factors; dengue; FEVER; surveillance system; VARIABILITY; WEATHER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It involves dysfunction of blood sugar regulation resulting from insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, or excessive glucagon secretion. Methods: This study collated 971,401 drug usage records of 51,009 DM patients. These data include patient identification code, age, gender, outpatient visiting dates, visiting code, medication features (included items, doses, and frequencies of drugs), HbA1c results, and testing time. We apply a random forest (RF) model for feature selection and implement a regression model with the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) deep learning architecture. Finally, we use the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index for the prediction model. Results: After data cleaning, the data included 8,729 male and 9,115 female cases. Metformin was the most important feature suggested by the RF model, followed by glimepiride, acarbose, pioglitazone, glibenclamide, gliclazide, repaglinide, nateglinide, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin. The model performed better with the past two seasons in the training data than with additional seasons. Further, the Bi-LSTM architecture model performed better than support vector machines (SVMs). Discussion & Conclusion: This study found that Bi-LSTM models is a well kernel in a CDSS which help physicians' decision-making, and the increasing the number of seasons will negative impact the performance. In addition, this study found that the most important drug is metformin, which is recommended as first-line treatment OHA in various situations for DM patients.","2022","2022-07-27 17:34:33","2022-07-27 17:34:33","","1049-1055","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000821968200004","","","","","","","Deep Learning; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; MODEL; Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM); CARE; Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS); Diabetes Mellitus; Electronic Health Record; Oral Hypoglycemic Agents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
