TUVEQ7H6,journalArticle,2022.0,"Yang, Kang; Ding, Youliang; Jiang, Huachen; Zhao, Hanwei; Luo, Gan",A two-stage data cleansing method for bridge global positioning system monitoring data based on bi-direction long and short term memory anomaly identification and conditional generative adversarial networks data repair,,,15452255,10.1002/stc.2993,,"Data cleansing is an essential approach for improving data quality. Therefore, it is the key to avoiding the false alarm of the monitoring system due to the anomaly of the data itself. Data cleansing consists of two parts: anomaly identification and anomaly repair. However, current research on data cleansing has mainly focused on anomaly identification and lacks efficient data repair methods. The key to data repair lies in sensor correlation models based on mapping relationships between sensors. To obtain a good inter-sensor relationship model, it is first necessary to exclude anomalous data from the training data set used for modeling. Therefore, a two-stage data cleansing framework for collaborative multi-sensor repair is proposed. First, based on the analysis of anomalous features of GPS data, a bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network model is adopted for data anomalies classification and localization. As a result, the data segment to be repaired is determined. Then, on the basis of all sensor data in the time range of the day before the target repair data segment, the data set for data repair is constructed by excluding the anomaly data segments in the data set with the help of the above anomaly identification results. Then, a conditional generation adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed to achieve data repair. Experimental validation shows that the two-stage data cleansing method of identification followed by repair can accurately identify and repair GPS anomalies. Finally, several factors affecting the repair effect are discussed. 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,2022-06-10 02:09:03,2022-07-31 01:45:08,,,,,,,,,Structural Control and Health Monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/stc.2993,Anomaly detection; Brain; Generative adversarial networks; Global positioning system; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Repair; anomaly detection; data repair; data cleansing; bidirectional long- and short-term memory neural network; conditional generation adversarial network; ONLINE; OUTLIER DETECTION; RECOVERY; REGRESSION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in domain adaptation. However, most of them leverage unlabeled target data only from a statistical perspective but neglect the analysis at the instance level. For better statistical alignment, existing approaches employ the entire unevaluated target data in an unsupervised manner, which may introduce noise and limit the discriminability of the neural networks. In this article, we propose confident learning-based domain adaptation (CLDA) to address the problem from a new perspective of data manipulation. To this end, a novel framework is presented to combine domain adaptation with confident learning (CL), where the former reduces the interdomain discrepancy and generates pseudo-labels for the target instances, from which the latter selects high-confidence target samples. Specifically, the confident learning part evaluates the confidence of each pseudo-labeled target sample based on the assigned labels and the predicted probabilities. Then, high-confidence target samples are selected as training data to increase the discriminative capacity of the neural networks. In addition, the domain adaptation part and the confident learning part are trained alternately to progressively increase the proportion of high-confidence labels in the target domain, thus further improving the accuracy of classification. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLDA method outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.

The ANFIS is a family of the deep learning algorithm, which incorporates the benefits of adaptive control technique, artificial neural network, and the fuzzy inference system. Thus, it is expected to produce very accurate predictions even for the highly nonlinear system. Forced vibration responses of a five-story steel building were simulated by ANFIS and its accuracy was compared with the results of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a type of traditional artificial neural networks. Simulations by ANFIS were very accurate with a much lower root means square error (RMSE) than RNN. Simulated data by ANFIS showed an almost perfect match with the original. Even the small ripples in the power spectrum plot outside the dominant frequency were successfully reproduced. In addition, the ANFIS was used to increase the sampling rate of dynamic data. It was shown that missing high-frequency contents could be successfully reproduced when the ANFIS was properly trained.

For a given dataset and a given analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal ML model quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start or which methods to use. Most current work focus either on proposing new data cleaning algorithms -often specific to certain types of data glitches considered in isolation and generally with no ""pipeline vision"" of the whole data preprocessing sequence- or on developing automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of the given ML model but that often rely on by-default preprocessing methods.

Improved performance is possible by transductive inference, where the entire test set is available concurrently, and semi-supervised learning, where more unlabeled data is available. These problems are closely related because there is little or no adaptation of the representation in novel tasks. Focusing on these two settings, we introduce a new algorithm that leverages the manifold structure of the labeled and unlabeled data distribution to predict pseudo-labels, while balancing over classes and using the loss value distribution of a limited-capacity classifier to select the cleanest labels, iterately improving the quality of pseudo-labels.

The interference and damage of sensors are common phenomena in actual industrial production. In this case, the data collected by the sensors is incorrect and unavailable and cannot be fed into the prediction model for work. Incorrect data leads to inaccurate predictions, and the predictions lead to incorrect actions, which ultimately affect the activities of the entire industrial assembly line. How is this kind of problem data dealt with? This is the first time that generative adversarial networks (GAN) technology has been used to repair missing boiler data.

In this case, we divided data cleaning into supervised and unsupervised forms according to whether there were interventions in the repair processes and put forward a new dimension suitable for unsupervised cleaning in this paper. For weak logic errors in unsupervised data cleaning, we proposed an attribute correlation-based (ACB)-Framework under blocking, and designed three different data blocking methods to reduce the time complexity and test the impact of clustering accuracy on data cleaning. The experiments showed that the blocking methods could effectively reduce the repair time by maintaining the repair validity. Moreover, we concluded that the blocking methods with a too high clustering accuracy tended to put tuples with the same elements into a data block, which reduced the cleaning ability.

This technology digs out the implicit associations between data, converts them into fuzzy rules in the form of Probabilistic soft logic (PSL), and builds a neural network based on this for data cleaning.  2020 IEEE.",2020,2022-06-10 02:09:06,2022-07-31 04:38:46,,3024-3027,,,,,,,"2020 IEEE 4th Conference on Energy Internet and Energy System Integration: Connecting the Grids Towards a Low-Carbon High-Efficiency Energy System, EI2 2020",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Wuhan, China",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EI250167.2020.9346757,Cleaning; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Neural networks; Internet; Data integration; Fuzzy rules; Renewable energy resources; Power systems; Data Clean; Fuzzy Rules; Probabilistic logic; Probabilistic Soft Logic; Renewable Energy Accommodation; Renewable energy sources; System integration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In this paper, we present SPADE, a novel semi-supervised probabilistic approach for error detection. SPADE introduces a novel probabilistic active learning model, where the system suggests examples to be labeled based on the agreements between user labels and indicative signals, which are designed to capture potential errors. SPADE uses a two-phase data augmentation process to enrich a dataset before training a deep-learning classifier to detect unlabeled errors. In our evaluation, SPADE achieves an average F1-score of 0.91 over five datasets and yields a 10% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art systems.  2021 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Data-driven approaches, such as deep learning and machine learning, are promising in constructing the gesture generation model, which automatically provides the gesture motion for speech or spoken texts. This study experimentally analyzes a deep learning-based gesture generation model from spoken text using a convolutional neural network. The proposed model takes a sequence of spoken words as the input and outputs a sequence of 2D joint coordinates representing the conversational gesture motion. We prepare a dataset consisting of gesture motions and spoken texts by adding text information to an existing dataset and train the models using specific speaker's data. The quality of the generated gestures is compared with those from an existing speech-to-gesture generation model through a user perceptual study. The subjective evaluation shows that the model performance is comparable or superior to those by the existing speech-to-gesture generation model. In addition, we investigate the importance of data cleansing and loss function selection in the text-to-gesture generation model. We further examine the model transferability between speakers. The experimental results demonstrate successful model transferability of the proposed model. Finally, we show that the text-to-gesture generation model can produce good quality gestures even when using a transformer architecture.  2022 The Author(s)",2022,2022-06-10 02:09:06,2022-07-31 13:53:44,,365-375,,,151,,Neural Networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2022.03.041,Convolution; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Gesture generation; Network architecture; Spoken text; Transfer learning; Transformer architecture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.  2014 IEEE.",2021,2022-06-10 02:09:06,2022-07-31 14:18:07,,16153-16164,,21,8,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016297,Big data; Cleaning; Deep learning; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Feature extraction; Health care; Internet of things; feature selection; Internet of Things; Training; Correlation; Deep Q-network (DQN); multisourced data; Mutual information; reinforcement learning; Smart cities; ALGORITHM; ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY; MUTUAL INFORMATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

To address these issues, we propose a new image data cleaning framework using deep neural networks, named ImageDC, to improve the quality of the datasets.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can suggest influential instances without using any domain knowledge. With the proposed method, users only need to inspect the instances suggested by the algorithm, implying that users do not need extensive knowledge for this procedure, which enables even non-experts to conduct data cleansing and improve the model. The existing methods require the loss function to be convex and an optimal model to be obtained, which is not always the case in modern machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach specifically designed for the models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method infers the influential instances by retracing the steps of the SGD while incorporating intermediate models computed in each step. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately infer the influential instances. Moreover, we used MNIST and CIFAR10 to show that the models can be effectively improved by removing the influential instances suggested by the proposed method. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Organs are often labeled inconsistently at different institutions (sometimes even within the same institution) and at different time periods, which poses a problem for clinical research, especially for multi-institutional collaborative clinical research where the acquired patient data is not being used effectively. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically identify each organ in the CT image and then label it with the standardized nomenclature presented at AAPM Task Group 263.

DAXPUHR9,journalArticle,2020.0,"Chhatbar, Darshak; Ahmed, Umair Z.; Kar, Purushottam",MACER: A Modular Framework for Accelerated Compilation Error Repair,,,,,,"Automated compilation error repair, the problem of suggesting fixes to buggy programs that fail to compile, has generated significant interest in recent years. Apart from being a tool of general convenience, automated code repair has significant pedagogical applications for novice programmers who find compiler error messages cryptic and unhelpful. Existing approaches largely solve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative learning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box application of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of training time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types. We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive discriminative learning techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair. Experiments indicate that the fine-grained approach adopted by MACER offers not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student. MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types  whether popular or rare. MACER offers a training time speedup of 2 over TRACER and 800 over RLAssist, and a test time speedup of 2  4 over both. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This paper presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs.

Nowadays, deep learning has become a key research component of the Sixth-Generation wireless systems (6G) with numerous regulatory and defense applications. In order to facilitate the application of deep learning in radio signal recognition, in this work, a large-scale real-world radio signal dataset is created based on a special aeronautical monitoring system - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). This paper makes two main contributions. First, an automatic data collection and labeling system is designed to capture over-the-air ADS-B signals in the open and real-world scenario without human participation. Through data cleaning and sorting, a high-quality dataset of ADS-B signals is created for radio signal recognition. Second, we conduct an in-depth study on the performance of deep learning models using the new dataset, as well as comparison with a recognition benchmark using machine learning and deep learning methods.

In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CORDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CORDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CORDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2% on public benchmark datasets. Moreover, CORDEL yields a 2.4% improvement over the current best DL model on the real-world dataset, while reducing the number of training parameters by 97.6%. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

As a result, software engineering needs to be re-thought where data becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation is that 8090% of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation and data cleaning techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training where using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model training. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve problems in these directions.  2021, CC BY.",2021,2022-06-10 02:09:09,2022-07-31 14:31:55,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: arXiv,,,,Data acquisition; Data reduction; Deep learning; Information management; Learning algorithms; Software engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

We propose to rank instances according to estimated label correctness and labelling difficulty of each sample, and introduce a simulation framework to evaluate relabelling efficacy. Our experiments on natural images and on a new medical imaging benchmark show that cleaning noisy labels mitigates their negative impact on model training, evaluation, and selection.

Indeed, recognizing human activities will help provide appropriate assistance to older adults, fighting the consequences of the population aging at the same time. For example, specific organizations, such as United Nations, reported an important risk of qualified human resources shortage to care for older adults in-home care. Hence, HAR solutions based on Ambient Intelligence (AmI) have been proposed to face these consequences. Therefore, we denoted an increasing interest in Ultra-WideBand (UWB) radars for HAR these last years. In this work, we exploited three UWB radars to recognize 15 human activities performed by 9 participants in a prototype apartment. The main contribution in this paper is data cleaning. Indeed, data provided by UWB radars have been cleaned with a band-pass Chebyshev type I filter of order 2. The application of that kind of filter is uncommon in the literature with the data of UWB radars. Also, this filter has been selected according to tests made with different filter types, and classification performances attest that data filtering is efficient. In addition, two different deep learning architectures to classify the cleaned data have been exploited. The first is a relatively simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the second is Efficient-CapsNet.

Advances in machine learning techniques have allowed researchers to make substantial gains in tackling complex problems in diverse fields such as medical diagnosis through image analysis, object detection and tracking, and natural language processing. However, often researchers only employ one or two machine learning algorithms with a static feature set while only testing a single hypothesis. This self-imposed bottleneck often produces suboptimal results because it arises from using machine learning within the classical, algorithmic context using existing development tools. Therefore, there is a need to create new development tools which reflect this change to the machine learning paradigm. In this research, we propose a development environment that allows researchers to leverage those capabilities more fully by shifting not only the tool they use but also their mindset. Our proposed environment serves as an intermediate tool, guiding the researcher and making full adoption of the machine learning paradigm throughout the software development process easier. To accomplish this, our framework is defined by a three-layer structure designed for subject domain assessment, data manipulation and feature set exploration. Supported by parallelism, data cleaning and feature engineering, this research provides a conceptual basis for future creation of development environments for the machine learning paradigm. Future development of such a conceptual design would allow for additional intelligent tools to aid the user in designing solutions and support reusability at the design level.  2022 IEEE.",2022,2022-06-10 02:09:10,2022-07-30 22:28:49,,329-331,,,2022-March,,,,Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Mobile, AL, United states",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SoutheastCon48659.2022.9764094,Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Software design; Diagnosis; Natural language processing systems; Medical imaging; Object detection; machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Software; Focusing; Natural language processing; Reusability; development environment; Parallel processing; software development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

To overcome the above problem, an efficient and accurate data anomaly detection method is desiderated. Traditional anomaly detection methods extract various abnormal features as the key indicators to identify data anomalies. Then set thresholds artificially for various features to identify specific anomalies, which is the artificial experience method. However, limited by the poor generalization ability among sensors, this method often leads to high labor costs. Another approach to anomaly detection is a data-driven approach based on machine learning methods. Among these, the bidirectional long-short memory neural network (BiLSTM), as an effective classification method, excels at finding complex relationships in multivariate time series data. However, training unprocessed original signals often leads to low computation efficiency and poor convergence, for lacking appropriate feature selection. Therefore, this article combines the advantages of the two methods by proposing a deep learning method with manual experience statistical features fed into it. Experimental comparative studies illustrate that the BiLSTM model with appropriate feature input has an accuracy rate of over 87-94%. Meanwhile, this paper provides basic principles of data cleaning and discusses the typical features of various anomalies. Furthermore, the optimization strategies of the feature space selection based on artificial experience are also highlighted.

Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision  depth, breadth, and usability  to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices.

On a corpus of Russian language tweets three models were tested to solve binary classification problem: Logistic regression (LR), XGBoost classifier and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The paper descriptively overviews main techniques useful for data cleaning and preprocessing for these methods and covers its possible fitfalls. Based on the study CNN showed best results among chosen models, which goes in line with several articles in the field for other than Russian languages. Together with high predictive results, neural networks exhibit a computational drawback - their performance is poor in terms of timings. Besides this, all methods showed high sensitivity to the way data is preprocessed, which is a product of Russian language variability. This leads to a conclusion that there is still a room for improvement - in future research more emphasis will be put on hyper parameter tuning for""boosting type"" models and extending list of applied methods.

We introduce a paradigm called Trusted Machine Learning (TML) with the goal of making learning techniques more trustworthy. We outline methods that show how symbolic analysis (specifically parametric model checking) can be used to learn the dynamical model of a system where the learned model satisfies correctness requirements specified in the form of temporal logic properties (e.g., safety, liveness). When a learned model does not satisfy the desired guarantees, we try two approaches: (1) Model Repair, wherein we modify a learned model directly, and (2) Data Repair, wherein we modify the data so that re-learning from the modified data will result in a trusted model. Model Repair tries to make the minimal changes to the trained model while satisfying the properties, whereas Data Repair tries to make the minimal changes to the dataset used to train the model for ensuring satisfaction of the properties. We show how the Model Repair and Data Repair problems can be solved for the case of probabilistic models, specifically Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) or Markov Decision Processes (MDP), when the desired properties are expressed in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). Specifically, we outline how the parameter learning problem in the probabilistic Markov models under temporal logic constraints can be equivalently expressed as a non-linear optimization with non-linear rational constraints, by performing symbolic transformations using a parametric model checker. We illustrate the approach on two case studies: A controller for automobile lane changing, and query router for a wireless sensor network.  2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Therefore, hotspot identification of crimes by analysing real-time dataset has become essential and will significantly benefit the public by accurately analysing the dangerous locations. This paper aims to develop the framework model for identifying criminal hotspots using a modified K-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm by considering different crime characteristics like the severity of the crime, frequency of crime and temporal data of crime by visualising hotspots using geographic information system (GIS). This study analyses the real dataset of crime for the recent five years collected from the Commissioner of Police of Gurgaon, Haryana. The data cleaning and pre-processing strategies have been applied to make data ready for further training the model. The results demonstrate locations of the different hotspots based on the density of crime occurrences, and accurate visualisation of hotspots using GIS display is done by supervised learning and unsupervised classifiers.

Defect layer identification is a labor-intensive task that requires domain knowledge of experts to make consistent decisions over multiple datasets. Sometimes, it also requires examining multiple sources of inspection images to make the final identification. In this paper, we propose a multimodal machine learning model for defect layer identification as a classification problem from multiple sources of input images. After training two single modal models from each input source, we develop a final joint fusion model to achieve the best classification performance. This work also demonstrates how to estimate the final fusion model performance without exhaustively trying all possible combinations of single modal models. In order to integrate the approach into an industrial display manufacturing defect data analytic, we propose the data coverage model, which guarantees human-level classification performance within a certain portion of data. The data coverage model improves the robustness of the multimodal model, utilizing confident learning to make a high-confidence predictions for the particle defect layer identification and adding a filter to assess whether data samples are within the coverage based on the model's latent space density estimation. This work uses particle defects data samples in 8 different layers as a combination of TEM and STEM images from display manufacturing fabrication lines. Our experimental results show that the classification accuracy improves substantially by deploying the proposed multimodal model.

Traditional data sorting cannot meet the growing demand of MCF research because of the low-efficiency, time-delay, and lack of objective criteria. In this paper, a Time-Domain Global Similarity (TDGS) method based on machine learning technologies is proposed for the automatic data cleaning of MCF devices. The aim of traditional data sorting is to classify original diagnostic data sequences. The lengths and evolution properties of the data sequences vary shot by shot. Hence the classification criteria are affected by many discharge parameters and are different in various discharges. The focus of the TDGS method is turned to the physical similarity between data sequences from different channels, which are more independent of discharge parameters. The complexity arisen from real discharge parameters during data cleaning is avoided in the TDGS method by transforming the general data sorting problem into a binary classification problem about the physical similarity between data sequences. As a demonstration of its application to multi-channel measurement systems, the TDGS method is applied to the EAST POlarimeterINTerferometer (POINT) system. The optimal performance of the method evaluated by 24-fold cross-validation has reached 0.9871  0.0385.  2018",2019,2022-06-10 02:09:37,2022-07-31 03:14:52,,159-166,,,234,,Computer Physics Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier B.V.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.07.014,Cleaning; Machine learning; Classification (of information); Sorting; Metadata; Fusion reactors; Magnetism; Reliability analysis; Time domain analysis; Automatic data cleaning; Machine learning technique; Magnetic confinement fusion device; MUlti-channel measurement system; Time-domain global similarity; NEURAL-NETWORKS; INTERFEROMETER SYSTEM; LARGE HELICAL DEVICE; POLARIMETER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

The most important aspects, such as statistical features (Mean, Median, Min-Max and Standard Deviation), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI), are retrieved from the pre-processed data. Self Improved Standard Spider Monkey Optimization algorithm (SI-SMO) is used to select the most optimal features. Following that, a new improved deep learning model, the optimized Deep Belief Network, is used to simulate the covid-19 prediction phase (DBN).

To properly analyze data, it is important to maintain high-quality data. Thus, research on data cleaning is also important. It is difficult to automatically detect and correct inconsistent values for data requiring expert knowledge or data created by many contributors, such as integrated data from heterogeneous data sources. An example of such data is metadata for scientific datasets, which should be confirmed by data managers while handling the data. To support the efficient cleaning of data by data managers, we propose a data cleaning architecture in which data managers interactively browse and correct portions of data through views.

[Methodology] 31,888 academic articles in the journal ""PLOS ONE"" were selected. After data cleaning and segmentation, a text classification corpus containing 313,952 chapter structure category information was constructed. Based on traditional machine learning models NB, SVM, CRF, and the deep learning model RNN model group, Bi-LSTM model group, IDCNN model group, BERT model group, a total of 17 machine learning models were used to carry out chapter structure division experiment. [Results] Among the classification tasks, the BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF model has the best classification performance, with an average F value of 71.18%, which is 0.51% and 3.31% higher than the second CRF and the third Bi-LSTM-CRF, respectively. For deep learning models, the use of BERT for text representation is better than word2vec. Adding the Attention mechanism and replacing the Softmax layer with the CRF layer can achieve better classification results. In addition, the online version of the Chapter Structure Recognition Presentation and Application Platform has been developed, which can visually display the overall situation of the research and the model training process, and can realize machine learning and deep learning models such as NB, SVM, CRF, Bi-LSTM, IDCNN.

This has a significant impact on a broad range of applications that are characterized by massive working sets and real-time constraints. However, it is challenging and burdensome for human operators to hand-tune various control-knobs in a cloud-scale storage cluster for maintaining optimal performance under diverse workload conditions. Our study on an open-source object-based storage system, Ceph, shows that common load balancing strategies are ineffective unless they are adapted according to workload characteristics. Furthermore, positive effects of an applied strategy may not be immediately visible. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning based system adaptation technique that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks. In particular, we applied a stochastic policy gradient based reinforcement learning technique to track performance hotspots in the storage cluster, and take appropriate corrective actions to maximize future performance under a variety of complex scenarios. For this purpose, we leveraged system-level performance monitoring and commonly available control-knobs in object-based cloud storage systems. We implemented the developed techniques to build an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) system for object based storage cluster, and evaluated its performance on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed. Experiments using Cloud Object Storage Benchmark (COSBench) show that, ARM improves the average read and write response time of Ceph storage cluster by upto 50% and 33% respectively, compared to the default case. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic load rebalancing technique in terms of read and write performance of Ceph storage by 43% and 36% respectively.  2019 IEEE.",2019,2022-06-10 02:09:39,2022-07-31 03:53:28,,34-44,,,,,,,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering, IC2E 2019",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"Prague, Czech republic",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IC2E.2019.000-9,Open systems; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Cloud computing; Stochastic systems; Digital storage; Information management; Balancing; Dynamic loads; Knobs; Storage as a service (STaaS); Storage management; Task analysis; Hardware; Servers; Interference; Ceph; Cloud Storage; Load management; Performance Interference; Reinforcement Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

In order to better carry out personal credit scoring, we propose three criteria, power exponents of time interval distribution of individual user i, user activity Ai, and the ratio of out-degree and in-degree Ri of user i, which are used to systematically clean the data. And then, we used the logistic regression method to score the individual credits of users before and after data cleaning, and found that the rank order of personal credit scoring has changed significantly.

Based on this view, we present PClean, a unified generative modeling architecture for cleaning and normalizing dirty data in diverse domains. Given an unclean dataset and a probabilistic program encoding relevant domain knowledge, PClean learns a structured representation of the data as a relational database of interrelated objects, and uses this latent structure to impute missing values, identify duplicates, detect errors, and propose corrections in the original data table. PClean makes three modeling and inference contributions: (i) a domain-general non-parametric generative model of relational data, for inferring latent objects and their network of latent connections; (ii) a domain-specific probabilistic programming language, for encoding domain knowledge specific to each dataset being cleaned; and (iii) a domain-general inference engine that adapts to each PClean program by constructing data-driven proposals used in sequential Monte Carlo and particle Gibbs. We show empirically that short ( 50-line) PClean programs deliver higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data cleaning systems based on machine learning and weighted logic; that PCleans inference algorithm is faster than generic particle Gibbs inference for probabilistic programs; and that PClean scales to large real-world datasets with millions of rows.

In an attempt to guarantee data quality, various data cleaning approaches have been proposed to filter out abnormal data entries based on the global data distribution. However, most existing data cleaning approaches are based on a centralized paradigm and thus cannot be applied to future edge-based IoT applications, where each edge node (EN) has only a limited view of the global data distribution. Moreover, the increasing demand for privacy preservation largely prevents ENs from combining their data for centralized cleaning. In this study, we propose a federated data cleaning protocol, coined as FedClean, for edge intelligence (EI) scenarios that is designed to achieve data cleaning without compromising data privacy. More specifically, different ENs first generate Boolean shares of their data and distribute them to two noncolluding servers. These two servers then run the FedClean protocol to privately and efficiently compute the attribute value frequency (AVF) scores of the collected data entries, which are then sorted in ascending order via a bitonic sorting network without revealing their values.

In this context, the use of machine learning classification models to predict whether an employee is likely to quit could greatly increase the human resource department's ability to intervene on time and possibly provide a remedy to the situation to prevent attrition. This study is conducted with an objective to compare the performance machine learning techniques, namely, Decision Tree (DT) classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) classifier, and select the best model. These machine learning techniques are compared using the IBM Human Resource Analytic Employee Attrition and Performance dataset. Preprocessing steps for the dataset used in this comparative study include data exploration, data visualization, data cleaning and reduction, data transformation, discretization, and feature selection. In this study, parameter tuning and regularization techniques to overcome overfitting issues are applied for optimization purposes. The comparative study conducted on the three classifiers found that the optimized SVM model stood as the best model that can be used to predict employee attrition with the highest accuracy percentage of 88.87% as compared to the other classification models experimented with, followed by ANN and DT.  2021.

This study considers a total of 14 different mix design variables and predicts the ductility of HPFRCC for the first time, in addition to the compressive and tensile strengths. Different types of machine learning methods are investigated and compared, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The results show that the developed machine learning models can reasonably predict the concerned mechanical properties and can be applied to perform parametric studies for the effects of different mix design variables on the mechanical properties.

In this study, a deep learning method to repair atmospheric environmental quality data based on Gaussian diffusion and gate recurrent unit (GD-GRU) was developed to improve repair accuracy. A multi-source Gaussian diffusion model was developed to estimate PM2.5 based on the pollutant diffusion law and the data of 61 stations in Guilin. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated and observed value was extracted as the error sequence. The error value was regarded as output of gate recurrent unit (GRU) with the inputs of weather and pollutant parameters. Missing data were calculated by Gaussian diffusion estimated value and the error predicted by GRU. The established GD-GRU model was applied to repair the long-sequence missing data. The analytical results indicated that the GD-GRU model had higher prediction accuracy of extreme values than Gaussian diffusion model and GRU model, because GD-GRU based on Gaussian diffusion can calculate the extreme value by simulating the diffusion and transmission mechanism. The established model predicted PM2.5 concentration in the next hours with an RMSE of 12.561, which was approximately 21.02% better, on average, than methods like autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory model (LSTM), and GRU.

In this work, we present a new workflow to replace the human knowledge-based analogue studies with data analytics and machine learning techniques. First, we collect reservoir properties, development parameters, and historical recovery data for 1381 actual U.S. oilfields from Tertiary Oil Recovery Information System (TORIS) by U.S. Department of Energy. We conduct extensive data cleaning for outliers and missing values. Then, we determine the most important determining factors for recovery factors. We further use single-variable and bi-variable analysis to understand relationship between recovery factor and determining factors. Finally, we use train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to make recovery factors predictions. We have found that the recovery factors mostly depend on 19 principal factors, a reduction from a total of more than 70 properties originally in TORIS. We randomly select data from 90% of these oilfields as training set for machine learning. The predictability and accuracy of such methodology is tested by making recovery forecasts for the remaining 10% oilfields and by comparing the forecasts with the actual recovery factors. Eventually, the average error in recovery factor predicted by the trained ANN model is about 10%. Overall, this methodology has shown strong performance in computer assisted analogue study, which shows minimum requirements on human knowledge and hands-on work to study these 1381 oilfields. This work provides a new workflow of using data analytics and machine learning techniques for reservoir analogues studies. Reservoir engineering software systematically built based on this methodology can serve as more efficient and accurate predictive tool in studying reservoir analogues.

Part of the data preparation, standardization, and cleaning processes, such as data matching and deduplication for instance, could be automated by making a ML model 'learn' and predict the matches routinely. Data integration can also benefit from ML as the data to be integrated can be sampled and used to design the data integration algorithms. After the initial manual work to setup the labels, ML models can start learning from the new incoming data that are being submitted for standardization, integration, and cleaning. The more data supplied to the model, the better the ML algorithm can perform and deliver accurate results. Therefore, ML is more scalable compared to traditional and time-consuming approaches. Nevertheless, many ML algorithms require an out-of-The-box tuning and their parameters and scope are often not adapted to the problem at hand. To make an example, in cleaning and integration processes, the window sizes of values used for the ML models cannot be arbitrarily chosen and require an adaptation of the learning parameters.

Thus, the primary aim of fog devices is to ensure the authenticity of incoming network traffic. Anyhow, these fog devices are susceptible to malicious attacks. An efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is necessary to offer secure functioning of fog for improving efficiency. IDSs are a fundamental component for any security system like the Internet of things (IoT) and fog networks for ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS). Even though different machine learning and deep learning models have shown their efficiency in intrusion detection, the deep insight of managing the incremental data is a complex part. Therefore, the main intent of this paper is to implement an effective model for intrusion detection in a fog computing platform. Initially, the data dealing with intrusion are collected from diverse benchmark sources. Further, data cleaning is performed, which is to identify and remove errors and duplicate data, to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables accurate decision making. The conceptual and temporal features are extracted. Concerning reducing the data length for reducing the training complexity, optimal feature selection is performed based on an improved meta-heuristic concept termed Modified Active Electrolocation-based Electric Fish Optimization (MAE-EFO). With the optimally selected features or data, incremental learning-based detection is accomplished by Incremental Deep Neural Network (I-DNN). This deep learning model optimises the testing weight using the proposed MAE-EFO by concerning the objective as to minimise the error difference between the predicted and actual results, thus enhancing the performance of new incremental data. The validation of the proposed model on the benchmark datasets and other datasets achieves an attractive performance when compared over other state-of-the-art IDSs.  2022 World Scientific Publishing Co.",2022,2022-06-10 02:09:41,2022-07-31 05:01:00,,,,,,,,,Journal of Information and Knowledge Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: World Scientific,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219649222500423,Feature extraction; Internet of things; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Network security; Benchmarking; Optimization; Intrusion detection; Efficiency; Complex networks; Fish; Fog; Fog computing; Quality of service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

This combination, about four million stars, enables us to construct one of the largest training sample for the regression, and further predict reliable stellar temperatures with a root-mean-squared error of 191 K. This result is more precise than that given by Gaia second data release that is based on about sixty thousands stars. After a series of data cleaning processes, the input features that feed the regressor are carefully selected from the Gaia parameters, including the colors, the 3D position and the proper motion. These Gaia parameters is used to predict effective temperatures for 132,739,323 valid stars in the second Gaia data release.

Hyperparameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyperparmeter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.

However, it is difficult to detect the meaning and context relationship of some complex statements. In this paper, a new model is proposed to classify Chinese network sensitive information. The model, which is based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and latest pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers), is called the BERT-CNN deep learning model. Firstly, nearly 20,000 comments of corresponding videos are collected from YouTube, after data cleaning and labeling, the texts are divided into four categories to build the SLD (sensitive language detection) dataset. Finally, the word vectors from the pre-trained BERT are used as the input of the CNN model, constructing the Chinese sensitive information classifying BERT-CNN model. The result reveals that, compared with the traditional neural network model, the BERT-CNN model proposed in this paper improves the generalization ability of word embedding, and can effectively achieve the recognition and classification of the network sensitive information in short text dataset. The experimental results perform better than the classic CNN and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models.  2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2020,2022-06-10 02:10:18,2022-07-31 04:03:25,,269-280,,,1205 CCIS,,,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-5577-0_20,Classification (of information); Recurrent neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Text processing; Character recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Automatic and accurate tongue color classification is an important content of the objectification of tongue diagnosis. Due to the vagueness of the visual boundaries between different types of tongue colors and the subjectivity of the doctors, the annotated tongue image data samples often contain noises, which has a negative effect on the training of the tongue color classification model. Therefore, in this paper, a tongue color classification method in TCM with noisy labels is proposed. Firstly, a two-stage data cleaning method is proposed to identify and clean noisy labeled samples. Secondly, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the channel attention mechanism is designed in this paper to achieve accurate classification of tongue color by enhancing the expressiveness of features. Finally, a knowledge distillation strategy with a noise sample filtering mechanism is proposed. This strategy adds a noise sample filtering mechanism led by the teacher network to eliminate further noise samples. At the same time, the teacher network is used to guide the training of the light convolutional neural network to improve the classification performance.The experimental results on the self-established TCM tongue color classification dataset show that the proposed method in this paper can significantly improve the classification accuracy with lower computational complexity, reaching 93.88%.  2022, Science Press.

Out of the roughly 73,000,000 instances contained in this dataset, only about 0.013% represents normal traffic, which indicates that the issue of class imbalance should not be ignored for Bot-IoT. Our contribution includes several important findings based on works that address the imbalance in this dataset. In general, we noted the excellent performance of a diverse range of trained models.

Many of these are predestined to fail from the beginning. In traditional software engineering, this problem is addressed via a feasibility study, an indispensable step before developing any software system. In this paper, we present Snoopy, with the goal of supporting data scientists and machine learning engineers performing a systematic and theoretically founded feasibility study before building ML applications. We approach this problem by estimating the irreducible error of the underlying task, also known as the Bayes error rate (BER), which stems from data quality issues in datasets used to train or evaluate ML model artifacts. We design a practical Bayes error estimator that is compared against baseline feasibility study candidates on 6 datasets (with additional real and synthetic noise of different levels) in computer vision and natural language processing. Furthermore, by including our systematic feasibility study with additional signals into the iterative label cleaning process, we demonstrate in end-to-end experiments how users are able to save substantial labeling time and monetary efforts.

Data characteristics and challenges on various quality dimensions are identified and documented, keeping in mind the principles of transparency and explainability. The Data Readiness Report also serves as a record of all data assessment operations, including applied transformations. This provides a detailed lineage for data governance and management. In effect, the report captures and documents the actions taken by various personas in a data readiness and assessment workflow.

GPS data are typically collected by smartphones apps, which are restricted to small samples of the population. Cellular signaling data (CSD) are usually collected by mobile network operators, which enables researchers to conduct travel behavior analysis of the entire population at a relatively low cost compared to GPS. However, extracting travel mode information from CSD is particularly challenging due to the noise data and low positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a travel mode identification framework based on CSD, which includes data cleansing and travel mode identification. In terms of data cleansing, oscillation sequence and drift data are mainly cleansed. For the oscillation sequence, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on time window. For the drift data, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on distance, velocity and frequency. In terms of travel mode identification, the task is divided into two dichotomous problems: motor and non-motor transport identification and public and private transport identification. Each dichotomous problem proposes an algorithm that does not rely on the ground truth dataset for model training. Finally, a ground truth dataset is constructed to verify all algorithms. The result shows that, in terms of data cleansing, the similarity between CSD after cleansing and the actual trajectory according to DTW improved by 101.13% on average. In terms of travel mode identification, the proposed method can achieve similar or even better accuracy than traditional supervised-learning algorithms (94% in motor and non-motor transport identification, 83.5% in public and private transport identification), which can be directly applied to large-scale population analysis scenarios.  2022 Jiatao Chen et al.",2022,2022-06-10 02:10:22,2022-07-31 01:44:57,,,,,2022,,Mobile Information Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Hindawi Limited,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/2113213,Global positioning system; Population statistics; Signal detection; CLASSIFICATION; PHONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

However, inconsistency and incomplete information are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, and their impact on ML applications remains elusive. In this paper, we present a formal study of this impact by extending the notion of Certain Answers for Codd tables, which has been explored by the database research community for decades, into the field of machine learning. Specifically, we focus on classification problems and propose the notion of ""Certain Predictions"" (CP) - a test data example can be certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of all possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same prediction. We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines whether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the number of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given that general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without assumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP queries can be developed - we show that it is possible to answer both queries in linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds. We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of ""data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML)."" We show that our proposed CPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of classification accuracy with mild manual cleaning effort.

However, such multi-source heterogenous data typically contain low-quality data, e.g., missing values, which may result in potential risks. Besides, resource-constrained devices incur large latency in edge computing networks. To alleviate such latency, distributed task offloading schemes are designed to share the computation burden between edge nodes and nearby servers. However, there are three main drawbacks of such schemes. First, low-quality data are not carefully evaluated by constraints under scenarios, which may result in slow convergence in distributed computation. Second, multi-source data including sensitive information are computed and shared among edge nodes without privacy protection. Third, distributed tasks on low-quality data may result in low-quality results even with an optimal offloading scheme. To address the problems above, a task offloading framework for edge computing based on consortium blockchain and distributed reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which can provide high-quality task offloading policies with data privacy protected. This framework consists of three key components: data quality evaluation (DQ) with multiple data quality dimensions, data repairing (DR) with a repairing algorithm based on a novel repairing consensus mechanism and distributed reinforcement learning for task arrangement (DELTA) with a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm based on a novel low-quality data distributing strategy. Numeric results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed task offloading framework for edge computing on low-quality data in the IoE.  1983-2012 IEEE.",2022,2022-06-10 02:10:24,2022-07-31 14:42:37,,657-676,,2,40,,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3118417,Repair; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Quality control; Blockchain; Edge computing; Data privacy; Task analysis; Data integrity; Blockchains; consortium blockchain; data quality; distributed learning; Internet of energy; Organizations; task offloading; ALLOCATION; IOT; RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION; THINGS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Since a large amount of data from these systems is often of low quality, the training data needs to be interpreted and evaluated. While there have been some research efforts, they still have significant shortcomings, such as high computational complexity and impracticality. Considering the characteristics of the data, the interpretation of machine learning models allows for data cleansing, which can improve data quality and help regulators understand the decision-making process. In this paper, we propose an explainable vertical federated learning (EVFL) framework, including the credibility assessment strategy, the federated counterfactual explanation and the importance rate (IR) metric. Furthermore, we initialize the knowledge-based counterfactual instance based on prior knowledge and retrain the federated counterfactual method for feasible counterfactual features.

RSSI data were collected from the Dinamika Bangsa University Campus building, namely 225 reference points. The two main processes involved in data compilation, namely construction data and data cleaning. From the process of identifying a column containing a single RSSI value, several unique values were found in each column in the RSSI data table.

The output is 5969 rows and 3 columns. However, the number of columns that passed the Low Variance selection was 5969 rows and 18 columns, meaning that all columns in the dataset have high variance.

Additionally, effectively detecting the attacks in the wireless enterprise networks is one of todays most important and challenging problems, especially in Wi-Fi networks, as attacks become increasingly covert and diverse. Fortunately, WiFi networks produce large amounts of data, providing copious big data for researchers.

This study proposes innovative tools that allow researchers to answer these questions. We build these set of tools by utilizing the pattern recognition abilities of machine learning algorithms and public data from the Southwestern Pennsylvania region of the Marcellus Shale. By means of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, we studied a database that includes public data from more than 2,000 wells producing from the aforementioned study area. The database contained completion, drilling, and production history information from various operators active in Allegheny, Greene, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland counties located in the Southwestern Pennsylvania. Extensive preprocessing and data cleansing steps were involved to prepare the database. Various machine learning techniques (Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Gaussian Processes (GP)) were applied to understand the non-linear patterns in the data. The objective was to develop predictive models that were trained and validated based on the current database. The predictive models were validated using information originating from numerous wells in the area. Once validated, the model could be used in reservoir management decision-making workflows to answer questions such as what are the best drilling scenarios, the optimum hydraulic fracturing design, the initial production rate, and the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The workflow is purely based on field data and free of any cognitive human bias. As soon as more data is available, the model could be updated. The core data in this workflow is sourced from public domains, and therefore, intensive preprocessing efforts were necessary.  2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers.",2018,2022-06-10 02:10:26,2022-07-31 03:26:22,,,,,2018-October,,,,SPE Eastern Regional Meeting,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE),"Pittsburgh, PA, United states",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/191827-18erm-ms,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Decision making; Predictive analytics; Data mining; Database systems; Infill drilling; Reservoir management; Shale; Support vector regression; Well spacing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model to address the short-term trajectory prediction problem in Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) by application of machine learning methods. The proposed model consists of two parts: clustering-based preprocessing and Multi-Cells Neural Network (MCNN)-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering and data re-sampling, we applied principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of trajectory vector variable. Then, the trajectories are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using nested cross validation, MCNN model is trained to find out the appropriate prediction model of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each individual cluster cell. Finally, the predicted ETA for each new flight is generated in different cluster cells classified by decision trees. To assess the performance of MCNN model, the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is proposed as the comparison learning model, and K-means++ and DBSCAN are proposed as two comparison clustering models in preprocessing part. With real 4D trajectory data in Beijing TMA, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model MCNN with DBSCAN in preprocessing is the most effective and robust hybrid machine learning model, both in trajectory clustering and short-term 4D trajectory prediction. In addition, it can make an accurate trajectory prediction in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with regards to comparison models.  2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,2022-06-10 02:10:27,2022-07-30 22:34:19,,280-294,,,95,,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.019,Machine learning; Learning systems; Neural networks; Decision trees; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Information management; Data mining; Air traffic control; Mean square error; Linear regression; Air transportation; Cells; Cytology; K-means clustering; Time of arrival; Trajectories; Clustering; 4D trajectory prediction; Air traffic management; Multi-cells neural network; TRAJECTORY PREDICTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Noise parameters are used to vary the total level of class noise and the proportion of class noise between the majority and minority classes. This allows us to better understand how class noise affects imbalanced data sets and where data cleaning efforts should be focused. Four popular machine learning algorithms are evaluated using six rounds of five-fold cross-validation to determine which learners are most robust to class noise. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) results shows that negative class noise, i.e. when positive instances are incorrectly labeled as negative, has the greatest adverse effect on classification performance. Statistical results show that the XGBoost learner performs significantly better than Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression Learners. True positive rates and true negative rates show that there is a trade-off that occurs as the noise proportion switches between the majority and negative classes.

In this paper, we study Federated Bilevel Optimization problems. Specifically, we first propose the FedBiO, a deterministic gradient-based algorithm and we show it requires O(2) number of iterations to reach an -stationary point. Then we propose FedBiOAcc to accelerate FedBiO with the momentum-based variance-reduction technique under the stochastic scenario. We show FedBiOAcc has complexity of O(1.5). Finally, we validate our proposed algorithms via the important Fair Federated Learning task. More specifically, we define a bilevel-based group fair FL objective. Our algorithms show superior performances compared to other baselines in numerical experiments.  2022, CC BY.",2022,2022-06-10 02:10:31,2022-07-31 05:36:49,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: arXiv,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.01608,Machine learning; Learning algorithms; Stochastic systems; Optimization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

The typical practice is to create 'clean' data for analysis, matching entities and merging variants to overcome differences in knowledge representation. Despite progress in data management techniques to automate this process, it still needs labor-intensive supervision from the analyst. In this paper, we evaluate the benefit of advanced statistical tools to address directly many analytic tasks across data sources without such entity-matching cleaning. Reframing analytical questions as machine-learning tasks enables to replace exact matching of entities by continuous descriptions-vectorial embeddings- that expose similarities between entries. But are analyses with less cleaning trustworthy? We answer this question with a thorough benchmark on questions typical of socio-economic studies across 14 employee databases: we compare the approaches based on machine learning to manual data cleaning (entity matching). It reveals that using embeddings and machine learning improves results validity (smaller estimation error) more than manual cleaning, with considerably less human labor. While machine learning is often combined with data management for the purpose of cleaning, our study suggests that using it directly for analysis is beneficial because it captures ambiguities hard to represent during curation.  2013 IEEE.",2022,2022-06-10 02:10:31,2022-07-31 03:31:02,,42420-42431,,,10,,IEEE Access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168013,Cleaning; Machine learning; Data integration; Embeddings; Information analysis; Job analysis; Statistical mechanics; data integration; data cleaning; Sociology; Task analysis; Manuals; Data analysis; embeddings; entity-matching; Remuneration; Soft sensors; DATA INTEGRATION; DETERMINANTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

However, ML models often assume the table structure keeps fixed in training and testing. Before ML modeling, heavy data cleaning is required to merge disparate tables with different columns. This preprocessing often incurs significant data waste (e.g., removing unmatched columns and samples). How to learn ML models from multiple tables with partially overlapping columns? How to incrementally update ML models as more columns become available over time? Can we leverage model pretraining on multiple distinct tables? How to train an ML model which can predict on an unseen table? To answer all those questions, we propose to relax fixed table structures by introducing a Transferable Tabular Transformer (TransTab) for tables. The goal of TransTab is to convert each sample (a row in the table) to a generalizable embedding vector, and then apply stacked transformers for feature encoding. One methodology insight is combining column description and table cells as the raw input to a gated transformer model. The other insight is to introduce supervised and self-supervised pretraining to improve model performance. We compare TransTab with multiple baseline methods on diverse benchmark datasets and five oncology clinical trial datasets. Overall, TransTab ranks 1.00, 1.00, 1.78 out of 12 methods in supervised learning, feature incremental learning, and transfer learning scenarios, respectively; and the proposed pretraining leads to 2.3% AUC lift on average over the supervised learning.  2022, CC BY.",2022,2022-06-10 02:10:31,2022-07-31 03:51:44,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: arXiv,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.09328,Machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Therefore, probabilistic (weak) labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called Chef (CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than one big batch of samples. This yields better overall model performance and enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

For this reason, source separation algorithms have become an increasingly important tool in neuroscience and neuroengineering. However, in noisy or highly multivariate recordings these decomposition techniques often make a large number of errors, which degrades human-machine interfacing applications and often requires costly post-hoc manual cleaning of the output label set of spike timestamps. To address both the need for automated post-hoc cleaning and robust separation filters we propose a methodology based on deep metric learning, using a novel loss function which maintains intra-class variance, creating a rich embedding space suitable for both label cleaning and the discovery of new activations. We then validate this method with an artificially corrupted label set based on source-separated high-density surface electromyography recordings, recovering the original timestamps even in extreme degrees of feature and class-dependent label noise. This approach enables a neural network to learn to accurately decode neurophysiological time series using any imperfect method of labelling the signal.  2021, CC BY-SA.",2021,2022-06-10 02:10:33,2022-07-31 14:18:55,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: arXiv,,,,Blind source separation; Cleaning; Deep learning; Neurophysiology; Non-negative matrix factorization; Time series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

As machine learning is used in sensitive applications, it becomes imperative that the trained model is accurate, fair, and robust to attacks. While many techniques have been proposed to improve the model training process (in-processing approach) or the trained model itself (post-processing), we argue that the most effective method is to clean the root cause of error: the data the model is trained on (pre-processing). Historically, there are at least three research communities that have been separately studying this problem: data management, machine learning (model fairness), and security. Although a significant amount of research has been done by each community, ultimately the same datasets must be preprocessed, and there is little understanding how the techniques relate to each other and can possibly be integrated. We contend that it is time to extend the notion of data cleaning for modern machine learning needs.

The fundamental idea is to treat the data points with label noise as outliers of the class indicated by the corresponding noisy label. This essentially allows us to deal with the traditional supervised problem of classification with label noise as an unsupervised one, i.e., identifying outliers from each class. However, finding such dubious observations (outliers) from each class is challenging in general. We therefore propose to reduce their potential influence using class-specific feature learning by autoencoder. Particularly, we learn for each class a feature space using all the samples labeled as that class, including those with noisy (but unknown to us) labels. Furthermore, in order to solve the situation when the noise is relatively high, we propose a weighted class-specific autoencoder by considering the effect of each data point on the postulated model. To fully exploit the advantage of the learned class-specific feature space, we use a minimum reconstruction error based method for finding out the outliers (label noise) and solving the classification task. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance on the task of data cleaning and classification with noisy labels.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,2022-06-10 02:10:34,2022-07-31 04:31:42,,1845-1860,,2,50,,Neural Processing Letters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-018-9963-9,"Cleaning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Statistics; Data cleaning; Classification; Outliers; Data cleaning, Outliers, Classification, Class-specific autoencoder, Label noise; Label noise; Class-specific autoencoder; MISCLASSIFICATION",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

The role of the financial market in environmental protection has gradually become the consensus of the financial community. Although the total amount of environmental protection investment in China shows a growing trend, the actual environmental protection investment still has a large gap compared with the increasing capital demand for environmental protection work. Financial resources play a key role in resource allocation. As long as funds are gradually withdrawn from polluting industries, they will be more invested in green and environmental industries, and resources such as land and labor will be optimally allocated. Faced with the complex international and domestic economic environment and increasing environmental pressures, this article proposes the green intelligent financial system construction paradigm based on deep learning and concurrency models. The deep learning model specialized on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is applied to preprocess the information, the data cleaning and vision models are integrated to extract the structure data.

Such process of information mining should be built on the basis of pre-processing, including data cleaning, aligning, segmentation and so on. In this paper, we mainly focus on an efficient algorithm to accurately segment time sequences in hydrology domain. Although traditional methods of time series segmentation can segment time series easily, there are three drawbacks in traditional methods; First, traditional segmentation methods pay more attention to the evaluation of the compression ratio and the fitting rate, but ignore the accuracy of segmentation points; Secondly, traditional segmentation methods do not take the information of time series data itself into account, such as it is easy to divide a whole time series into two time series segments, which leads to losing semantic information in time series analysis. Finally, in these traditional evaluations of time series segmentation, the number of segments and the position of the segmentation points are not comprehensively taken into account. In this paper, we propose a time series segmentation method based on Bi-LG-LSTM neural network, which is modified on the base of the LSTM/Bi-LSTM neural network. Through the supervised learning method on flood flow data sets, we can extract a large number of effective segments of the time series. Meanwhile, we propose a novel evaluation method, which utilizes the dynamic DTW distance method to evaluate the results of the time series segmentation method. The evaluation method takes the position of segmentation points and the number of time series segments into consideration.

Currently, data cleaning is mainly done manually, which is time-consuming. The existing methods for automatically relabeling OARs remain unpractical with real patient data, due to the inconsistent delineation and similar small-volume OARs. This paper proposes an improved data augmentation technique according to the characteristics of clinical data. Besides, a novel 3D non-local convolutional neural network is proposed, which includes a decision making network with voting strategy. The resulting model can automatically identify OARs and solve the problems in existing methods, achieving the accurate OAR re-labeling goal.

2QDG3YB8,journalArticle,2019.0,"Bahrami, Sepideh","Global Ensemble Streamflow and Flood Modeling with Application of Large Data Analytics, Deep learning and GIS",,,,,,"Flooding is one of the most dangerous natural disasters that repeatedly occur globally, and flooding frequently leads to major urban, financial, anthropogenic, and environmental impacts in the subjected area. Therefore, developing flood susceptibility maps to identify flood zones in the catchment is necessary for improved flood management and decision making. Streamflow and flood forecasting can provide important information for various applications including optimization of water resource allocations, water quality assessment, cost analysis, sustainable design of hydrological infrastructures, improvement in agriculture and irrigation practices. Compared to conventional or physically based hydrological modeling, which needs a large amount of historical data and parameters, the recent data-driven models which require limited amounts of data, have received growing attention among researchers due to their high predictive performance. This makes them more appropriate for hydrological forecasting in basin-scale and data-scarce regions. In this context, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of various data-driven modeling approaches in flood and streamflow forecasting. One of the significant desires in daily streamflow prediction in todayaEs world is recognizing possible indicators and improving their applicability for effective water management strategies. In this context, the authors proposed an ensemble data mining algorithm coupled with various machine learning methods to perform data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, and feature subset selection. To perform the task of data mining, three data cleaning approaches: Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Tensor Flow (TF) and Tensor Flow K-means clustering(TF-k-means clustering) have been used. For the feature selection, four different machine learning approaches including K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap aggregating, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machin (SVM) have been investigated. Out of twelve different combinations of data mining and machine learning, the best ensemble model was TF-k-means clustering coupled with RF, which outperformed the other methods with 96.52% classification accuracy.Thereafter, a modified Nonlinear Echo State Networks Multivariate Polynomial (NESN-MP) named in the current study as Robust Nonlinear Echo State Network (RNESN) was utilized for daily streamflow forecasting. The RNESN decreases the size of the reservoir (hidden layer which performs random weigh initialization), reduces the computational burden compared with NESN-MP, and increases the interactions between the internal states. The model is thus simple and user-friendly with better learning ability and more accurate forecasting performance. The method has been tested with data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center (NOAA) and Daymet Data Set from NASA through the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS). Each data set includes the daily records of the local observed hydrological and large-scale weather/climate variability parameters. The efficiency of the proposed method has been evaluated in three regions namely Berkshire County (MA), Tuolumne County (CA), and Wasco County (OR). These basins were designated based upon the wide range of climatic conditions across the US that they represent. The simulation results were compared with NESN-MP and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The results validate the superiority of the proposed modeling approach compared to NESN-MP and ANFIS. The proposed RNESN approaches outperform the other methods with an RMSE = 0.98.For flood forecasting, an Evidential Belief Function (EBF) model, both as an individual model and in combination with Logistic Regression (LR) methods, has been proposed to prepare the flood susceptibility map. In in this study, we proposed a new ensemble of models of Bootstrap aggregating as a Meta classifier based upon the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) functions including coarse, cosine, cubic and weighted as base classifiers to perform spatial prediction of the flood. We first selected 10 conditioning factors to spatial prediction of floods and then their prediction capability using the relief-F attribute evaluation (RFAE) method was assessed. Model validation was performed using two statistical error-indexes and the area under the curve (AUC). Results concluded that the Bootstrap aggregating -cubic KNN ensemble model outperformed the other ensemble models. Therefore, the Bootstrap aggregating -cubic KNN model can be used as a promising technique for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas. Furthermore, the AUC results indicated that the EBF, EBF from LR, EBF-LR (enter), and EBF-LR (stepwise) success rates were 94.61%, 67.94%, 86.45%, and 56.31%, respectively, and the prediction rates were 94.55%, 66.41%, 83.19%, and 52.98%. The results showed that the EBF model had the highest accuracy in predicting the flood susceptibility map, in which 14% of the total areas were located in high and very high susceptibility classes and 62% were located in low and very low susceptibility classes.

Traditional approaches focus on using string metrics to calculate the matching scores of recorded pairs or employing the machine learning technique with hand-crafted features. However, the effectiveness of these methods largely depends on designing good domain-specific metric methods or extracting discriminative features with rich domain knowledge. Also, traditional learning-based methods usually ignore the discrepancy between citations fields. In this paper, to decrease the impact of information gaps between different fields and fully take advantage of semantical and contextual information in each field, we present a novel joint multi-field siamese recurrent architecture. In particular, our method employs word-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for the fields with the strong relevance between each word and character-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the fields with the weak relevance between each word, which can exploit each fields temporal information effectively. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our model can learn discriminative features and outperforms several baseline methods and other RNN-based methods.

As artificial intelligence continues to develop, data-driven machine learning method can establish a robust model based on massive data to clarify development risks and challenges, predict development dynamic characteristics in advance. This study gathers over 15 years actual data from targeted carbonate reservoir and establishes a robust Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network prediction model based on correlation analysis, data cleaning, feature variables selection, hyper-parameters optimization and model evaluation to forecast oil production, gas-oil ratio (GOR), and water cut (WC) of WAG flooding. In comparison to traditional reservoir numerical simulation (RNS), LSTM neural networks have a huge advantage in terms of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The calculation time of LSTM method is 864% less than reservoir numerical simulation method, while prediction error of LSTM method is 261% less than RNS method. We classify producers into three types based on the prediction results and propose optimization measures aimed at the risks and challenges they faced. Field implementation indicates promising outcome with better reservoir support, lower GOR, lower WC, and stabler oil production.

As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learningbased data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.

Hidden patterns in accidents can be extracted so as to find the common features between accidents.

These datasets collected from police stations are heterogeneous. Incomplete and erroneous values are corrected using data cleaning measures, and relevance attributes are identified using attribute selection measures. Clusters that are formed using K-medoids, and expectation maximization algorithms are then analyzed to discover hidden patterns using a priori algorithm.

Globally, a significant amount of energy is consumed in residential buildings, i.e., 30-40% of total energy consumption. An active energy prediction system is highly desirable for efficient energy production and utilization. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to predict short-term energy consumption in a residential building. The proposed methodology consisted of four different layers, namely data acquisition, preprocessing, prediction, and performance evaluation. For experimental analysis, real data collected from 4 multi-storied buildings situated in Seoul, South Korea, has been used. The collected data is provided as input to the data acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer afterwards, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes are applied to the input data for the removal of abnormalities. Preprocessing further consisted of two processes, namely the computation of statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) and data normalization. In the prediction layer, the feed forward back propagation neural network has been used on normalized data and data with statistical moments. In the performance evaluation layer, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) have been used to measure the performance of the proposed approach. The average values for data with statistical moments of MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are 4.3266, 11.9617, and 5.4625 respectively.

High frequency time series data (typically one data point per second) from multiple sensors on a drilling rig is processed and labeled with drilling states including: slide drilling, rotate drilling, pick up, in slips, and others. With labeled time-series data, the real-time system can derive operational KPIs (key performance indicators) with extremely high resolution, e.g., a statistical summary of rotary versus slide drilling time for the rig supervisor and drilling engineer to analyze efficiency. Later, such information can be leveraged to develop algorithms to detect abnormal drilling events and drive closed loop control. A workflow was developed to clean and fill in any missing data. A rules-based model was then applied to classify the data into seventeen rig states. For the state ""drilling"", a sub-classification was made to label rotate drilling and slide drilling. However, it is difficult to categorize ""slide drilling"" solely based on surface RPM due to top drive oscillation. In order to achieve acceptable accuracies, three machine learning models to classify ""rotate drilling"" and ""slide drilling"" were evaluated: Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network / Recurrent Neural Network (CNN/RNN). Machine learning models were built for two basins, one model each, to accommodate different drilling styles. For the Delaware Basin, 10 wells with 9 million rows of data were chosen, and for the DJ Basin, 12 wells with 2 million rows of data were chosen. A legacy, rules-based algorithm was applied to label each row as rotate or slide drilling, and the misclassified records were manually corrected. The machine learning models were found to be far superior to rules-based models. For the wells in the training set, the accuracies of our rules-based models were 70% and 90% respectively, while the accuracies of our machine learning models were over 99%. The CNN model was proven to be the best model, excelling with high accuracy, short computation time, and scalability for big data applications. The data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning algorithm has been deployed in Anadarko's Real-Time Drilling (RTD) ecosystem (Cao et al., 2018, 2019), which consists of four layers: a data source, analytics, data storage, and UI layer. KPIs, directional statistics, and engineering models are calculated in real-time and visualized through a web-based UI. This system can be accessed by any member of the drilling operations team. The system is regularly used to evaluate, compare, and optimize well performance.

The rainfall data is normally collected hourly, and because there are many sensor locations, it is hard to maintain these sensors. The sensor data can be lost transiently and/or may yield anomaly values. Since there is a lot of data flowing to the server every day, it is hard to inspect manually or even semi-manually. This project collaborates with HII to develop a system that automates the rainfall data quality improvement process. The machine learning algorithms are used as tools for data cleansing. The derived data can be exposed as an open data set for many developers to explore new innovations. We explore data set characteristics and adopt both statistical and machine learning methods.

Training of the models was performed using image data available on the Internet, while database development included data cleansing by expert agronomists, basic image editing, and data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning applications in order to expand the rather limited amount of available data. Three fungi diseases, two pests and three nutrient deficiencies were included in the identification system, together with healthy plants identification. The final model reached a performance of 90.79% in successfully identifying cannabis diseases (or healthy plants) in previously ""unseen"" plant images. The most difficult cannabis problems to be identified were powdery mildew and potassium deficiency. Results showed that transfer learning from existing models specialized in similar tasks to the one under development, is more successful than using transfer learning from more general models. Finally, even though the amount of training images in some of the considered problems was significantly small, no correlation between model performance and the size of the training dataset for each category was found.

Thus, it is difficult to provide accurate local wear predictions in a timely manner. Data-driven approaches provide a more computationally efficient way to approximate the CFD wear predictions without running the actual CFD wear models. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach, termed WearGP, is presented to approximate the 3D local wear predictions, using numerical wear predictions from steady-state CFD simulations as training and testing datasets. The proposed framework is built on Gaussian process (GP) and utilized to predict wear in a much shorter time. The WearGP framework can be segmented into three stages. At the first stage, the training dataset is built by using a number of CFD simulations in the order of O(102). At the second stage, the data cleansing and data mining processes are performed, where the nodal wear solutions are extracted from the solution database to build a training dataset. At the third stage, the wear predictions are made, using trained GP models. Two CFD case studies including 3D slurry pump impeller and casing are used to demonstrate the WearGP framework, in which 144 training and 40 testing data points are used to train and test the proposed method, respectively. The numerical accuracy, computational efficiency and effectiveness between the WearGP framework and CFD wear model for both slurry pump impellers and casings are compared. It is shown that the WearGP framework can achieve highly accurate results that are comparable with the CFD results, with a relatively small size training dataset, with a computational time reduction on the order of 105 to 106.  2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2022-06-10 02:10:41,2022-07-31 03:36:59,,9-26,,,422-423,,Wear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2018.12.081,Machine learning; Learning systems; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Data mining; Computational efficiency; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Computational fluid dynamics; Impellers; Pumps; Slurry pipelines; Wear of materials; Gaussian process; Multiphase computational fluid dynamics; Slurry pump; Wear; MODEL; PARTICLE EROSION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Typically, silt (32128m) and sand (1281000m) sized grains will be characterized under an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope. In both cases, it is a tedious and costly process. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an original computational approach in order to automate mineral grains recognition from numerical images obtained with a simple optical microscope. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the current computer vision based on machine learning algorithms is tested for the automated recognition of such mineral grains. In more details, this work uses the simple linear iterative clustering segmentation to generate superpixels and many of them allow isolating sand grains, which is not possible with classical segmentation methods. Also, the approach has been tested using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs did not give as good results as the superpixels method. The superpixels are also exploited to extract features related to a sand grain. These image characteristics form the raw dataset. Prior to proceed with the classification, a data cleaning stage is necessary to get a usable dataset for machine learning algorithms.

Although some models have been developed to predict linear or conformational B-cell epitopes, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Hundreds of thousands of linear B-cell epitope data have accumulated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). These data can be explored using the deep learning methods, in order to create better predictive models for linear B-cell epitopes. Results: After data cleaning, we obtained 240,563 peptide samples with experimental evidence from the IEDB database, including 25,884 linear B-cell epitopes and 214,679 non-epitopes. Based on the peptide center, we adapted each peptide to the same length by trimming or extending. A random portion of the data, with the same amount of epitopes and non-epitopes, were set aside as test dataset. Then a same number of epitopes and non-epitopes were randomly selected from the remaining data to build a classifier with the feedforward deep neural network. We built eleven classifiers to form an ensemble prediction model. The model will report a peptide as an epitope if it was classified as epitope by all eleven classifiers. Then we used the test data set to evaluate the performance of the model using the area value under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as an indicator. We established 40 models to predict linear B-cell epitopes of length from 11 to 50 separately, and found that the AUC value increased with the length and tended to be stable when the length was 38. Repeated results showed that the models constructed by this method were robust. Tested on our and two public test datasets, our models outperformed current major models available. Conclusions: We applied the feedforward deep neural network to the large amount of linear B-cell epitope data with experimental evidence in the IEDB database, and constructed ensemble prediction models with better performance than the current major models available.

Prediction of electrical loads and scheduling the generation resources to match the demand enable the utility to mitigate the energy generation cost. Different methodologies have been employed to predict energy consumption at different levels of distribution and transmission systems. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict energy consumption in smart buildings. The proposed framework consists of two stages, namely, data cleaning, and model building. The data cleaning phase applies pre-processing techniques to the raw data and adds additional features of lag values. In the model-building phase, the hybrid model is trained on the processed data. The hybrid deep learning (DL) model is based on the stacking of fully connected layers, and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) on bi-directional LSTMs. The proposed model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies of energy consumption on dependent features and to be effective in terms of computational complexity, training time, and forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark energy consumption datasets yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy when compared with widely used hybrid models such as Convolutional (Conv) Neural Network-LSTM, ConvLSTM, LSTM encoder-decoder model, stacking models, etc. A mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.00% for case study 1 and a MAPE of 3.71% for case study 2 is obtained for the proposed forecasting DL model in comparison with LSTM-based models that yielded 7.80% MAPE and 5.099% MAPE for two datasets respectively.

Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of at least 3.3% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (51% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled, on average across the datasets). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy  our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%.

MDJCYGRU,journalArticle,2021.0,"Olabanjo, Olusola A.; Aribisala, Benjamin S.; Mazzara, Manuel; Wusu, Ashiribo S.",An ensemble machine learning model for the prediction of danger zones: Towards a global counter-terrorism,Soft Computing Letters,,26662221,10.1016/j.socl.2021.100020,,"Terrorism can be described as the use of violence against persons or properties to intimidate or coerce a government or its citizens to some certain political or social objectives. It is a global problem which has led to loss of lives and properties and known to have negative impacts on tourism and global economy. Terrorism has also been associated with high level of insecurity and most nations of the world are interested in any research efforts that can reduce its menace. Most of the research efforts on terrorism have focused on measures to fight terrorism or how to reduce the activities of terrorists but there are limited efforts on terrorism prediction. The aim of this work is to develop an ensemble machine learning model which combines Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor for prediction of continents susceptible to terrorism. Data was obtained from Global Terrorism Database and data preprocessing included data cleaning and dimensionality reduction. Two feature selection techniques, Chi-squared, Information Gain and a hybrid of both were applied to the dataset before modeling. Ensemble machine learning models were then constructed and applied on the selected features. Chi-squared, Information Gain and the hybrid-based features produced an accuracy of 94.17%, 97.34% and 97.81% respectively at predicting danger zones with respective sensitivity scores of 82.3%, 88.7% and 92.2% and specificity scores of 98%, 90.5% and 99.67% respectively. These imply that the hybrid-based selected features produced the best results among the feature selection techniques at predicting terrorism locations. Our results show that ensemble machine learning model can accurately predict terrorism locations.  2021 The Author(s)",2021,2022-06-10 02:10:42,2022-07-31 02:21:06,,,,,3,,Soft Computing Letters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier B.V.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socl.2021.100020,Support vector machines; Forecasting; Feature extraction; Nearest neighbor search; Terrorism; Danger zones; Ensemble machine learning; Support vector machine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

This issue may seriously affect the data quality in some fields, such as transportation. A typical IoT application in transportation is electronic registration identification of the motor vehicle (ERI), an emerging traffic data acquisition technology based on RFID. ERI data play a vital role in intelligent transportation. However, the data quality is often affected seriously by the inaccurate timestamps, which arise from the time-unsynchronized distributed ERI readers. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, data repairing of time synchronization problems (DR-TSP), which can detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and correct timestamp-deviated ERI data. Precisely, DR-TSP consists of three components. Problem reader discovery component employs a statistics-based method to detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and discovers the clock leaps of the problematic ERI reader through a smoothing-based method. Travel-time estimation component constructs a spatial correlative travel-time estimation model based on the neural network to infer timestamp deviation. The influence of clock deviation is considered in the model training. Data correction component utilizes the above results to correct the timestamp-deviated data. Experiments over large-scale ERI data collected from a big China city, Chongqing, show that our method can significantly improve data quality.  2014 IEEE.",2021,2022-06-10 02:10:42,2022-07-31 14:06:44,,11666-11677,,14,8,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3058640,Technology transfer; Internet of things; Advanced traffic management systems; Data acquisition; Clocks; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Synchronization; Travel time; Internet of Things; Data models; Roads; Sensors; Data cleaning and repairing; radio-frequency identification (RFID); Radiofrequency identification; time synchronization problem; travel-time estimation model; OUTLIER DETECTION; THINGS; INTERNET,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

The time-series analysis is performed by transforming data into a common domain for clustering. The data are collected from a tugboat to investigate the correlation between environmental and location data with fuel consumption to achieve fuel efficiency. The relevant parameters that influence the fuel consumption of the tugboat, such as fuel consumption, vessel route, vessel speed and wind metrics are collected from sensors installed onboard the ship and data provider to monitor and to gauge the vessel's performance. The raw readings are conditioned (data cleaning and data pre-processing) before transformation to Score Dataset: the Raw mass-flowrate readings are cleaned by using the Haar wavelet; the wind raw reading is converted to wind effect data; the Location data is converted to vessel speed data. Together, they form a Score Dataset by applying the time series K-means clustering. The subsequent unsupervised learning identifies the activity labels that describe qualitatively the operations of the vessels and are obtained by using the non-time series K-mean clustering. By using the Hidden Markov Model approach, this paper attempts to explain the stochastic correlation among parameters explained earlier. The correlation is the information of newly discovered knowledge in terms of likelihood matrices, also known as the knowledge base (KB). The KB may be consumed to perform predictions. Hence, it is possible to suggest the optimal ship operation, i.e., speed that produces the optimum fuel consumption. The Score Dataset and clustering that are produced in this paper could also be used in the Artificial Neural Network for future work.

To support growing planning and control decision-making, the need for large numbers of short-term load forecasts has emerged. Data-driven modelling of medium voltage feeders can be affected by (1) data quality issues, namely, large gross errors and missing observations (2) the presence of structural breaks in the data due to occasional network reconfiguration and load transfers. The present work investigates and reports on the effects of advanced data cleansing techniques on forecast accuracy. A hybrid framework to detect and remove outliers in large datasets is proposed; this automatic procedure combines the Tukey labelling rule and the binary segmentation algorithm to cleanse data more efficiently, it is fast and easy to implement. Various approaches for missing value imputation are investigated, including unconditional mean, Hot Deck via k-nearest neighbour and Kalman smoothing. A combination of the automatic detection/removal of outliers and the imputation methods mentioned above are implemented to cleanse time series of 342 medium-voltage feeders. A nested rolling-origin-validation technique is used to evaluate the feed-forward deep neural network models. The proposed data cleansing framework efficiently removes outliers from the data, and the accuracy of forecasts is improved. It is found that Hot Deck (k-NN) imputation performs best in balancing the bias-variance trade-off for short-term forecasting.  2019",2020,2022-06-10 02:10:43,2022-07-31 04:32:16,,,,,261,,Applied Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114405,Anomaly detection; Forecasting; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Economic and social effects; Electric power plant loads; Feeding; Outlier detection; Binary segmentation; Distribution systems; Kalman smoothing; Multi-step forecasts; PERFORMANCE; TIME-SERIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Google traces are dump tables that contain raw data about data center servers, workload jobs and tasks status, workload demands, data center provisioned resources and hardware reconfiguration. Machine learning considers input data set and output data set as a training learning model by relating these two correlated sets as normalized values for future use. In this work, a data cleaning and full analysis for Google data center traces have been done to be used in deep machine learning models, like conventional neural network or recurrent neural network with capability of using inline learning model. Data set are processed by re-normalizing resources capacities and workloads demands (jobs and tasks), and by removing or transforming non-Available and opaque values into useful values. A novel correlation between input and output data sets for Google traces is introduced that relates workload demands with data center resources reconfiguration, and data center resources with data center capacity. The idea is to connect between demands and provisioned resources by evaluating the cloud data center configuration sets, which allows cloud manager to provision resources by setting up the best reconfiguration in scaling cloud data center.

The current measures for image monitoring of icing overhead power lines rely on manual observation. There is an urgent need for image intelligent analysis methods with strong generalisation, accuracy, and efficiency to improve power grid decision-making. Based on the icing monitoring data from China Southern Power Grid, this paper first proposes rules for insulator image data cleaning, classification, and annotation, establishing a dataset of insulator icing monitoring images during 20142018. Then, based on Yolo (You only look once) v5, a weakly supervised and phased transfer learning method is proposed to recognise insulators and ice types such as snow, rime, mixed rime, glaze, and the normal. This method reduces the interference of icing background, uneven illumination, and camera occlusion through multidimensional feature fusion. The precision, recall, and mean average precision of the recognition can reach 86.6%, 91.3%, and 90.1%, respectively, and the recognition speed is as fast as 8ms/image. Using image pseudo-labelling based on weakly supervised learning enables the intellectualisation of image annotation, which significantly changes the inefficiency of manual labelling. 2022 The Authors.

For a given dataset and data analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal result quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start with or which methods to use. Most current work can be classified into two categories: (1) they propose new data cleaning algorithms specific to certain types of data anomalies usually considered in isolation and without a ""pipeline vision"" of the entire data preprocessing strategy; (2) they develop automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of a considered ML model with a list of by-default preprocessing methods.

First, we propose the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level labels.

However, most of existing AutoML pipelines only touch parts of the full machine learning pipeline, e.g., neural architecture search or optimizer selection. This leaves potentially important components such as data cleaning and model ensemble out of the optimization, and still results in considerable human involvement and suboptimal performance. The main challenges lie in the huge search space assembling all possibilities over all components, as well as the generalization ability over different tasks like image, text, and tabular etc. In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind fully AutoML pipeline, to comprehensively automate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model generation/selection/training and ensemble for an arbitrary dataset and evaluation metric. Our innovation lies in the comprehensive scope of a learning pipeline, with a novel 'life-long' knowledge anchor design to fundamentally accelerate the search over the full search space.

YQNS9IJ5,journalArticle,2018.0,"Pansare, Niketan; Dusenberry, Michael; Jindal, Nakul; Boehm, Matthias; Reinwald, Berthold; Sen, Prithviraj",Deep learning with apache SystemML,,,23318422,,,"Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on learning hierarchical representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction using neural networks [15]. Recent advances in deep learning are made possible due to the availability of large amounts of labeled data, use of GPGPU compute, and application of new techniques (such as ReLU, batch normalization [12], dropout [17], residual block [10], etc.) that help deal with issues in training deep networks. In spite of the need to train on large datasets, there is a disconnect between the deep learning community and the big data community. To scale to a multi-node cluster, most deep learning frameworks (such as Caffe2, TensorFlow [2] and IBM's PowerAI DDL [6]) use custom communication libraries based on either MPI (such as IBM Spectrum MPI, Facebook's Gloo) or a custom networking protocol(such as Google RPC). Unlike popular big data frameworks (such as Apache Hadoop [9] and Apache Spark [18]), these communication libraries do not provide features such as resource sharing, multi-tenancy and fault-tolerance out of the box, making them difficult to deploy on shared production clusters. This leads to ineffective use of resources in an organization, often requiring two separate infrastructures (i.e. scale-up versus scale-out). This problem is even more severe when the data generated as part of the big data pipeline (ML, data preprocessing, data cleaning) needs to be consumed by the deep learning pipeline or vice versa, as the workload characteristics of a typical machine learning algorithm (i.e. memory-bound, BLAS level-2, sparse/ultrasparse inputs (or feature matrix), etc.) are often different than that of a typical deep learning algorithm (i.e. compute-bound, BLAS level-3, dense inputs, etc.). Apache SystemML [4] aims to bridge that gap by seamlessly integrating with underlying big data frameworks and by providing a unified framework for implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

To this end, we propose a multi-classifier approach with two-stage sampling for active learning. This intuitive and neat sampling method chooses the most promising cells across rows and columns for labeling.

Distinguished from the existing literatures of Polar codes that only consider the error detection capability of CRC, we attempt to take advantage of the inherent error correction capability of CRC and we first devise a segmented CRC-error-correcting aided SCL decoding (SCC-SCL) framework. Based on this framework, an error-correcting table based SCC-SCL (ET-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme is proposed, by introducing the look-up-table based CRC error correction method into the segmented Polar SCL decoding process. Since the error correction capability is limited by the size of the look-up table, which in turn limits the performance gain, we further propose a deep learning based SCC-SCL (DL-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme. In this scheme, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network replaces the error correction table to perform error correction, combining the sequence of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) with the syndromes to determine the error patterns. Simulation results show that both of the proposed decoding schemes have significant performance gain over the classic CRC error-detection aided SCL decoding scheme. Especially for the DL-SCC-SCL, the performance gain at bit error rate of 10-5 is about 0.5 dB.  2015 IEEE.",2020,2022-06-10 02:10:46,2022-07-31 13:49:29,,817-828,,2,6,,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCCN.2019.2946358,Long short-term memory; Deep learning; Bit error rate; Error detection; Error correction; Decoding; Table lookup; error correction; Redundancy; Turbo codes; deep learning; Error correction codes; CRC; Cyclic redundancy check codes; Performance gain; Polar codes; successive cancellation list decoding; CODES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4

This paper proposes a novel data repairing approach based on a combination of constraints and ensemble learning. At first, functional dependencies (FDs) are used as constraints to identify inconsistent records. For each FD, all repeated values in the correct records are discovered. After that, noisy attributes in erroneous records are detected using correct records and the repeated values. To correct the detected noises, a supervised ensemble learning model is constructed for each attribute. The ensemble model consists of a Bayes classifier, a decision tree, and a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). A majority of votes is used as the combination strategy in the ensemble learning model. The proposed approach automatically repairs data without any user interaction. Moreover, the proposed method can detect more than one noise in a record. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms similar repairing algorithms (HoloClean and KATARA) in both terms of precision and recall.  2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,2022-06-10 02:10:46,2022-07-30 22:48:26,,,,,159,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113511,Learning systems; Decision trees; Data mining; Multilayer neural networks; Ensemble learning; Data repairing; Functional dependency; Noise detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

However, recent research shows that current machine learning algorithms for power systems can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are small designed perturbations crafted on normal inputs that can greatly affect the overall performance of the predictor. Even with only a partial compromise of the network, an attacker could intercept and adversarially modify data from some smart meters in a limited range to make the load predictor deviate from normal prediction results. In this paper, we leverage the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm and propose a novel data repair framework to defend against these kinds of adversarial attacks. This framework complements the predictor with a self-representative auto-encoder and works in an iterative manner. The auto-encoder is used to detect and reconstruct the likely adversarial part in the input data. Different reconstruction results come up given different sensitivity levels in detection. As new data flows in each iterative time step, the service provider continuously checks the error of the previous prediction step and dynamically trades off between different detection sensitivity levels to seek an overall stable data reconstruction. Case studies on power network load forecast regression demonstrate the vulnerability of current machine learning algorithms and correspondingly the effectiveness of our defense framework.  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,2022-06-10 02:10:46,2022-07-31 04:57:03,,102-109,,,12312 LNCS,,,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61725-7_14,"Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Iterative methods; Forecasting; Deep neural networks; Network security; Signal encoding; Internet service providers; Electric power plant loads; Data transfer; Electric network analysis; Smart meters; Dynamic data repair, Load forecasting, Adversarial attacks, Power systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Arthroscopy and Laparoscopy surgeries are considered Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS). In MIS, the surgeon operates through small incisions with specialized narrow instruments, fiberoptic lights, and a monitor. Arthroscopy surgery is used to diagnose and treat joints problems, and Laparoscopic procedures are performed on the abdominal cavity. Due to non-natural hand-eye coordination, narrow field-of-view, and limited instrument control, MIS training is challenging to master. We are analyzing two simulators' data, Virtual Arthroscopic Tear Diagnosis and Evaluation Platform (VATDEP) and Gentleness Simulator. Both simulators went through the validation studies with human subjects. We recorded simulation data during the validation studies, such as tool motion, position, and task time. Recorded data went through the data preprocessing; after the data cleaning, we extracted the recoded data features and normalized them. Normalized features were used to input various machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic regression (LR). The average accuracy was evaluated through k-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods validated using 10 subjects (5 experts, 5 novices) for the VATDEP simulator. 23 subjects (4 experts and 19 novices) for the Gentleness Simulator. The result shows a significant difference between the expert and novice population with the p  0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

The traditional compression algorithm faces severe challenges. Methods: In this case, this paper proposes the deep-learning method for data compression. First, a more accurate and complete grid cloud resource status data is gathered through data cleaning, correction, and standardization, the preprocessed data is then compressed by SaDE-MSAE. Results: Experiments show that the SaDE-MSAE method can compress data faster. The data compression ratio based on neural network is basically between 45% and 60%, which is relatively stable and stronger than the traditional compression algorithm.

Four different methodologies to impute missing data in the raw data set are compared and implemented. The question of sensitivity of gap size and available data percentage on the imputation accuracy was tested. The cleaned data were then used for building energy forecasting. While the existing studies explored only the use of small recurrent networks of 2 layers and less, the question of whether a deep network of more than 2 layers would be performing better for building energy consumption forecasting should be explored.

The continuous adaptation of the Mirai malware enables the modern variant to dynamically update its malware scripts on the fly to launch even more advanced and malevolent DDoS attacks, which dramatically escalates the level of difficulty with mitigating DDoS attacks. Many researchers endeavour to develop mitigation systems to keep up with the increasing security threats. Nonetheless, most presented models provide inefficient solutions either by utilising auxiliary servers at the host site, on the cloud or at dedicated data scrubbing centres.

The applications like search engines, information retrieval, emails, etc., require user typing. In such applications, good spell-checker is essential to rectify the misspelling. Spell-checkers for western languages like English are very powerful and can handle any type of spelling errors, whereas in the case of Indian languages like Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kannada, Assamese, etc., the available spell-checkers are very basic ones. These spell-checkers are developed using traditional methods like statistical methods and rule-based methods. This article presents a novel model HINDIA to handle the spelling errors of the Hindi language, one of the most spoken languages in India. It utilizes a deep-learning method for spelling error detection and correction. The proposed spell-checking model works in two phases. In the first phase model identifies the erroneous words in the input sample and in the second phase it replaces the wrong words with the most probable correct words. Model HINDIA is developed using the attention-based encoderdecoder bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) which uses long short-term memory cells. Several modifications in the BiRNN have been made and network is fine-tuned to process the spelling errors of Hindi language. It uses publicly available dataset monolingual corpus developed by IIT Mumbai for training and testing. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in two scenarios. In the first scenario where the testing dataset is generated using split function. HINDIA performs significantly well with precision 0.86, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.78 and accuracy 0.80. Further, in the second scenario, where a dataset is manually generated its performance is fairly good with precision 0.81, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.76 and accuracy 0.74. Model HINDIA gives better performance than the deep-learning-based Malayalam spell-checker and some other deep-learning-based correction models present in the literature.  2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2021,2022-06-10 02:10:49,2022-07-31 13:32:07,,3825-3840,,8,33,,Neural Computing and Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05207-9,"Long short-term memory; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Errors; Statistical tests; Search engines; Spell-checker, Encoder–decoder recurrent neural network, Long short-term memory, Spelling, Deep-learning; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; Deep-learning; Encoder-decoder recurrent neural network; SENSORS; Spell-checker; Spelling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4

The novel algorithm is a combination of the factorization machine (FM) and the deep neural network (DNN), which adopts the one-vs-all strategy to fuse results from multiple base classifiers. 39,352 buildings affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake are taken as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-FMDNN. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model outperforms over many other popular machine learning methods due to the powerful feature learning ability, ultimately reaching an overall accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score in the value of 0.703, 0.737, and 0.702, respectively. Features associated with building structural characteristics are found to contribute more to classifying damage grades precisely. Besides, data preprocessing for data cleaning, encoding, and transformation is a necessary step to bring additional performance enhancement. For significance in the knowledge aspect, a novel multi-FMDNN algorithm is developed, which is superior in extracting both low- and high-order feature representation automatically from large volumes of destroyed buildings-related data and learning the optimal feature interactions simultaneously to pursue more accurate classification. For significance in the application aspect, the predicted results provide deep insights into a better understanding of the building vulnerability in seismic areas and inform data-driven decisions in disaster relief efforts. A promising future scope is to make full use of the available pre-event data along with some post-event data, which is possible to return fairly promising predictions and reduce the burden in earthquake field investigations for rapid responses. In future work, advanced techniques associated with data augment, hyperparameter optimization, and others will be implemented to constantly improve the overall accuracy and generalizability of the prediction model.  2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,2022-06-10 02:10:49,2022-07-31 05:53:50,,,,,77,,Sustainable Cities and Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103574,Factorization; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Network security; Network architecture; Metadata; Buildings; Disasters; Disaster prevention; Earthquakes; Automated evaluation; Deep neural network; Earthquake-induced building damage; Factorization machine; EARTHQUAKE RESILIENCE; EXPERT-SYSTEM; LOGIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

However, the battery is a complex electrochemical system with hardly observable and simulatable internal chemical reactions, and it is challenging to estimate the state of battery accurately. This paper proposes a novel flexible and reliable battery management method based on the battery big data platform and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology. First of all, to integrate the battery big data resources in the cloud, a Cyber-physical battery management framework is defined and served as the basic data platform for battery modeling issues. And to improve the quality of the collected battery data in the database, this work reports the first attempt to develop an adaptive data cleaning method for the cloud battery management issue. Furthermore, a deep learning algorithm-based feature extraction model, as well as a feature-oriented battery modeling method, is developed to mitigate the under-fitting problem and improve the accuracy of the cloud-based battery model. The actual operation data of electric buses is used to validate the proposed methodologies. The maximum data restoring error can be limited within 1.3% in the experiments, which indicates that the proposed data cleaning method is able to improve the cloud battery data quality effectively. Meanwhile, the maximum SoC estimation error in the proposed feature-oriented battery modeling method is within 2.47%, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.  2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-06-10 02:11:05,2022-07-31 14:44:04,,,,,33,,Journal of Energy Storage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2020.102064,Big data; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Information management; Embedded systems; Battery management systems; Electric vehicles; Cyber Physical System; Secondary batteries; System-on-chip; Battery energy storage; Cyber-physical battery management system; MODEL; ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; STATE; POWER; CHARGE ESTIMATION; DATA ANALYTICS; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; INTEGRATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

We use artificial missing sampling as the test set to estimate a set of imputers' performances and use the estimated performances to select the best imputer. To ensure the correctness of selection, we analyze the impact of various factors on estimation accuracy. Those factors are missing rate, size of artificial missing data and patterns, selected imputers, and noise level. We propose a two-step verifiable imputation process to integrate all of the steps. With this process, we can always leverage the most suitable imputer to achieve a high quality of imputation without tedious and error-prone data cleaning efforts.

However, dredging construction productivity is affected by many factors such as soil, hydrology, meteorology and underwater sundries, making it difficult to obtain accurate prediction results. This paper presents a new integrated approach for using intelligent data mining algorithms to analyze dredger monitoring data and estimate the effective productivity. Through these combination algorithms, alongside Lasso and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), the key features affecting the productivity are filtered out from a 255-dimensional monitoring data set. The continuous mean data cleaning method is proposed according to the characteristics of the filtered data, followed by a clean-up of the feature data to increase smoothness. Four machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, K-Nearest, Naive Bayes and eXtreme Gradient Enhancement (XGBoost), are used to estimate and analyze the productivity of a cutter suction dredger and applied to actual engineering cases. The results show that the prediction accuracy of XGBoost exceeds 90%, which is better than other algorithms used. Finally, the model is compared with the predictive model trained by the characteristics that influence productivity derived from the traditional method. The results still show that the XGBoost model with features obtained from machine learning as input terms has a better prediction effect.

However, there are also various challenges which are specific to health and care settings. The present paper describes a) healthcare specific requirements for DS4H and b) how they were addressed in our Predictive Analytics Toolset for Health and care (PATH). PATH supports the following process: objective definition, data cleaning and pre-processing, feature engineering, evaluation, result visualization, interpretation and validation and deployment. The current state of the toolset already allows the user to switch between the various involved levels, i. e. raw data (ECG), pre-processed data (averaged heartbeat), extracted features (QT time), built models (to classify the ECG into a certain rhythm abnormality class) and outcome evaluation (e. g. a false positive case) and to assess the relevance of a given feature in the currently evaluated model as a whole and for the individual decision.

It is shown that only 5% of switched labels lead to a decrease of performances. Therefore, the true class of an instance must be distinguished from its observed label. In the past decade, classification in presence of label noise was the topic of interest. Several scholars focused on kNN-based approaches for data cleansing. These types of approaches often are susceptible to high label noise rate and when a batch of instances with noisy labels are exist they may deteriorate the results. The problem arises since the methods have a local view of instances. Another approach is to have a global view of instances. In a global view, instances with large distance from their respective classes are detected as noisy. A potential problem however is the determination of a threshold. An inappropriate threshold may lead to detection of a correct instance as noisy instance. In this paper a new method for label denoising based on Bayesian aggregation is proposed which solves the problems of kNN-based approaches by aggregating the local and global views of instances. The aggregation of local and global information leads to a more robust and accurate detection of instances with noisy labels and estimation of their true labels. The experimental results show the capabilities and robustness of the proposed method.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2017,2022-06-10 02:11:07,2022-07-31 05:44:33,,903-914,,3,8,,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Verlag,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13042-015-0474-y,Supervised learning; Chemical detection; Data cleansing; Label noise; Bayesain aggregation; Mislabeled data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Identifying entities across heterogeneous data sources is paramount to many research fields, such as data cleaning, data integration, information retrieval and machine learning. The aligning process is not only overwhelmingly expensive for large data sources since it involves all tuples from two or more data sources, but also need to handle heterogeneous entity attributes. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach, called EnAli, to match entities across two or more heterogeneous data sources. EnAli employs a generative probabilistic model to incorporate the heterogeneous entity attributes via employing exponential family, handle missing values, and also utilize the locality sensitive hashing schema to reduce the candidate tuples and speed up the aligning process. EnAli is highly accurate and efficient even without any ground-truth tuples. We illustrate the performance of EnAli on re-identifying entities from the same data source, as well as aligning entities across three real data sources.

This paper presents an end-to-end solution based on the Google Cloud Platform with scalable processing capability to deal with large volumes of traffic camera data across the UK in a cost-efficient manner. It describes a deep learning pipeline to detect pedestrians and vehicles and to generate mobility statistics from these. It includes novel methods for data cleaning and post-processing using a Structure SImilarity Measure (SSIM)-based static mask that improves reliability and accuracy in classifying people and vehicles from traffic camera images. The solution resulted in statistics describing trends in the busyness of various towns and cities in the UK. We validated time series against Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras across North East England, showing a close correlation between our statistical output and the ANPR source. Trends were also favorably compared against traffic flow statistics from the UKs Department of Transport.

First, this paper proposes the data cleaning and modeling methods for expressing Nanjing's DTTN as a complex network. Second, the three consecutive weeks' data are cleaned to establish 21 DTTNs based on the proposed big data processing technology. Then, multiple topology measures that characterize the complexities' day-to-day dynamic evolution of these networks are provided. Third, these measures of 21 DTTNs are calculated and subsequently explained with actual implications. They are used as a training set for modeling the BP neural network which is designed for predicting DTTN complexities evolution. Finally, the reliability of the designed BP neural network is verified by comparing with the actual data and the results obtained from ARIMA method simultaneously. Because network complexities are the basis for modeling cascading failures and conducting link prediction in complex system, this proposed research framework not only provides a novel perspective for analyzing DTTN from the level of system aggregated behavior, but can also be used to improve the DTTN management level.",2018-03-30,2022-06-10 02:11:08,2022-07-31 02:43:47,,1850062 (22 pp.),,9,32,,Modern Physics Letters B,,Mod.

To optimize cost function, most supervised learning algorithms presume that the classes being considered are a similar cardinality and that supposition does not matter to imbalanced datasets in the case of sub-optimal classification results. Consequently, various methods have been proposed that correct imbalanced datasets such as under-sampling, over-sampling, ensemble-based methodologies, and cost-sensitive learning. However, the lack of information triggers the under-sampling and over-sampling to endure higher runtime and potential overfitting. Also, there is a disadvantage for a cost-sensitive method to handle insufficiently specified costs. To solve this issue, a new hybrid HUSCSLBoost framework has been proposed to manipulate imbalanced data through three key steps: data cleaning, data balancing, and cost accumulation. HUSCSLBoost uses Tomek-Link algorithms for eliminating noise data in the first stage and then creates several balanced subsets applying the random under-sampling. Finally, the CSLBoost method involves each balance subsets like any boost iteration, such as RUSBoost. The inclusion of a cost concept into the value update calculation for each case is based on its hardness to minimize the lack of information introduced by undertaking tests. HUSCSBoost was applied to 27 imbalanced datasets, and the outcome is considerably better than the current best-performing RUSBoost method.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2022,2022-06-10 02:11:08,2022-07-31 15:36:52,,423-435,,,869,,,,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"Virtual, Online",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0019-8_32,Classification (of information); Cost functions; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

This paper proposes two novel methods for missing data imputation, named kEMI and kEMI+, that are based on the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for pre-imputation and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for posterior-imputation. The former is a local search mechanism that aims to automatically find the best value for k and the latter makes use of the best k nearest neighbours to estimate missing scores by learning global similarities. kEMI+ makes use of a novel information fusion mechanism. It fuses top estimations through the Dempster-Shafer fusion module to obtain the final estimation. They handle both numerical and categorical features. The performance of the proposed imputation techniques are evaluated by applying them on twenty one publicly available datasets with different missingness and ratios, and, then, compared with other state-of-the-art missing data imputation techniques in terms of standard evaluation measures such as the normalized root mean square difference and the absolute error. The attained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed novel missing data imputation techniques.

This method introduces an autoregressive exogenous model and fuzzy neural network to explore the underlying distribution characteristics of wind power systems by correlation analysis of the linear and nonlinear information contained in time-series data of the wind power system. In addition, in order to eliminate outliers in the original data set, an abnormal data cleaning approach combining quartile and two-stage clustering algorithm is employed to reduce the computation time and improve the model accuracy. Moreover, the convergence of the Wiener model is proved by the Lyapunov function.

Training and validation dataset collection are required for a disease in each digestive organ under a similar image capture condition; this is the first step in system development. This data cleansing task in data collection causes a great burden among experienced endoscopists. Thus, this study classified upper gastrointestinal (GI) organ images obtained via routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) into precise anatomical categories using AlexNet. Method: In total, 85,246 raw upper GI endoscopic images from 441 patients with gastric cancer were collected retrospectively. The images were manually classified into 14 categories: 0) white-light (WL) stomach with indigo carmine (IC); 1) WL esophagus with iodine; 2) narrow-band (NB) esophagus; 3) NB stomach with IC; 4) NB stomach; 5) WL duodenum; 6) WL esophagus; 7) WL stomach; 8) NB oralpharynxlarynx; 9) WL oralpharynxlarynx; 10) WL scaling paper; 11) specimens; 12) WL muscle fibers during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); and 13) others. AlexNet is a deep learning framework and was trained using 49,174 datasets and validated using 36,072 independent datasets. Results: The accuracy rates of the training and validation dataset were 0.993 and 0.965, respectively. Conclusions: A simple anatomical organ classifier using AlexNet was developed and found to be effective in data cleansing task for collection of EGD images. Moreover, it could be useful to both expert and non-expert endoscopists as well as engineers in retrospectively assessing upper GI images.  2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,2022-06-10 02:11:10,2022-07-31 02:31:22,,,,,124,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103950,Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Diseases; Integrated circuits; Image classification; Digestive system; Endoscopy; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Anatomical classification; Upper gastrointestinal tract; CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY; GASTRIC-CANCER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

If there is no good translation mechanism for such a widely used language, it will bring trouble to both study and life. At present, the world's major platforms are committed to the study of English translation strategies. There are translation platforms from different regions and different translation mechanisms. These translation data from different translation platforms have the characteristics of large-scale, multisource, heterogeneity, high dimensions, and poor quality. However, such inconsistent translation data will increase the translation difficulty and translation time. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of translation data to achieve a better translation effect. How to provide a large-scale and efficient translation strategy needs to integrate the translation strategies of various platforms to perform heterogeneous translation data cleaning and fusion based on machine learning. At first, this paper represents the multisource, heterogeneous translation data model as tree-augmented naive Bayes networks (TANs) and naturally captures the relationship between the datasets through the learning of TANs structure and the probability distribution of input attributes and tuples, using data probability value to complete the classification of translation data cleaning. Then, a multisource, heterogeneous translation data fusion model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed, and RNN is used to control the node data of hidden layer to enhance the fault-tolerant ability in the fusion process and complete the construction of fusion model. Finally, experimental results show that TANs-based translation data cleaning method can effectively improve the cleaning rate with an average improvement of approximately 10% and cleaning time with an average reduce about 5%. In addition, RNN-based multisource translation data fusion method improves the shortcomings of the traditional fusion model and improves the practicability of the fusion model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), fusion time, and integrity.  2022 Hindawi Limited.

Machine learning offers unique advantages to learn from past cyber attacks to handle future cyber threats. The purpose of this research is to propose a framework for multi-classification of malware into well-known categories by applying different machine learning models over corpus of malware analysis reports. These reports are generated through an open source malware sandbox in an automated manner.

Motivated by this, this paper conducts an experimental comparison for the effects of missing, inconsistent, and conflicting data on classification and clustering models. From the experimental results, we observe that dirty-data impacts are related to the error type, the error rate, and the data size.

Numerous data in these disciplines are sequence of observations measured as functions of time, which can be further used for different applications via analytical or data analytics techniques (e.g., to forecast future price, climate change, etc.). However, presence of outliers can cause significant uncertainties to interpretation results; hence, it is essential to remove the outliers accurately and efficiently before conducting any further analysis. A total of 17 techniques that belong to statistical, regression-based, and machine learning (ML) based categories for outlier detection in timeseries are applied to the oil and gas production data analysis. 15 of these methods are utilized for production data analysis for the first time. Two state-of-the-art and high-performance techniques are then selected for data cleaning which require minimum control and time complexity. Moreover, performances of these techniques are evaluated based on several metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa to rank the techniques. Results show that eight unsupervised algorithms outperform the rest of the methods based on the synthetic case study with known outliers. For example, accuracies of the eight shortlisted methods are in the range of 0.830.99 with a precision between 0.83 and 0.98, compared to 0.650.82 and 0.070.77 for the others. In addition, ML-based techniques perform better than statistical techniques. Our experimental results on real field data further indicate that the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Fulford-Blasingame methods are superior to other outlier detection frameworks for outlier detection in production data, followed by four others including density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD). Even though the techniques are examined with oil and gas production data, but the same data cleaning workflow can be used to detect timeseries outliers in other disciplines.  2021",2022,2022-06-10 02:11:14,2022-07-31 04:53:30,,,,,191,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116371,Data handling; Diagnosis; Data Analytics; Statistics; Nearest neighbor search; Uncertainty analysis; Gas industry; Climate change; Outlier detection; Performance evaluation; Binary classification; Decline curve analysis; Production data analysis; ANOMALY DETECTION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Existing assessment methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone. The use of machine learning for BCA can effectively solve the above problems. However, the large amount of label noise in the dataset severely affected the performance of the BCA model. In this paper, we present an effective label ranking approach for BCA (LR-BCA). Our proposed LR-BCA method considers the natural order relationship between bridge condition ratings. Moreover, a heuristic data cleaning (HDC) approach is proposed for cleaning bridge condition dataset. The HDC method firstly identifies all the label conflict examples, then iteratively filters out the noise.

Low Birth Weight (LBW) has become an increasingly common problem, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Therefore, an ability to predict the LBW is beneficial and a good preventive measure. It is also a good indicator of future health risks of that infant. This study is concerned about the implementation of predictive LBW models for rural and urban areas of Afghanistan based on the data obtained from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015. The main objective of the study is to identify the most suitable machine learning techniques (i.e. classifiers) among the five popular ones. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Prior to implementing the predictive models, data preprocessing is carried out. This is done by means of data cleansing and feature selection. The well-known Correlation based Feature Selection algorithm (CFS) is employed to select the top ten attributes. The classifier in this study comprises two categories, Normal and LBW. The preparation of the dataset is carefully done to ensure well-balanced samples in each category. The study reveals that Random Forest is the best classifier with an accuracy of 84.70% and 85.2% and with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 91.0% and 92.1% for both rural and urban areas, respectively.

The research describes the building of a proof-of-concept for an unsupervised data curation process addressing a basic form of data cleansing in the form of identifying redundant records through entity resolution and spelling corrections. The novelty of the approach is to use ER as the first step using an unsupervised blocking and stop word scheme based on token frequency. A scoring matrix is used for linking unstandardized references, and an unsupervised process for evaluating linking results based on cluster entropy. The ER process is iterative, and in each iteration, the match threshold is increased. The prototype was tested on 18 fully-annotated test samples of primarily synthetic person data varied in two different ways, good data quality versus poor data quality, and a single record layout versus two different record layouts. In samples with good data quality and using both single and mixed layouts, the final clusters had an average F-measure of 0.91, precision of 0.96, and recall of 0.87 outcomes comparable to results from a supervised ER process. In samples with poor data quality whether mixed or single layout, the average F-measure was 0.78, precision 0.74, and recall 0.83 showing that data quality assessment and improvement is still a critical component of successful data curation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of building an unsupervised ER engine to support data integration for good quality references while avoiding the time and effort to standardize reference sources to a common layout, design, and test matching rules, design blocking keys, or test blocking alignment. Also, the paper proposes how unsupervised data quality improvement processes could also be incorporated into the design allowing the model to address an even broader range of data curation applications.  2020 Science and Information Organization.

Numerous machine learning approaches have proven effective in SDP. However, the unbalanced class distribution in SDP datasets could be a problem for some conventional learning methods. In addition, class overlap increases the difficulty for the predictors to learn the defective class accurately. In this study, we propose a new SDP model which combines class overlap reduction and ensemble imbalance learning to improve defect prediction. First, the neighbor cleaning method is applied to remove the overlapping non-defective samples. The whole dataset is then randomly under-sampled several times to generate balanced subsets so that multiple classifiers can be trained on these data. Finally, these individual classifiers are assembled with the AdaBoost mechanism to build the final prediction model. In the experiments, we investigated nine highly unbalanced datasets selected from a public software repository and confirmed that the high rate of overlap between classes existed in SDP data. We assessed the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods including conventional SDP models, imbalance learning and data cleaning methods. Test results and statistical analysis show that the proposed model provides more reasonable defect prediction results and performs best in terms of G-mean and AUC among all tested models.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2018,2022-06-10 02:11:18,2022-07-31 04:07:39,,97-125,,1,26,,Software Quality Journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-016-9342-6,"Machine learning; Classification (of information); Learning systems; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Software testing; Defects; Adaptive boosting; Computer software selection and evaluation; Software quality; Class overlap, Software defect prediction, Class imbalance, Machine learning; MACHINE; Class imbalance; QUALITY; Class overlap; Software defect prediction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Auto-WEKA is a tool to automate the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) optimization problem. In this paper, we extend the CASH problem and Auto-WEKA to support the MCPS, including preprocessing steps for both classification and regression tasks. We define the optimization problem in which the search space consists of suitably parameterized Petri nets forming the sought MCPS solutions. In the experimental analysis, we focus on examining the impact of considerably extending the search space (from approximately 22000 to 812 billion possible combinations of methods and categorical hyperparameters). In a range of extensive experiments, three different optimization strategies are used to automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available data sets. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial for different predictive models. We also present the results on seven data sets from real chemical production processes. Our findings can have a major impact on the development of high-quality predictive models as well as their maintenance and scalability aspects needed in modern applications and deployment scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The extension of Auto-WEKA to compose and optimize multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) developed as part of this paper is freely available on GitHub under GPL license, and we encourage practitioners to use it on a broad variety of classification and regression problems. The software can either be used as a blackbox-where search space is made of all possible WEKA filters, predictors, and metapredictors (e.g., ensembles)-or as an optimization tool on a subset of preselected machine learning methods. The application has a graphical user interface, but it can also run from command line and can be embedded in any project as a Java library. There are three main outputs once an Auto-WEKA run has finished: 1) the trained MCPS ready to make predictions on unseen data; 2) the WEKA configuration (i.e., parameterized components); and 3) the Petri net in a Petri Net Markup Language format that can be analyzed using any tool supporting this standard language. There are, however, some practical considerations affecting the quality of the results that must be taken into consideration, such as the CPU time budget or the search starting point. These are extensively discussed in this paper.",2019-04,2022-06-10 02:26:43,2022-07-31 15:45:26,,946-959,,2,16,,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Optimization; Petri nets; Computational modeling; Data models; Predictive models; Task analysis; Tools; Bayesian optimization; Automatic predictive model building and parameterization; combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) problem; data preprocessing; multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs); predictive modeling; SEARCH; SOFT SENSORS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Thus, it is required to classify or predict the time varying traffic characteristics of the IoT devices. However, this classification remains at large an open challenge. Most of the existing solutions are based on machine learning techniques, which nonetheless present high computational cost while non considering the fine-grained flow characteristics. To this end, in this paper we design a two-stage classification framework that utilizes both the network and statistical features to characterize the IoT devices in the context of a smart city.

In the concerned problem, we predict whether there are surplus materials under a given group of production parameters. The dataset used in this work is from a real-world three-month steel coil production process. First, data cleaning is conducted to standardize the industrial dataset. Then, the production parameters highly correlated with surplus material prediction results are selected by a series of feature selection methods.

This paper presents two approaches for the detection and imputation of anomalies in time series data. Autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are used to extract the characteristics of time series. Anomalies are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals, and the anomalous data points are imputed using the ARX and ANN models. Because the anomalies affect the model coefficients, the data cleaning process is performed iteratively. The models are re-learned on “cleaner” data after an anomaly is imputed. The anomalous data are reimputed to each iteration using the updated ARX and ANN models. The ARX and ANN data cleaning models are evaluated on natural gas time series data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed approaches are able to identify and impute anomalous data points. Forecasting models learned on the unclean data and the cleaned data are tested on an uncleaned out-of-sample dataset. The forecasting model learned on the cleaned data outperforms the model learned on the unclean data with 1.67% improvement in the mean absolute percentage errors and a 32.8% improvement in the root mean squared error.

In IoT, various objects perform the tasks of sensing, communication, and computation for providing uninterrupted services (e.g., e-health, e-transportation, security access, etc.) to the end users. In this era, Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) is an another paradigm of IoT developed to enhance the capabilities of intelligence in IoT objects where these objects can take independent decisions in any environment. IoT follows the service oriented architecture (SOA), in which the application layer is the topmost layer. It enables the IoT objects to interact with the other objects located across the globe. The power of learning, thinking, and understanding by these objects, can make the information access more accurate and reliable but Web spam is one of the challenges while accessing information from the web. It has been observed from the literature review that search engines are preferred mostly by the people for accessing information. The efficient ranking by the search engines can reduce the computational cost of information exchange by IoT objects. Search engines should be able to prevent the spam from being injected into the web. But, the existing techniques for this problem target in finding the spam after its occurrence in search engine result pages. So, in this proposal, we present an intelligent cognitive spammer framework, Cognitive spammer, which eliminates the spam pages during the web page rank score calculation by search engines. The framework update the Google’s ranking algorithm, PageRank in such a way that it automatically prevents link spam by considering the link structure of web for rank score computation. The updated PageRank algorithm provided the better ranking of web pages. The proposed framework is validated with the WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset. Before processing, the dataset is preprocessed with a new technique, called as ‘Split by Over-sampling and Train by Under-fitting’ to remove the trade off between imbalanced instances of target class. After data cleaning, we applied machine learning techniques (Bagged model, Boosted linear model, etc) with the web page features to make accurate predictions. The detection classifiers only consider the link features of the web page irrespective of the page content. Out of the fifteen classifiers, best three are ensemble, which results in better performance with overall accuracy improvement. Ten-fold cross validation has also been applied with the resulted ensemble model, which results in getting the accuracy of 99.6% in the proposed scheme.",2019-01-01,2022-06-10 03:07:32,2022-07-31 02:36:25,,381-404,,,90,,Future Generation Computer Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cognitive IoT; Internet of Things(IoT); PageRank; Web spam; ALGORITHMS; WEB; FEATURES; THINGS; IMAGES; INTERNET; COMPUTATION; OIL-SPILLS; RADIO; TRUST PROPAGATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Almost none of such papers include data cleaning and data quality assessment in their study design despite this being a very critical step during data mining. This paper presents 2 novel data cleaning methods that permit identification of animals with good and bad data quality. The first method is a deterministic or rule-based data cleaning method. Reproduction and mutation or life-changing events such as birth and death were converted to a symbolic (alphabetical letter) representation and split into triplets (3-letter code). The triplets were manually labeled as physiologically correct, suspicious, or impossible. The deterministic data cleaning method was applied to assess the quality of data stored in dairy herd management from 26 farms enrolled in the herd health management program from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Ghent University, Belgium. In total, 150,443 triplets were created, 65.4% were labeled as correct, 17.4% as suspicious, and 17.2% as impossible. The second method, a probabilistic method, uses a machine learning algorithm (random forests) to predict the correctness of fertility and mutation events in an early stage of data cleaning. The prediction accuracy of the random forests algorithm was compared with a classical linear statistical method (penalized logistic regression), outperforming the latter substantially, with a superior receiver operating characteristic curve and a higher accuracy (89 vs. 72%). From those results, we conclude that the triplet method can be used to assess the quality of reproduction data stored in dairy herd management software and that a machine learning technique such as random forests is capable of predicting the correctness of fertility data.",2017-05-01,2022-06-10 03:07:32,2022-07-31 05:07:46,,4078-4089,,5,100,,Journal of Dairy Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,random forests; data quality; dairy herd management software; dairy reproduction; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; FRAMEWORK; PERFORMANCE; WORKLOAD; TIME; DISEASE; RECORDING-SYSTEM; SECONDARY DATA SOURCES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Politically and socially, increased demands regarding sustainability and resource consumption are streaming into the focus of companies. One solution strategy to increase the productivity of existing production systems while ensuring existing quality standards is the application of data-driven analytical methods such as machine learning. Due to the frequent changes in production conditions, the analysis of real manufacturing data is linked to sophisticated data pre-processing. Changes in production data are manifested in trends and systematic shifts over time. Data pre-processing includes rule-based data cleaning, the application of dimension reduction techniques and the identification of comparable data subsets. Within the used dataset of hydraulic valves by Bosch, the comparability of the same production conditions in the manufacturing of hydraulic valves can be identified within certain periods. Machine learning methods can process large amounts of data, unfavorable row-column ratios and discover dependencies between the input data and the specified target variable as well as evaluate the multidimensional influence of all input variables on the target variable. For use cases in manufacturing, neural networks, support vector machines and tree-based methods have so far proved to be very successful. The use of cross-process production data along the value chain of hydraulic valves is a promising approach to predict the quality characteristics of workpieces. Within this research, machine learning methods with deep and shallow structures are applied to predict the internal leakage of hydraulic valves based on geometric gauge blocks from machining, mating data from assembly and hydraulic measurement data from end-of-line testing. Moreover, the most suitable methods are selected, and accurate quality predictions are obtained.",2022-01-01,2022-06-10 03:07:32,2022-07-31 05:20:01,,320-325,,,107,,Procedia CIRP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2022.04.052,Machine Learning; Supervised Learning; Hydraulic Testing; Predictive Quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

One prominent example in reinforcement learning is model-based planning, which specifically relates to transdiagnostic compulsivity. However, the reliability of computational model-derived measures such as model-based planning is unclear. Establishing reliability is necessary to ensure that such models measure stable, traitlike processes, as assumed in computational psychiatry. Although analysis approaches affect validity of reinforcement learning models and reliability of other task-based measures, their effect on reliability of reinforcement learning models of empirical data has not been systematically studied. Methods We first assessed within- and across-session reliability and effects of analysis approaches (model estimation, parameterization, and data cleaning) of measures of model-based planning in patients with compulsive disorders (n = 38). The analysis approaches affecting test-retest reliability were tested in 3 large generalization samples (healthy participants: n = 541 and 111; people with a range of compulsivity: n = 1413). Results Analysis approaches greatly influenced reliability: reliability of model-based planning measures ranged from 0 (no concordance) to above 0.9 (acceptable for clinical applications). The largest influence on reliability was whether model-estimation approaches were robust and accounted for the hierarchical structure of estimated parameters. Improvements in reliability generalized to other datasets and greatly reduced the sample size needed to find a relationship between model-based planning and compulsivity in an independent dataset. Conclusions These results indicate that computational psychiatry measures such as model-based planning can reliably measure latent decision-making processes, but when doing so must assess the ability of methods to estimate complex models from limited data.",2020-06-01,2022-06-10 03:07:32,2022-07-31 05:56:49,,601-609,,6,5,,Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reinforcement learning; Reliability; Computational modeling; Compulsivity; Computational psychiatry; Psychometrics; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; ERROR; TRACKING; DECISION-MAKING; PROTECTS; REWARD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Thus, reliable demand predictions can be imperative in planning voluntary blood donation campaigns and improving blood availability within Ghana hospitals. However, most historical datasets on blood demand in Ghana are predominantly contaminated with missing values and outliers due to improper database management systems. Consequently, time-series prediction can be challenging since data cleaning can affect models’ predictive power. Also, machine learning (ML) models’ predictive power for backcasting past years’ lost data is understudied compared to their forecasting abilities. This study thus aims to compare K-Nearest Neighbour regression (KNN), Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Neural Network Auto-regressive (NNAR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models via a rolling-origin strategy, for forecasting and backcasting a blood demand data with missing values and outliers from a government hospital in Ghana. KNN performed well in forecasting blood demand (12.55% error); whereas, ELM achieved the highest backcasting power (19.36% error).

Many studies on the potential roles of environmental factors in the transmission of the novel COVID-19 have been published. However, the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 remains controversial. Machine learning techniques have been used effectively in combating the COVID-19 epidemic. However, researches related to machine learning on weather conditions in spreading COVID-19 is generally lacking. Therefore, in this study, three machine learning models (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), ADtree Classifier and BayesNet) based on the confirmed cases and weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are developed. This study aims to identify the best classification model to classify COVID-19 by using significant weather features chosen by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection method. The DS4C COVID-19 data set is used to train and validate each machine learning model. Several data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature selection have been conducted on the raw dataset to ensure the quality of the training data. The performance of these machine learning algorithms is further rectified based on the selected features set by PCA. Each classifier is then optimized using different tuning parameters to achieve optimum values before comparing the output of the three classifiers against each other. The observational results have shown that the optimized CNN classifier with seven weather variables selected by PCA achieved the highest performance among all the techniques.

In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record-including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers-to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms-Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB)-and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90 +/- 0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93 +/- 0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77 +/- 0.04 and average ROCAUC 0.81 +/- 0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings. Importantly, the best performing model had a false positive rate of 8%, as compared to rates of 20% or higher in previously reported studies. This artificial intelligence approach can help screen patients for whom an abuse concern exists and streamline the identification of patients who may benefit from referral to a child protection team. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to develop computer-aided-diagnosis platforms for the challenging and often intractable problem of reliably identifying pediatric patients suffering from physical abuse.",2021-02-26,2022-06-13 21:23:28,2022-07-30 22:42:06,,,,2,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000624538400041,,,,,,,PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; RULE; VALIDATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Hence a great importance is emphasized on data cleaning and pre-processing step in this paper. The classification and detection of fake jobs can be done with high accuracy and high precision. Hence the machine learning and deep learning algorithms have to be applied on cleaned and pre-processed data in order to achieve a better accuracy. Further, deep learning neural networks are used so as to achieve higher accuracy. Finally all these classification models are compared with each other to find the classification algorithm with highest accuracy and precision.",2021-04,2022-06-13 21:23:29,2022-07-31 13:46:01,,642-650,,2,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000658894000051,,,,,,,Data Cleaning; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM); Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Ensemble Modeling; Logistic Regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Radar is an important data source used by operational meteorologists for issuing nowcasting warnings. With the main goal of helping meteorologists in analysing radar data for issuing nowcasting warnings, we propose NowDeepN, a supervised learning based regression model which uses an ensemble of deep artificial neural networks for predicting the values for radar products at a certain time moment. The values predicted by NowDeepN may be used by meteorologists in estimating the future development of potential severe phenomena and would replace the time consuming process of extrapolating the radar echoes. NowDeepN is intended to be a proof of concept for the effectiveness of learning from radar data relevant patterns that would be useful for predicting future values for radar products based on their historical values. For assessing the performance of NowDeepN, a set of experiments on real radar data provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration is conducted. The impact of a data cleaning step introduced for correcting the erroneous radar products' values is investigated both from the computational and meteorological perspectives. The experimental results also indicate the relevance of the features considered in the supervised learning task, highlighting that the radar products' values at a certain geographical location at a time moment may be predicted from the products' values from a neighboring area of that location at previous time moments. An overall Normalized Root Mean Squared Error less than 4% was obtained for NowDeepN on the cleaned radar data. Compared to similar related work from the nowcasting literature, NowDeepN outperforms several approaches and this emphasizes the performance of our proposal.",2021-01,2022-06-13 21:23:30,2022-07-31 03:04:42,,,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000605816600001,,,,,,,machine learning; MACHINE; IDENTIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; deep neural networks; Principal Component Analysis; autoencoders; TRACKING; weather nowcasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Maintenance is one of the important activities in the manufacturing process, and it requires proper attention. To decrease maintenance costs and to attain sustainable operational management, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) has become important in industries. The principle of PdM is forecasting the next failure; thus, the respective maintenance is scheduled before the predicted failure occurs. In the construction of maintenance management, facility managers generally employ reactive or preventive maintenance mechanisms. However, reactive maintenance does not have the ability to prevent failure and preventive maintenance does not have the ability to predict the future condition of mechanical, electrical, or plumbing components. Therefore, to improve the facilities' lifespans, such components are repaired in advance. In this paper, a PdM planning model is developed using intelligent methods. The developed method involves five main phases: (a) data cleaning, (b) data normalization, (c) optimal feature selection, (d) prediction network decision-making, and (e) prediction. Initially, the data pertaining to PdM are subjected to data cleaning and normalization in order to arrange the data within a particular limit. Optimal feature selection is performed next, to reduce redundant information. Optimal feature selection is performed using a hybrid of the Jaya algorithm and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). As the prediction values differ in range, it is difficult for machine learning or deep learning face to provide accurate results. Thus, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to make decisions regarding the prediction network. The SVM identifies the network in which prediction can be performed for the concerned range. Finally, the prediction is accomplished using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In the RNN, the weight is optimized using the hybrid J-SLnO. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can efficiently predict the future condition of components for maintenance planning by using two datasets-aircraft engine and lithium-ion battery datasets.",2022-03,2022-06-13 21:23:30,2022-07-31 04:45:21,,,,6,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000774448000001,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14063387,learning (artificial intelligence); decision making; production engineering computing; recurrent neural nets; optimisation; support vector machines; maintenance engineering; machine learning; recurrent neural network; support vector machine; preventive maintenance; sustainable development; OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK; 0; industry 4; Jaya-based sea lion optimization; predictive maintenance planning; sustainable manufacturing; SYSTEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Different computational methods exploiting the features of proteins have been developed to identify the binding sites in the protein structure, but none seems to provide promising results, and therefore, further investigation is required. Results In this study, we present a deep learning model PUResNet and a novel data cleaning process based on structural similarity for predicting protein-ligand binding sites.

However, little attention has been paid to discuss how the input data quality impacts the result. Indeed, some review-rating pairs that a user gave to an item are inconsistent and express a different opinion, making the recommendation result biased. To solve the above drawback, this study proposes a two-phase deep learning-based recommender system. Firstly, a sentiment predictor of textual reviews is created, serving as the quality inspector that cleans and improves the input for a recommender. To build accurate predictors, this phase tries and compares a set of deep learning-based algorithms. Secondly, besides only exploiting the consistent review-rating pairs generated by the quality inspector, this phase builds deep learning-based recommender engines. The experiments on a real-world dataset showed the proposed data quality inspector, based on textual reviews, improves the overall performance of recommenders. On average, applying deep learning-based quality inspectors result in an above 6% improvement in RMSE, and more than a 2% boost in F1 score, and accuracy. This is robust evidence to prove the importance of the input data cleaning process in this field. Moreover, empirical evidence indicates the deep learning approach is suitable for modeling the sentiment predictor, and the core recommendation process, clearly outperforming the traditional machine learning methods.</p>",2021-10,2022-06-13 21:23:32,2022-07-31 01:45:04,,,,20,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000716032900001,,,,,,,deep learning; data quality; text classification; collaborative filtering; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; recommendation system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Modifications made during manual data cleaning may affect nutrient intakes. Objectives: We evaluated the effects of modifications made during manual data cleaning on nutrient intakes of interest: energy, carbohydrate, total fat, protein, and fiber. Methods: Differences in mean intake before and after data cleaning modifications for all recalls and average intakes per subject were analyzed by paired t-tests. The Chi-squared test was used to determine whether unsupervised recalls had more open-ended text responses that required modification than supervised recalls. We characterized food types of text response modifications. Correlations between predictive energy requirements, measured total energy expenditure (TEE), and mean energy intake from raw and modified data were examined. Results: After excluding 11 recalls with invalidating technical errors, 1499 valid recalls completed by 393 subjects were included in this analysis. We found significant differences before and after modifications for energy, carbohydrate, total fat, and protein intakes for all recalls (P < 0.05). Limiting to modified recalls, there were significant differences for all nutrients of interest, including fiber (P < 0.02). There was not a significantly greater proportion of text responses requiring modification for home compared with supervised recalls (P = 0.271). Predicted energy requirements correlated highly with TEE. There was no significant difference in correlation of mean energy intake with TEE for modified compared with raw data. Mean intake for individual subjects was significantly different for energy, protein, and fat intakes following cleaning modifications (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Manual modifications can change mean nutrient intakes for an entire cohort and individuals. However, modifications did not significantly affect the correlation of energy intake with predictive requirements and measured expenditure.

Material and methods: A cohort of 153 head-and-neck cancer patients was used to model xerostomia at 0-6 months (early), 6-15 months (late), 15-24 months (long-term), and at any time (a longitudinal model) after radiotherapy. Predictive power of the features was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of univariate logistic regression models. The multivariate NTCP models were tuned and tested with single and nested cross-validation, respectively. We compared predictive performance of seven classification algorithms, six feature selection methods, and ten data cleaning/class balancing techniques using the Friedman test and the Nemenyi post hoc analysis. Results: NTCP models based on the parotid mean dose failed to predict xerostomia (AUCs < 0.60). The most informative predictors were found for late and long-term xerostomia. Late xerostomia correlated with the contralateral dose gradient in the anterior posterior (AUC = 0.72) and the right left (AUC = 0.68) direction, whereas long-term xerostomia was associated with parotid volumes (AUCs > 0.85), dose gradients in the right left (AUCs > 0.78), and the anterior posterior (AUCs > 0.72) direction. Multivariate models of long-term xerostomia were typically based on the parotid volume, the parotid eccentricity, and the dose volume histogram (DVH) spread with the generalization AUCs ranging from 0.74 to 0.88. On average, support vector machines and extra-trees were the top performing classifiers, whereas the algorithms based on logistic regression were the best choice for feature selection. We found no advantage in using data cleaning or class balancing methods. Conclusion: We demonstrated that incorporation of organ- and dose-shape descriptors is beneficial for xerostomia prediction in highly conformal radiotherapy treatments.

However, natural population-based screening projects require a large number of resources. With the emergence and development of machine learning, researchers have started to pursue more flexible and efficient methods to screen or predict type 2 diabetes. Objective: The aim of this study was to build prediction models based on the ensemble learning method for diabetes screening to further improve the health status of the population in a noninvasive and inexpensive manner. Methods: The dataset for building and evaluating the diabetes prediction model was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011-2016. After data cleaning and feature selection, the dataset was split into a training set (80%, 2011-2014), test set (20%, 2011-2014) and validation set (2015-2016). Three simple machine learning methods (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest) and easy ensemble methods were used to build diabetes prediction models. The performance of the models was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. The Delong test (2-sided) was used to test the performance differences between the models. Results: We selected 8057 observations and 12 attributes from the database. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the three simple methods yielded highly predictive performance models with areas under the curve (AUCs) over 0.800, wherein the ensemble methods significantly outperformed the simple methods. When we evaluated the models in the test set and validation set, the same trends were observed. The ensemble model of linear discriminant analysis yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.849, an accuracy of 0.730, a sensitivity of 0.819, and a specificity of 0.709 in the validation set. Conclusions: This study indicates that efficient screening using machine learning methods with noninvasive tests can be applied to a large population and achieve the objective of secondary prevention.",2020-06,2022-06-13 21:23:38,2022-07-31 13:58:23,,,,6,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000546388900003,,,,,,,machine learning; RISK; HEALTH; ADULTS; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; non-invasive attributes; POPULATION; screening; type 2 diabetes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Widespread application of PMU produces a vast amount of time-synchronized historical operating data, making it possible to turn to machine learning approaches to detect the attacks. However, anomalous events occur rarely in practice. To construct a balanced training dataset, where normal and anomalous instances need to be evenly extracted and labeled from historical operating records, is sure to cost plenty of human efforts and may introduce uncontrollable experience errors. In this paper, we design a novel detection model with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) based data augmentation and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)based data cleaning technique to reconstruct the imbalanced training dataset into a balanced one to train the subsequent XGBoost classifier. Experiments show that although rare anomalous historical event records are needed, our model is still able to effectively detect out DMAs in power systems.",2017,2022-06-13 21:23:38,2022-07-31 05:41:50,,373-378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000427701300069,,,,,,,XGBoost; cyber-physical security; data manipulation attack detection; imbalanced classification; SMOTE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON ENERGY INTERNET AND ENERGY SYSTEM INTEGRATION (EI2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

The complexity of the task stems not just from the macroevolutionary and macroecological challenge of modeling so many species, but also from the difficulty in collecting and quantifying birdsong itself. Using machine learning techniques, we extracted songs from a large citizen science dataset, and then analyzed the evolution, and biotic and abiotic predictors of variation in birdsong across 578 passerine species. Contrary to expectations, we found few links between life-history traits (monogamy and sexual dimorphism) and the evolution of song pitch (peak frequency) or song complexity (standard deviation of frequency). However, we found significant support for morphological constraints on birdsong, as reflected in a negative correlation between bird size and song pitch. We also found that broad-scale biogeographical and climate factors such as net primary productivity, temperature, and regional species richness were significantly associated with both the evolution and present-day distribution of bird song features.

Remote sensing that holds detailed and abundant information on spectral, textual, contextual, and spatial configurations is crucial to obtaining land use maps that reveal changes in the urban environment. However, social sensing is essential to revealing the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of urban land use. This data mining approach is related to data cleaning/outlier removal and machine learning, and is used to achieve land use classification from remote and social sensing data. In bicycle and taxi density maps, the daytime destination and nighttime origin density reflects work-related land uses, including commercial and industrial areas. By contrast, the nighttime destination and daytime origin density pattern captures the pattern of residential areas. The accuracy assessment of land use classified maps shows that the integration of remote and social sensing, using the decision tree and random forest methods, yields accuracies of 83% and 86%, respectively. Thus, this approach facilitates an accurate urban land use classification.

In particular, analyses of 3.6 million underwater trajectories of a fish with the water temperature at the time of acquisition are presented. Although there are many false detections and incorrect trajectory assignments, by a combination of data binning and robust estimation methods, reliable evidence for an increase in fish speed as water temperature increases are demonstrated. Then, a method for data cleaning which removes outliers arising from false detections and incorrect trajectory assignments using a deep learning-based clustering algorithm is proposed.

The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models.

FHIPT8Y8,conferencePaper,2016.0,"Ahmed, J; Soomrani, MAR; IEEE",TDTD: Thyroid Disease Type Diagnostics,,1562-5850,,,,"Recently; medical data mining has become one of the well-established research areas of machine learning and AI base techniques have been used to solve the complex classification problem of thyroid disease. Due to the existence of non-palpable nodules it is very hard to detect the structural changes of thyroid disease by assessing the thyroid functional changes. For instance at structural level ""Euthyroid"" is normal thyroid hormonal functional state but this would be involved in initial structural changes such as goiter, cold nodule, MNG (multiple nodule goiter) and cancer (Grave's Disease and so on). The ideal system should not only identify all the thyroid disease types but also recommend state of structural levels; otherwise it would be converted into serious disease, such like cancer. In-order to mitigate such problems, this paper proposes a framework TDTD (Thyroid Disease Types Diagnostics) that aims to assist the physicians during the diagnostic process of thyroid diseases in a very structured and transparent manner. Proposed system TDTD presents a novel method MDC (Medical data cleaning) for filling of missing values in medical datasets by building classifier based upon the Bayesian isotonic regression algorithm because missing values of medical data (i.e. blood tests) are different in nature and they could not be filled with normal procedures. In second phase two classifiers are trained to classify the functional and structural levels of thyroid disease at granular level using multi and binary SVM (support vector machine) algorithms, in final phase performance and evaluation is approximated using confusion matrix, precision and recall measures.",2016,2022-06-13 21:23:40,2022-07-31 15:35:50,,44-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000386368400009,,,,,,,machine learning; missing values; Datamining; goiters; thyroid hormone; SYSTEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (ICISE),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

In many low and middle-income countries, TB remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Once a patient has been diagnosed with TB, it is critical that healthcare workers make the most appropriate treatment decision given the individual conditions of the patient and the likely course of the disease based on medical experience. Depending on the prognosis, delayed or inappropriate treatment can result in unsatisfactory results including the exacerbation of clinical symptoms, poor quality of life, and increased risk of death. This work benchmarks machine learning models to aid TB prognosis using a Brazilian health database of confirmed cases and deaths related to TB in the State of Amazonas. The goal is to predict the probability of death by TB thus aiding the prognosis of TB and associated treatment decision making process. In its original form, the data set comprised 36,228 records and 130 fields but suffered from missing, incomplete, or incorrect data. Following data cleaning and preprocessing, a revised data set was generated comprising 24,015 records and 38 fields, including 22,876 reported cured TB patients and 1139 deaths by TB. To explore how the data imbalance impacts model performance, two controlled experiments were designed using (1) imbalanced and (2) balanced data sets. The best result is achieved by the Gradient Boosting (GB) model using the balanced data set to predict TB-mortality, and the ensemble model composed by the Random Forest (RF), GB and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models is the best model to predict the cure class.",2021-06,2022-06-13 21:23:40,2022-07-31 14:45:41,,,,2,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000665146300001,,,,,,,feature selection; machine learning; ensemble model; RISK; CLASSIFICATION; SCORE; VALIDATION; benchmark; DEATH; EVOLUTIONARY; imbalanced data sets; INFECTIONS; neglected tropical disease; prognosis; random search; tuberculosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
CWCY8IJI,journalArticle,2019.0,"Zhang, WN; Tan, XY; IEEE",Combining Outlier Detection and Reconstruction Error Minimization for Label Noise Reduction,,,,,,"Label noise is a common phenomenon when labeling a large-scale dataset for supervised learning. Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.",2019,2022-06-13 21:23:40,2022-07-31 15:38:01,,238-241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000469779800038,,,,,,,CLASSIFICATION; label noise; outlier detection; reconstruction error minimization; robust deep autoencoder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

Although pollutants can be filtered to a considerable extent by after-treatment devices equipment, emissions can still exceed the designated standards when after-treatment devices function improperly. To timely identify excessive emissions, we propose a general and systematic framework, including a data quality assessment and a data repairing and excessive emission determination process, based on the data sensed from the on-board diagnostics (OBD) monitoring system. To overcome the adverse effects of poor data quality, a set of approaches have been developed for the different statuses of data quality. When all variables contain missing or abnormal values, data repairing algorithms can be employed to improve data quality. Two strategies have been developed for the situation where only the NOx data is problematic. One is to improve data quality by using the other variables before identifying excessive emissions, and the other is to directly predict whether the emissions exceed recommendations by using other variables without the data quality problem. To reduce the impact of noise and extreme values, three methods based on the moving average principle have been developed to generate an aggregated emission level for the determination of excessive emissions. In the experimental study, we employed a number of machine learning algorithms to achieve data repairing and prediction. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm slightly outperforms the random forests (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) in the prediction of the excessive emission possibility in terms of prediction accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the most accurate data repairing can be achieved by probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), as compared to non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). However, the proposed approach does not restrict other algorithms from achieving the functions of data repairing and prediction.  2022 by the authors.

In this paper, the LSTM neural networks is used to correct the on-line monitoring data of transformer oil chromatogram. The off-line test data combined with neural networks data cleaning technology are used to repeatedly feed back and calibrate the online data, so that the corrected chromatographic on-line number is steadily close to the off-line detection data, which greatly improves the availability and accuracy of on-line chromatographic data.

Unfortunately, the main problem of these reviews, which is not completely tackled, is the existence of deceptive reviews. The novelty of the proposed system is the application of opinion mining on consumers' reviews to help businesses and organizations continually improve their market strategies and obtain an in-depth analysis of the consumers' opinions regarding their products and brands. In this paper, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and deep learning convolutional neural network integrated with LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models were used for sentiment analysis of reviews in the e-commerce domain. The system was tested and evaluated by using real-time data that included reviews of cameras, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, televisions, and video surveillance products from the Amazon website. Data preprocessing steps, such as lowercase processing, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and tokenization, were used for data cleaning. The clean data were processed with the LSTM and CNN-LSTM models for the detection and classification of the consumers' sentiment into positive or negative. The LSTM and CNN-LSTM algorithms achieved an accuracy of 94% and 91%, respectively.

However, if the training data are corrupted by noisy labels, the resulting performance might be deteriorated. In the domain of medical image analysis, this dilemma becomes extremely severe. This is because the medical image annotation always requires medical expertise and clinical experience, which would inevitably introduce subjectivity. In this paper, we design a novel algorithm based on the teacher-student architecture for noisy-labeled medical image segmentation. Creatively, We introduce confident learning (CL) method to identify the corrupted labels and endow CNN an anti-interference ability to the noises. Specifically, the CL technique is introduced to the teacher model to characterize the suspected wrong-labeled pixels. Since the noise identification maps are a little away from sufficient precision, the spatial label smoothing regularization technique is utilized to generate soft-corrected masks for training the student model. Since our method identifies and revises the noisy labels of the training data in a pixel-level rather than simply assigns lower weights to the noisy masks, it outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the noisy-labeled image segmentation task on the JSRT dataset, especially when the training data are severely corrupted by noises.

How to transform the huge ""data resources"" into ""data assets"" and fully utilize data and tap their real value to better serve society is a main concern in the oil and gas industry today. Therefore, the oil industry needs to complete the industrial upgrading of ""Smart Oilfield"" through digital and intelligent transformation. In recent years, the rise of big data technology and artificial intelligence have allowed international oil companies and oil service giants to accelerate the construction of digital and intelligent oil fields. The overall framework of the big data intelligent platform of oil and gas resources should be based on data resources with big data platform computing power as the support and artificial intelligence algorithms as the core. To meet the production needs of the oil and gas industry, it is of great urgency to build an oil and gas data resource pool that integrates exploration, development, and production data. The data quality can be improved via data cleaning and fusion. Physical simulations, data mining, and other approaches should be combined to achieve the modularization of service functions. Additionally, the goals of intelligent monitoring, early warning, and display on multi-dimensional platforms such as PC, control screen, and mobile apps can also be achieved. The analysis of artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning in the context of the oil and gas industry shows that these methods have good application prospects. In the future, oil companies should work together with scientific research institutes to tap the huge potential of oil industry data, achieve cost reduction and efficiency increase, and build a new smart oil and gas industrial ecosystem to complete industrial upgrading.

First, the nonlinear regression model between the wind speed and the power is established by the back propagation (BP) neural network. Then, the distances between the real data and the nonlinear regression model are approximated by employing the designed auxiliary points. The candidate abnormal data and the current normal data are separated by a threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in descending order. At the same time, based on the set of candidate abnormal data, the candidate normal data is selected through another threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in ascending order.
