A generalizable speech emotion recognition model reveals depression and remission,NO,,,,"Objective Affective disorders are associated with atypical voice patterns; however, automated voice analyses suffer from small sample sizes and untested generalizability on external data. We investigated a generalizable approach to aid clinical evaluation of depression and remission from voice using transfer learning: We train machine learning models on easily accessible non-clinical datasets and test them on novel clinical data in a different language. Methods A Mixture of Experts machine learning model was trained to infer happy/sad emotional state using three publicly available emotional speech corpora in German and US English. We examined the model's predictive ability to classify the presence of depression on Danish speaking healthy controls (N = 42), patients with first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD) (N = 40), and the subset of the same patients who entered remission (N = 25) based on recorded clinical interviews. The model was evaluated on raw, de-noised, and speaker-diarized data. Results The model showed separation between healthy controls and depressed patients at the first visit, obtaining an AUC of 0.71. Further, speech from patients in remission was indistinguishable from that of the control group. Model predictions were stable throughout the interview, suggesting that 20-30 s of speech might be enough to accurately screen a patient. Background noise (but not speaker diarization) heavily impacted predictions. Conclusion A generalizable speech emotion recognition model can effectively reveal changes in speaker depressive states before and after remission in patients with MDD. Data collection settings and data cleaning are crucial when considering automated voice analysis for clinical purposes.","Hansen, L; Zhang, YP; Wolf, D; Sechidis, K; Ladegaard, N; Fusaroli, R",10.1111/acps.13388,journalArticle,EZRW4LZS,2022,,1

Prediction Method of NO x from Power Station Boilers Based on Neural Network,NO,,,,"In the coal-fired power generation system, it is necessary to predict the NOx emissions of power station boilers when it comes to the step to spray ammonia to ensure that NOx emissions do not exceed national standards. Using traditional machine learning algorithms in the modeling of power station boilers will require features selection and steady-state extraction, which is not suitable for practical applications. In order to reduce the NOx prediction error rate under variable operating conditions, a multi-model fusion algorithm S3LX combined with linear regression, XGBoost, and long-short-Term memory recurrent neural network is proposed to model the NOx emission prediction of power station boilers. The preprocessing data scheme suitable for power station boiler data sets is proposed and implemented in this paper, which can perform numerical processing, data cleaning and data standardization for boiler's data and features. A 7-day historical operating data set of a unit in Guangzhou Shajiao C Power Plant was used as the training set and test set and was used to build the NOx emission prediction model after data preprocessing. Results show that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, S3LX has good prediction ability under varying conditions with an average error of 4.28%. Compared with the average prediction error of the multi-layer perceptron 9.16%, SVM 7.37%, S3LX makes the error significantly reduced and satisfies the actual engineering demand.  2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Zhang, Yuzuo; Li, Yuanhao; Zhang, Xinyan; Zheng, Shijue",10.1142/S0218126621500973,journalArticle,R2AJZGBS,2021,,1

A Holistic Machine Learning Approach to Identify Performance Anomalies in Enterprise WiFi Deployments,NO,,,,"In large-scale enterprise WiFi deployments, performance anomalies need to be detected autonomously without human intervention. The state of the art in detection and diagnosis of faults is a manual and slow process. Experts with domain-knowledge use alarms, traces, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) data to understand the anomalies. In large-scale deployments, this is becoming an increasingly inefficient approach. The objective of this study is to determine anomalies in a WiFi network by exploiting big data, machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques. Our work comprises of setting up WiFi access points and retrieving the KPI of client devices which are connected to access points. The metrics for client devices, access points and channel nodes are periodically logged on the cloud, and collected through an API. We develop a multivariate time series data which undergoes data preprocessing, such as data cleaning and data transformation prior to using ML algorithms. To detect anomalous instances, an unsupervised algorithm, Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used. Clusters obtained through DBSCAN are analyzed under dimensionality reduction technique t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. While DBSCAN helps to obtain the outliers, the output of the dimensionality reduction technique enable us to coherently comprehend the dynamics of clusters. Our methodology involves a thorough analysis of the outliers from the dataset through legacy supervised and self-supervised ML models, as well as ensemble learning techniques.  2022 SPIE.

Cleaning sensor data in smart heating control system,NO,,,,"Sometimes, smart heating control applications are partially equipped with missing values and outliers in the sensor data due to software/hardware failures/human errors. To provide an effective analysis and decision-making, erroneous sensor data should be cleaned by imputation of missing values and smoothing outliers. In this paper, we present a case of the Smart Heating Control System (SHCS) installed in the South Ural State University, and describe the structure and development principles of Data Cleaning Module (DCM) of the system. We implement DCM through data mining and neural network technologies as a set of the following subsystems. The preprocessor extracts raw data from the system's data warehouse and prepares a training data for further processing. Predictor provides Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the next value of a sensor based on its historical data. Reconstructor determines if the current value of a sensor is an outlier, and if so, imputes it by the synthetic value from Predictor. Finally, Anomaly Detector subsystem discovers anomalous sequences in the sensor data. In the experiments on the real sensor data, DCM showed relatively high and stable accuracy as well as adequate detection of anomalies.","Zymbler, M.; Kraeva, Y.; Latypova, E.; Kumar, S.; Shnayder, D.; Basalaev, A.",10.1109/GloSIC50886.2020.9267813,conferencePaper,2H377BRH,2020,,1

Toward Data Cleaning with a Target Accuracy: A Case Study for Value Normalization,traditional DC,,,,"Many applications need to clean data with a target accuracy. As far as we know, this problem has not been studied in depth. In this paper we take the first step toward solving it. We focus on value normalization (VN), the problem of replacing all string that refer to the same entity with a unique string. VN is ubiquitous, and we often want to do VN with 100% accuracy. This is typically done today in industry by automatically clustering the strings then asking a user to verify and clean the clusters, until reaching 100% accuracy. This solution has significant limitations. It does not tell the users how to verify and clean the clusters. This part also often takes a lot of time, e.g., days. Further, there is no effective way for multiple users to collaboratively verify and clean. In this paper we address these challenges. Overall, our work advances the state of the art in data cleaning by introducing a novel cleaning problem and describing a promising solution template. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

BlackEye: automatic IP blacklisting using machine learning from security logs,NO,,,,"Blacklisting of malicious IP address is a primary technique commonly used for safeguarding mission-critical IT systems. The decision to blacklist an IP address requires careful examination of various aspects of packet traffic data as well as the behavioral history. Most of the current security monitoring for IP blacklisting heavily relies on the domain expertise from experienced specialists. Although there are efforts to apply machine-learning (ML) techniques to this problem, we are yet to see the mature solution. To mitigate these challenges and to gain better understanding of the problem, we have designed the BlackEye framework in which we can apply various ML techniques and produce models for accurate blacklisting. From our analysis results, we learn that multi-staged method that combines the data cleansing and the classification via logistic regression or random forest produces the best results. Our evaluation on the real-world data shows that it can reduce the the incorrect blacklisting by nearly 90% when compared to the performance of experts. More over, our proposed model performed well in terms of the time-to-blacklist by curtailing the period of malicious IP address in activity by 27days on average.  2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Jeon, Dooyong; Tak, Byungchul",10.1007/s11276-019-02201-5,journalArticle,EZD6NWIQ,2022,,1

Using electronic health records to accurately predict COVID-19 health outcomes through a novel machine learning pipeline,NO,,,,"Current COVID-19 predictive models primarily focus on predicting the risk of mortality, and rely on COVID-19 specific medical data such as chest imaging after COVID-19 diagnosis. In this project, we developed an innovative supervised machine learning pipeline using longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) to accurately predict COVID-19 related health outcomes including mortality, ventilation, days in hospital or ICU. In particular, we developed unique and effective data processing algorithms, including data cleaning, initial feature screening, vector representation, and feature normalization. Then we trained models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies combined with different parameter settings and feature selection. Based on routinely collected EHR, our machine learning pipeline not only consistently outperformed those developed by other research groups using the same data set, but also achieved similar mortality prediction accuracy as those trained on medical data available only after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, we identified top COVID-19 risk factors, which are consistent with epidemiologic findings.  2021 Owner/Author.","Feng, Alice",10.1145/3459930.3469490,conferencePaper,CPZUVM9N,2021,,1

An Application for Identification of Malignant Weeds in Cereal Fields Based on Neural Network,NO,,,,"In the process of agricultural production, the existence of malignant weeds seriously affects the yield and quality of crops, and especially the malignant weeds represented by Johnson grass, Aegilops tauschii and Nut grass, which are not only extremely similar to crops in morphology, but also have the characteristics of fierce growth and high reproduction rate. In this paper, we designed an image recognition and processing method, especially focusing on the automatic identification and determination of these weeds, in order to solve the defects of low efficiency and error when using manual identification of weeds, and improve the efficiency of weed control in the crop production cycle. Based on deep learning techniques, this study trained the model by means of transfer learning. At the same time, the steps of data processing, such as data collection, data cleaning and purification, as well as the details of model training are listed. On this basis, an application was developed to identify weed species by taking and selecting pictures. Through using cloud computing to improve performance, and to speed up the system, the application can almost achieve 95% identification accuracy.  2021 IEEE.","Zhang, Chao; Fu, Kai; Duan, Zengguanqi; Zhai, Yansong; Tian, Ziping; Huang, Jing",10.1109/ICAIBD51990.2021.9459033,conferencePaper,K5SDHTAI,2021,,1

To predict the stock prices, authors have proposed a technique by first calculating the sentiment scores through Naive Bayes classifier and after that neural network is applied on both sentiment scores and historical stock dataset. They have also addressed the issue of data cleaning using a Hive ecosystem. This ecosystem is being used for pre-processing part and a neural network model with inputs from sentiment analysis and historic data is used to predict the prices. It has been observed from the experiments that the accuracy level reaches above 90% in maximum cases, as well as it also provides the solid base that model will be more accurate if it trained with recent data. The intended combination of sentiment analysis and Neural networks is used to establish a statistical relationship between historic numerical data records of a particular stock and other sentimental factors which can affects the stock prices.","Shastri, M; Roy, S; Mittal, M",10.4108/eai.19-12-2018.156085,journalArticle,PJDGSPTH,2019,,1

Performance evaluation of outlier detection techniques in production timeseries: A systematic review and meta-analysis,YES,ML4DC,tabular,outliers,"Time-series data have been extensively collected and analyzed in many disciplines, such as stock market, medical diagnosis, meteorology, and oil and gas industry. Numerous data in these disciplines are sequence of observations measured as functions of time, which can be further used for different applications via analytical or data analytics techniques (e.g., to forecast future price, climate change, etc.). However, presence of outliers can cause significant uncertainties to interpretation results; hence, it is essential to remove the outliers accurately and efficiently before conducting any further analysis. A total of 17 techniques that belong to statistical, regression-based, and machine learning (ML) based categories for outlier detection in timeseries are applied to the oil and gas production data analysis. 15 of these methods are utilized for production data analysis for the first time. Two state-of-the-art and high-performance techniques are then selected for data cleaning which require minimum control and time complexity. Moreover, performances of these techniques are evaluated based on several metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa to rank the techniques. Results show that eight unsupervised algorithms outperform the rest of the methods based on the synthetic case study with known outliers. For example, accuracies of the eight shortlisted methods are in the range of 0.830.99 with a precision between 0.83 and 0.98, compared to 0.650.82 and 0.070.77 for the others. In addition, ML-based techniques perform better than statistical techniques. Our experimental results on real field data further indicate that the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Fulford-Blasingame methods are superior to other outlier detection frameworks for outlier detection in production data, followed by four others including density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD). Even though the techniques are examined with oil and gas production data, but the same data cleaning workflow can be used to detect timeseries outliers in other disciplines.  2021","Alimohammadi, Hamzeh; Nancy Chen, Shengnan",10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116371,journalArticle,CF22C3TD,2022,aug,1

A Radial Visualisation for Model Comparison and Feature Identification,NO,,,,"Machine Learning (ML) plays a key role in various intelligent systems, and building an effective ML model for a data set is a difficult task involving various steps including data cleaning, feature definition and extraction, ML algorithms development, model training and evaluation as well as others. One of the most important steps in the process is to compare generated substantial amounts of ML models to find the optimal one for the deployment. It is challenging to compare such models with dynamic number of features. This paper proposes a novel visualisation approach based on a radial net to compare ML models trained with a different number of features of a given data set while revealing implicit dependent relations. In the proposed approach, ML models and features are represented by lines and arcs respectively. The dependence of ML models with dynamic number of features is encoded into the structure of visualisation, where ML models and their dependent features are directly revealed from related line connections. ML model performance information is encoded with colour and line width in the innovative visualisation. Together with the structure of visualization, feature importance can be directly discerned to help to understand ML models.  2020 IEEE.","Zhou, Jianlong; Huang, Weidong; Chen, Fang",10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1028,conferencePaper,K7UF8A99,2020,,1
Tackling class overlap and imbalance problems in software defect prediction,NO,,,,"Software defect prediction (SDP) is a promising solution to save time and cost in the software testing phase for improving software quality. Numerous machine learning approaches have proven effective in SDP. However, the unbalanced class distribution in SDP datasets could be a problem for some conventional learning methods. In addition, class overlap increases the difficulty for the predictors to learn the defective class accurately. In this study, we propose a new SDP model which combines class overlap reduction and ensemble imbalance learning to improve defect prediction. First, the neighbor cleaning method is applied to remove the overlapping non-defective samples. The whole dataset is then randomly under-sampled several times to generate balanced subsets so that multiple classifiers can be trained on these data. Finally, these individual classifiers are assembled with the AdaBoost mechanism to build the final prediction model. In the experiments, we investigated nine highly unbalanced datasets selected from a public software repository and confirmed that the high rate of overlap between classes existed in SDP data. We assessed the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods including conventional SDP models, imbalance learning and data cleaning methods. Test results and statistical analysis show that the proposed model provides more reasonable defect prediction results and performs best in terms of G-mean and AUC among all tested models.  2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Chen, Lin; Fang, Bin; Shang, Zhaowei; Tang, Yuanyan",10.1007/s11219-016-9342-6,journalArticle,UIJC2SSI,2018,,1

"Data cleaning for accurate, fair, and robust models: A big data - AI integration approach",YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,,"The wide use of machine learning is fundamentally changing the software development paradigm (a.k.a. Software 2.0) where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. As machine learning is used in sensitive applications, it becomes imperative that the trained model is accurate, fair, and robust to attacks. While many techniques have been proposed to improve the model training process (in-processing approach) or the trained model itself (post-processing), we argue that the most effective method is to clean the root cause of error: the data the model is trained on (pre-processing). Historically, there are at least three research communities that have been separately studying this problem: data management, machine learning (model fairness), and security. Although a significant amount of research has been done by each community, ultimately the same datasets must be preprocessed, and there is little understanding how the techniques relate to each other and can possibly be integrated. We contend that it is time to extend the notion of data cleaning for modern machine learning needs. We identify dependencies among the data preprocessing techniques and propose MLClean, a unified data cleaning framework that integrates the techniques and helps train accurate and fair models.

Yield observation outlier detection with unsupervised machine learning in harvest machines,NO,,,,"Having a reliable yield map is an important key to unlock the value of precision agriculture. This work demonstrates an application of unsupervised machine learning for harvester yield monitoring recovery in the presence of noise for constructing a reliable yield map. The objective of this research is to propose a fully automated statistical and machine learning pipeline to clean primary harvested raw grain observations, regardless of combine series and types. Harvest yield observations are contaminated with different sources of error that obfuscate the spatial structure of the yield observations. The error sources are well-known, mostly inherited from the dynamic nature of operation, speed changes, irregular field topography, non-fully used cutting bar, and start/end delays of headland and filling/emptying times. To identify measurements with such error sources, the proposed pipeline incorporates two processing operations to be applied on the data. The first data cleaning operation is done by setting thresholds based on the lower and upper quartiles as well as the interquartile range (IQR) to detect outliers. In the second operation, the Robust Kernel Outlier Factor (RKOF) is deployed to detect local outliers.

Application of a convolutional neural network for predicting the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia using heart rate variability features,NO,,,,"Predicting the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA) in advance is a matter of utmost importance for saving the lives of cardiac arrhythmia patients. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the occurrence of imminent VTA. In this study, we used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) to extract features from heart rate variability (HRV), thereby to predict the onset of VTA. We also compared the prediction performance of our CNN with other machine leaning (ML) algorithms such as an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), and a k-nearest neighbor (KNN), which used 11 HRV features extracted using traditional methods. The proposed CNN achieved relatively higher prediction accuracy of 84.6%, while the ANN, SVM, and KNN algorithms obtained prediction accuracies of 73.5%, 67.9%, and 65.9% using 11 HRV features, respectively. Our result showed that the proposed 1-D CNN could improve VTA prediction accuracy by integrating the data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, and prediction.","Taye, GT; Hwang, HJ; Lim, KM",10.1038/s41598-020-63566-8,journalArticle,E2M235HF,2020,,1

CounterMiner: Mining Big Performance Data from Hardware Counters,NO,,,,"Modern processors typically provide a small number of hardware performance counters to capture a large number of microarchitecture events. These counters can easily generate a huge amount (e.g., GB or TB per day) of data, which we call big performance data in cloud computing platforms with more than thousands of servers and millions of complex workloads running in a ""24/7/365"" manner. The big performance data provides a precious foundation for root cause analysis of performance bottlenecks, architecture and compiler optimization, and many more. However, it is challenging to extract value from the big performance data due to: 1) the many unperceivable errors (e.g., outliers and missing values); and 2) the difficulty of obtaining insights, e.g., relating events to performance. In this paper, we propose CounterMiner, a rigorous methodology that enables the measurement and understanding of big performance data by using data mining and machine learning techniques. It includes three novel components: 1) using data cleaning to improve data quality by replacing outliers and filling in missing values; 2) iteratively quantifying, ranking, and pruning events based on their importance with respect to performance; 3) quantifying interaction intensity between two events by residual variance. We use sixteen benchmarks (eight from CloudSuite and eight from the Spark version of HiBench) to evaluate CounterMiner. The experimental results show that CounterMiner reduces the average error from 28.3% to 7.7% when multiplexing 10 events on 4 hardware counters. We also conduct a real-world case study, showing that identifying important configuration parameters of Spark programs by event importance is much faster than directly ranking the importance of these parameters.",Y.

Visual Analysis System for Market Sales Data of Agricultural Products,NO,,,,"In order to realize the automation of large data analysis and mining, a series of advanced algorithms, such as data cleaning and clustering, are used to deeply excavate the market sales data of agricultural and sideline products and it provide the necessary data basis for the decision layer of the enterprise. We designed and developed a visual analysis system of market sales data orients to products and business circles in the article.

PhishOut: Effective Phishing Detection Using Selected Features,NO,,,,"Phishing emails are the first step for many of todays attacks. They come with a simple hyperlink, request for action or a full replica of an existing service or website. The goal is generally to trick the user to voluntarily give away his sensitive information such as login credentials. Many approaches and applications have been proposed and developed to catch and filter phishing emails. However, the problem still lacks a complete and comprehensive solution. In this paper, we apply knowledge discovery principles from data cleansing, integration, selection, aggregation, data mining to knowledge extraction. We study the feature effectiveness based on Information Gain and contribute two new features to the literature. We compare six machine-learning approaches to detect phishing based on a small number of carefully chosen features. We calculate false positives, false negatives, mean absolute error, recall, precision and F-measure and achieve very low false positive and negative rates. Naive Bayes has the least true positives rate and overall Neural Networks holds the most promise for accurate phishing detection with accuracy of 99.4%. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Short-term water demand forecast based on automatic feature extraction by one-dimensional convolution,NO,,,,"Short-term water demand forecast is one of the most important technology for urban water supply management. The accuracy and timeliness of the forecast have an important impact. Most of the reported water demand forecast models based on deep learning methods apply a manual features extraction strategy, resulting in incomplete mining of the data and weak model self-adaptability capability. To address these issues, a new framework of short-term water demand forecast is proposed, in which a data preprocessing approach, S-H-ESD (Seasonal Hybrid Extreme Student Deviate), and a forecasting model, Conv1D-GRU (one-dimensional convolution-gated recurrent unit) are mainly developed. Based on the historical monitoring data, different hyper-parameter settings and training strategies were carried out with the proposed models. The results show that the data preprocessing model S-H-ESD can effectively deal with a variety of abnormal values, therefore significantly improving the accuracy of forecast (When the training dataset length is 7 days, the average accuracy of the three models is improved by1.23% when using S-H-ESD method compared with Z-Score method) and the Conv1D-GRU model shows better capability in forecast accuracy and self-adaptability of data features extraction compared with other models in literature (GRUN, ANN). With the achieving optimal parameter setting and training strategy, the developed methodology shows the best forecasted value of MAPE and NSE indicator are 1.677%, 0.983, respectively.","Chen, Lei; Yan, Hexiang; Yan, Jieru; Wang, Jiaying; Tao, Tao; Xin, Kunlun; Li, Shuping; Pu, Zhengheng; Qiu, Jian",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127440,journalArticle,ZPL6Z9H6,2022,,1

Real-time accurate detection of wind turbine downtime - An Irish perspective,NO,,,,"Wind turbines are complex systems that are susceptible to frequent anomalies, faults, and abnormal behaviour. These are caused mainly due to off-nominal conditions, catastrophic events, and major failures, resulting in downtime conditions. An accurate and timely detection of downtime events provides crucial information for planning and decision-making. This study investigates the utility of wind power and wind speed as potential parameters for real-time downtime detection. Early and accurate detection of these anomalies using system outputs collected from monitoring stations is challenging and involved, especially when attempted in real-time. In this article, a real-time downtime detection framework is proposed that maps system outputs to turbine events - faults, scheduled, and unplanned maintenance - through online condition indicators. Without imposing strong distributional assumptions, using available training samples, an optimal, cost-sensitive real-time anomaly detection framework is proposed to determine whether a sample is anomalous. Considering the trade-off between misclassification errors and detection rates, detection studies are performed using wind power and speed - calibrated against available alarm classifiers - obtained from two Irish wind farms. The data cleaning and formatting for analysis was automated and subjected to classification with several levels of complexity. Recursive condition indicators (RCIs) such as Recursive Mahalanobis distance (RMD) and Recursive Residual Error (RRE) are chosen as features for classification. The real-time detection model becomes particularly useful when it is prohibitive to identify in advance the anomalies without a baseline of the system behaviour under such conditions. Case studies involving Irish wind Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) data demonstrate the successful application of the proposed work for early and accurate downtime detection with comparison to a reference machine learning approach.","Mucchielli, P.; Bhowmik, B.; Ghosh, B.; Pakrashi, V.",10.1016/j.renene.2021.07.139,journalArticle,VNSS56NJ,2021,,1
Chapter 8 - Data transformations,NO,,,,"Abstracts There are many transformations that can make real-world datasets more amenable to the learning algorithms discussed in the rest of the book. We first consider methods for attribute selection, which remove attributes that are not useful for the task at hand. Then we look at discretization methods: algorithms for turning numeric attributes into discrete ones. Next we discuss several techniques for projecting data into a space that is more suitable for learning: well-known methods for dimensionality reduction, including unsupervised approaches such as principal component analysis, independent component analysis, and random projections, as well as supervised approaches such as partial least squares regression and linear discriminant analysis. We consider how to turn textual data into numeric attribute vectors so that standard learning techniques can be applied, and present simple methods for approaching time series data. The last four sections deal with data sampling, data cleansing, generic approaches for multiclass classification, and calibration of class probabilities, respectively. Sampling is nontrivial when the data arrives as a stream, and we discuss the “reservoir” method for taking an unbiased sample in this case. Data cleansing can be performed by iteratively applying standard supervised learning algorithms to remove outliers, but there are also dedicated techniques for anomaly detection and so-called “one-class learning” that are applicable. For dealing with multiclass classification problems, we consider several ways of decomposing them into a set of two-class problems, e.g., by applying error-correcting output codes. Finally, we describe how to calibrate class probability estimates to improve their accuracy.","Witten, Ian H.; Frank, Eibe; Hall, Mark A.; Pal, Christopher J.",,bookSection,GMA7ETD2,2017,,1

Automatic extraction of highway light poles and towers from mobile LiDAR data,NO,,,,"Mobile LiDAR has been recently demonstrated as a viable technique for pole-like object detection and classification. Despite that a desirable accuracy (around 80%) has been reported in the existing studies, majority of them were presented in the street level with relatively flat ground and very few of them addressed how to extract the entire pole structure from the ground or curb surface. Therefore, this paper attempts to fill the research gap by presenting a workflow for automatic extraction of light poles and towers from mobile LiDAR data point cloud, with a particular focus on municipal highway. The data processing workflow includes (1) an automatic ground filtering mechanism to separate aboveground and ground features, (2) an unsupervised clustering algorithm to cluster the aboveground data point cloud, (3) a set of decision rules to identify and classify potential light poles and towers, and (4) a least-squares circle fitting algorithm to fit the circular pole structure so as to remove the ground points. The workflow was tested with a set of mobile LiDAR data collected for a section of highway 401 located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The results showed that the proposed method can achieve an over 91% of detection rate for five types of light poles and towers along the study area.","Yan, Wai Yeung; Morsy, Salem; Shaker, Ahmed; Tulloch, Mark",10.1016/j.optlastec.2015.09.017,journalArticle,ENBHT5NC,2016,,1

Data Cleaning of Binary Sensor Events in Activity Recognition by Cluster-Based Methods,Specific,,,,"The Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems use sensors to detect the daily behavior of older adults and provide necessary assistance based on changes in their cognitive status and physical functions, thus enabling older adults to maintain their independence at home. However, the effectiveness of the AAL systems depends on the accuracy of the data provided by sensors. Namely, when a human error or a hardware failure occurs, the activity recognition model can become inaccurate. This inaccuracy hinders the identification of critical and potentially life-threatening activities. Although there are many methods for cleaning sensor data, there is no method for binary sensors deployed in smart homes. By considering noisy sensor events and unintentional forgetting of turning off the device, this paper proposes two clustering-based methods for denoising and splitting binary sensor events to address possible inaccuracy due to the two mentioned problems. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by the experiments using four machine learning models and three real-world smart home datasets and adopting different sensor configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to the original unprocessed datasets, by combining the two proposed methods, the average accuracy and F-measure are improved by 15.00% and 17.25%, respectively.  2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zhao, Chunyang; Que, Xia; Yin, Yue; Xing, Xiaoman; Yang, Jiaoyun; An, Ning",10.1007/978-3-030-78111-8_33,conferencePaper,DR6GYNKQ,2021,,1
RSSI Data Preparation for Machine Learning,Specific,,,,"In this study, we prepared unstructured raw RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) data to prepare it for use in machine learning predictive modeling. RSSI data preparation is very important in predictive modeling machine learning projects, such as classification and regression, so that the algorithm can model it based on the right conditions, because the data has a more specific part but does not necessarily affect the algorithm performance. RSSI data were collected from the Dinamika Bangsa University Campus building, namely 225 reference points. The two main processes involved in data compilation, namely construction data and data cleaning. From the process of identifying a column containing a single RSSI value, several unique values were found in each column in the RSSI data table. Since no column has a Single Value, no columns are deleted. Then in the process of deleting columns that have low RSSI variance, the input is 5969 rows and 18 columns. The output is 5969 rows and 3 columns. However, the number of columns that passed the Low Variance selection was 5969 rows and 18 columns, meaning that all columns in the dataset have high variance. Additionally, no duplicate RSSI data were found. It can be said that the result of the overall preparation of this data set is the RSSI data used in good condition and can be used for machine learning needs.  2020 IEEE.","Abidin, Dodo Zaenal; Nurmaini, Siti; Firsandava Malik, Reza; Erwin; Rasywir, Errissya; Pratama, Yovi",10.1109/ICIMCIS51567.2020.9354273,conferencePaper,2YHZCWSN,2020,,1
Monitoring and modelling of PM2.5 concentration at subway station construction based on IoT and LSTM algorithm optimization,NO,,,,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) generated during construction not only has great influences on the health of the workers, but also has a negative impact on the health of the surrounding public. In-depth study of PM2.5 during construction is of great significance to the environment and human health. Traditional prediction methods have limited consideration of influencing factors and low prediction accuracy. Therefore, this study proposed a Bayesian optimization-based Long Short-Time Method (LSTM) algorithm which can achieve effective PM2.5 prediction at construction sites. In this study, The Internet of Things (IoT) technology was used to conduct real-time monitoring of a subway station construction site in China for 6 months. The PM2.5 concentrations generated by different construction processes were obtained through data cleaning and analysis. The average PM2.5 increments for the excavation and support works, reinforcement works and concrete works were 17 μg/m3, 20 μg/m3, and 21 μg/m3, respectively. After that, feature extraction was performed by the gray correlation algorithm to eliminate redundant information. Then, a Bayesian optimization algorithm was introduced to tune the hyperparameters to optimize the LSTM model performance. Finally, the validity of the proposed model was verified using multiple base models. The results showed that the accuracy of the LSTM model was improved by 6% (R2 from 0.88 to 0.94), after the Bayesian optimization. And the optimized model also has better evaluation indicators, with RMSE = 13.06μg/m3, MAE = 8.61μg/m3. It was proved that the method can effectively predict air pollution.","Guo, Xiaohui; Wang, Yuanfeng; Mei, Shengqi; Shi, Chengcheng; Liu, Yinshan; Pan, Lei; Li, Kai; Zhang, Boqun; Wang, Junshan; Zhong, Zhiwu; Dong, Minzhong",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132179,journalArticle,FAPMQNTL,2022,,1
Learning with Noise: Mask-Guided Attention Model for Weakly Supervised Nuclei Segmentation,NO,,,,"Deep convolutional neural networks have been highly effective in segmentation tasks. However, high performance often requires large datasets with high-quality annotations, especially for segmentation, which requires precise pixel-wise labelling. The difficulty of generating high-quality datasets often constrains the improvement of research in such areas. To alleviate this issue, we propose a weakly supervised learning method for nuclei segmentation that only requires annotation of the nuclear centroid. To train the segmentation model with point annotations, we first generate boundary and superpixel-based masks as pseudo ground truth labels to train a segmentation network that is enhanced by a mask-guided attention auxiliary network. Then to further improve the accuracy of supervision, we apply Confident Learning to correct the pseudo labels at the pixel-level for a refined training. Our method shows highly competitive performance of cell nuclei segmentation in histopathology images on two public datasets.

Automated Feature Engineering using Kernel Functions,NO,,,,"We investigate the potential of using the various kernel functions common to Support Vector Machine(SVM) based modeling from a feature-engineering perspective. Recently, with the advent of Automated Machine Learning, significant research efforts have been placed in areas such as Neural Architecture Search, Hyper Parameter Optimization, Meta Learning, Automated Data Cleaning and Automated Feature Engineering(Auto FE). Auto FE has had some research around automated linear and nonlinear systems feature generation.We have taken a concrete approach towards feature generation taking cue from SVM's kernel tricks which intend to move features from non-linear relationships in lower dimensions to linear relationships in higher dimensions. While the approach was developed for better classification of features in a linear hyperspace, the same technique could be used to assist other classification techniques by auto generating features which add lift to existing feature space.Our approach has had positive uplift for some of the simplistic kernels within SVM literature and has had negative uplift for the more complicated kernel functions.

Study of Data Repetitive Record Cleaning Technology of MES System in High-Tech Process,NO,,,,"High-tech industries such as semiconductors have become important pillars of Taiwans economy under the raging COVID-19 epidemic. The MES system actively collects and monitors the production materials generated in the manufacturing process and integrates the core business required by the companys production such as orders, suppliers, property management, production, equipment maintenance, quality control, and other processes to improve the companys manufacturing process and production efficiency. Big Data of the process is the foundation of information. Good data quality is the basic condition for effective data analysis applications such as OLAP and data mining. The recursive field matching algorithm uses the recursive structure of the text field. The Sorted-Neighborhood Method (SNM) algorithm cannot solve all the matching records detected by a single keyword. Data cleaning is a relatively mature field that expects more breakthroughs and innovations.

Intelligent text mining model for english language using deep neural network,NO,,,,"Today there exist various sources that provide information in very massive amount to serve the demand over the internet, which creates huge collection of heterogeneous data. Thus existing data can be categorized as unstructured and structured data. In this paper we propose an idea of a tool which intelligently preprocesses the unstructured data by segmenting the whole document into number of sentences, using deep learning concepts with word2vec [11] and a Recurrent Neural Network [13]. At the beginning step we use word2vec which was introduced by Tomas Mikolov with his team at Google, to generate vectors of the inputted text content which will be further forwarded to Recurrent Neural Network. RNN takes this series of vectors as input and trained Data Cleaning Recurrent Neural Network model will perform preprocessing task (including cleaning of missing, grammatically incorrect, misspelled data) to produce structured results, which then passed into automatic summarization module to generate desired summary.

Predicting Melancholy risk among IT professionals using Modified Deep Learning Neural Network (MDLNN),NO,,,,"Stress disorders are a widespread problem among IT workers who are now employed in the business. Changing lifestyles and workplace cultures, according to study, increase the likelihood of employees experiencing stress at their jobs. However, regardless of the fact that many companies and sectors provide mental wellbeing system and make attempts to enhance the workplace environment, the problem is far from under control. It is our goal in this paper to employ modified deep learning neural network (MDLNN) approaches to assess stress patterns in IT professionals and to identify the components that are most strongly associated with stress levels. It was decided to use data from the OSMI mental health survey 2017, which included responses from working professionals in the technology industry, to achieve this goal. After thorough data cleaning and preparation, we used a modified deep learning neural network to train our model. The correctness of the models mentioned above was determined and compared to one another. Gender, history of family, and the availability of health benefits in the employment were found to be the most significant factors influencing stress, according to the DLMNN model.

Predictive Maintenance Planning for Industry 4.0 Using Machine Learning for Sustainable Manufacturing,NO,,,,"With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, the application of artificial intelligence in the manufacturing domain is becoming prevalent. Maintenance is one of the important activities in the manufacturing process, and it requires proper attention. To decrease maintenance costs and to attain sustainable operational management, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) has become important in industries. The principle of PdM is forecasting the next failure; thus, the respective maintenance is scheduled before the predicted failure occurs. In the construction of maintenance management, facility managers generally employ reactive or preventive maintenance mechanisms. However, reactive maintenance does not have the ability to prevent failure and preventive maintenance does not have the ability to predict the future condition of mechanical, electrical, or plumbing components. Therefore, to improve the facilities' lifespans, such components are repaired in advance. In this paper, a PdM planning model is developed using intelligent methods. The developed method involves five main phases: (a) data cleaning, (b) data normalization, (c) optimal feature selection, (d) prediction network decision-making, and (e) prediction. Initially, the data pertaining to PdM are subjected to data cleaning and normalization in order to arrange the data within a particular limit. Optimal feature selection is performed next, to reduce redundant information. Optimal feature selection is performed using a hybrid of the Jaya algorithm and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). As the prediction values differ in range, it is difficult for machine learning or deep learning face to provide accurate results. Thus, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to make decisions regarding the prediction network. The SVM identifies the network in which prediction can be performed for the concerned range. Finally, the prediction is accomplished using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In the RNN, the weight is optimized using the hybrid J-SLnO. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can efficiently predict the future condition of components for maintenance planning by using two datasets-aircraft engine and lithium-ion battery datasets.","Abidi, MH; Mohammed, MK; Alkhalefah, H",10.3390/su14063387,journalArticle,ZEF68E2E,2022,,1

A deep learning method to repair atmospheric environmental quality data based on Gaussian diffusion,Specific,,,,"Online monitoring data of atmospheric environmental quality often deviate or are missing, causing a great impact on regional atmospheric quality analysis. In this study, a deep learning method to repair atmospheric environmental quality data based on Gaussian diffusion and gate recurrent unit (GD-GRU) was developed to improve repair accuracy. A multi-source Gaussian diffusion model was developed to estimate PM2.5 based on the pollutant diffusion law and the data of 61 stations in Guilin. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated and observed value was extracted as the error sequence. The error value was regarded as output of gate recurrent unit (GRU) with the inputs of weather and pollutant parameters. Missing data were calculated by Gaussian diffusion estimated value and the error predicted by GRU. The established GD-GRU model was applied to repair the long-sequence missing data. The analytical results indicated that the GD-GRU model had higher prediction accuracy of extreme values than Gaussian diffusion model and GRU model, because GD-GRU based on Gaussian diffusion can calculate the extreme value by simulating the diffusion and transmission mechanism. The established model predicted PM2.5 concentration in the next hours with an RMSE of 12.561, which was approximately 21.02% better, on average, than methods like autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory model (LSTM), and GRU. The established GD-GRU model demonstrated good performance on extreme values prediction and air quality data repair, thus providing a new method for air quality long-sequence missing data repair.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","Xu, Rui; Deng, Xiaoling; Wan, Hang; Cai, Yanpeng; Pan, Xipeng",10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127446,journalArticle,TYRXCM3P,2021,,1

Data Filtering and Deep Learning for Enhanced Human,NO,,,,"Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the most popular research topics. Indeed, recognizing human activities will help provide appropriate assistance to older adults, fighting the consequences of the population aging at the same time. For example, specific organizations, such as United Nations, reported an important risk of qualified human resources shortage to care for older adults in-home care. Hence, HAR solutions based on Ambient Intelligence (AmI) have been proposed to face these consequences. Therefore, we denoted an increasing interest in Ultra-WideBand (UWB) radars for HAR these last years. In this work, we exploited three UWB radars to recognize 15 human activities performed by 9 participants in a prototype apartment. The main contribution in this paper is data cleaning. Indeed, data provided by UWB radars have been cleaned with a band-pass Chebyshev type I filter of order 2. The application of that kind of filter is uncommon in the literature with the data of UWB radars. Also, this filter has been selected according to tests made with different filter types, and classification performances attest that data filtering is efficient. In addition, two different deep learning architectures to classify the cleaned data have been exploited. The first is a relatively simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the second is Efficient-CapsNet. We obtained similar performances between these two architectures for the top-1 with an accuracy of approximately 64%.  2022, The Authors.

A comparative study on the classification performance of machine learning models for academic full texts,NO,,,,"[Objectives] The study aims to compare the classification performance of various machine learning models, explore the classification effects of traditional machine learning models and deep learning models, solve the problem of missing category information of chapter structure in academic literature, promote the retrieval of the content of the specified chapter structure in the academic literature, and automatically extract and customize the formation of specific text services. [Methodology] 31,888 academic articles in the journal ""PLOS ONE"" were selected. After data cleaning and segmentation, a text classification corpus containing 313,952 chapter structure category information was constructed. Based on traditional machine learning models NB, SVM, CRF, and the deep learning model RNN model group, Bi-LSTM model group, IDCNN model group, BERT model group, a total of 17 machine learning models were used to carry out chapter structure division experiment. [Results] Among the classification tasks, the BERT-Bi-LSTM-CRF model has the best classification performance, with an average F value of 71.18%, which is 0.51% and 3.31% higher than the second CRF and the third Bi-LSTM-CRF, respectively. For deep learning models, the use of BERT for text representation is better than word2vec. Adding the Attention mechanism and replacing the Softmax layer with the CRF layer can achieve better classification results. In addition, the online version of the Chapter Structure Recognition Presentation and Application Platform has been developed, which can visually display the overall situation of the research and the model training process, and can realize machine learning and deep learning models such as NB, SVM, CRF, Bi-LSTM, IDCNN.

Realization of automatic data cleaning and feedback conditioning for J-TEXT ECEI signals based on machine learning,NO,,,,"In recent years, Electron Cyclotron Emission Imaging (ECEI) diagnostics and many other imaging diagnostics have become increasingly important in magnetic confinement fusion research. When the image quality becomes worse due to bad pixels, it becomes an important issue for imaging diagnostics. To automatically identify and classify abnormal ECEI signals, a classification algorithm for ECEI signals based on machine learning was developed for the J-TEXT ECEI diagnostic. Incorporated with the digital control function of J-TEXT ECEI, the channels of low-attenuation saturated signals and weak signals can be corrected by adjusting the attenuation levels. At present, the automatic data cleaning and feedback conditioning unit has been set up and applied to the J-TEXT ECEI. The accuracy rate of the classification algorithm on the external test dataset reaches 93.8%. Feedback conditioning can be completed between two discharge shots.

A Clinical Decision Support System for Diabetes Patients with Deep Learning: Experience of a Taiwan Medical Center,NO,,,,"Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem worldwide. It involves dysfunction of blood sugar regulation resulting from insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, or excessive glucagon secretion. Methods: This study collated 971,401 drug usage records of 51,009 DM patients. These data include patient identification code, age, gender, outpatient visiting dates, visiting code, medication features (included items, doses, and frequencies of drugs), HbA1c results, and testing time. We apply a random forest (RF) model for feature selection and implement a regression model with the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) deep learning architecture. Finally, we use the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index for the prediction model. Results: After data cleaning, the data included 8,729 male and 9,115 female cases. Metformin was the most important feature suggested by the RF model, followed by glimepiride, acarbose, pioglitazone, glibenclamide, gliclazide, repaglinide, nateglinide, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin. The model performed better with the past two seasons in the training data than with additional seasons. Further, the Bi-LSTM architecture model performed better than support vector machines (SVMs). Discussion & Conclusion: This study found that Bi-LSTM models is a well kernel in a CDSS which help physicians' decision-making, and the increasing the number of seasons will negative impact the performance. In addition, this study found that the most important drug is metformin, which is recommended as first-line treatment OHA in various situations for DM patients.","Chien, TY; Ting, HW; Chen, CF; Yang, CZ; Chen, CY",10.7150/ijms.71341,journalArticle,T7HCPYIG,2022,,1
Data Cleaning of Irrelevant Images Based on Transfer Learning,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,outliers,"Considering that there are many irrelevant images in the image data set crawled from the Internet, this paper proposes a new method of cleaning irrelevant images data based on transfer learning. The method consists of two steps that can be done iteratively. Firstly, we use transfer learning to train and get a better image classifier, which makes the single image's recognition effect more accurate. Besides, according to the number of different types of images in the data set, we calculate and determine the threshold value of the image of the minority class and then clean them accordingly. We find that our method can improve the test accuracy of the original data set on VGG16, VGG19, and Inception v3 from 37.41%, 40.62%, and 49.37% to 50.07%, 53.89%, and 65.16%, respectively.

An empirical study of GUI widget detection for industrial mobile games,NO,,,,"With the widespread adoption of smartphones in our daily life, mobile games experienced increasing demand over the past years. Meanwhile, the quality of mobile games has been continuously drawing more and more attention, which can greatly affect the player experience. For better quality assurance, general-purpose testing has been extensively studied for mobile apps. However, due to the unique characteristic of mobile games, existing mobile testing techniques may not be directly suitable and applicable. To better understand the challenges in mobile game testing, in this paper, we first initiate an early step to conduct an empirical study towards understanding the challenges and pain points of mobile game testing process at our industrial partner NetEase Games. Specifically, we first conduct a survey from the mobile test development team at NetEase Games via both scrum interviews and questionnaires. We found that accurate and effective GUI widget detection for mobile games could be the pillar to boost the automation of mobile game testing and other downstream analysis tasks in practice. We then continue to perform comparative studies to investigate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art general-purpose mobile app GUI widget detection methods in the context of mobile games. To this end, we also develop a technique to automatically collect GUI widgets region information of industrial mobile games, which is equipped with a heuristic-based data cleaning method for quality refinement of the labeling results. Our evaluation shows that: (1) Existing GUI widget detection methods for general-purpose mobile apps cannot perform well on industrial mobile games. (2) Mobile game exhibits obvious difference from other general-purpose mobile apps in the perspective GUI widgets. Our further in-depth analysis reveals high diversity and density characteristics of mobile game GUI widgets could be the major reasons that post the challenges for existing methods, which calls for new research methods and better industry practices. To enable further research along this line, we construct the very first GUI widget detection benchmark, specially designed for mobile games, incorporating both our collected dataset and the state-of-the-art widget detection methods for mobile apps, which could also be the basis for further study of many downstream quality assurance tasks (e.g., testing and analysis) for mobile games.  2021 ACM.","Ye, Jiaming; Chen, Ke; Xie, Xiaofei; Ma, Lei; Huang, Ruochen; Chen, Yingfeng; Xue, Yinxing; Zhao, Jianjun",10.1145/3468264.3473935,conferencePaper,LSZNIZVA,2021,,1

Driver identification by neural network on extracted statistical features from smartphone data,NO,,,,"The future of transportation is driven by the use of artificial intelligence to improve living and transportation. This paper presents a neural network-based system for driver identification using data collected by a smartphone. This system identifies the driver automatically, reliably and in real-time without the need for facial recognition and also does not violate privacy. The system architecture consists of three modules data collection, preprocessing and identification. In the data collection module, the data of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors are collected using a smartphone. The preprocessing module includes noise removal, data cleaning, and segmentation. In this module, lost values will be retrieved and data of stopped vehicle will be deleted. Finally, effective statistical properties are extracted from data-windows. In the identification module, machine learning algorithms are used to identify drivers patterns. According to experiments, the best algorithm for driver identification is MLP with a maximum accuracy of 96%. This solution can be used in future transportation to develop driver-based insurance systems as well as the development of systems used to apply penalties and incentives.MSC Codes 97Rxx Copyright  2020, The Authors.

A framework for cardiac arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs,NO,,,,"Cardiac arrhythmia has been identified as a type of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that causes approximately 12% of all deaths globally. The development of Internet-of-Things has spawned novel ways for heart monitoring but also presented new challenges for manual arrhythmia detection. An automated method is highly demanded to provide support for physicians. Current attempts for automatic arrhythmia detection can roughly be divided as feature-engineering based and deep-learning based methods. Most of the feature-engineering based methods are suffering from adopting single classifier and use fixed features for classifying all five types of heartbeats. This introduces difficulties in identification of the problematic heartbeats and limits the overall classification performance. The deep-learning based methods are usually not evaluated in a realistic manner and report overoptimistic results which may hide potential limitations of the models. Moreover, the lack of consideration of frequency patterns and the heart rhythms can also limit the model performance. To fill in the gaps, we propose a framework for arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs. The framework consists of two modules: a data cleaning module and a heartbeat classification module. Specifically, we propose two solutions for the heartbeat classification task, namely Dynamic Heartbeat Classification with Adjusted Features (DHCAF) and Multi-channel Heartbeat Convolution Neural Network (MCHCNN). DHCAF is a feature-engineering based approach, in which we introduce dynamic ensemble selection (DES) technique and develop a result regulator to improve classification performance. MCHCNN is deep-learning based solution that performs multi-channel convolutions to capture both temporal and frequency patterns from heartbeat to assist the classification. We evaluate the proposed framework with DHCAF and with MCHCNN on the well-known MIT-BIH-AR database, respectively. The results reported in this paper have proven the effectiveness of our framework.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","He, Jinyuan; Rong, Jia; L., Sun; H., Wang; Y., Zhang; J., Ma",10.1007/s11280-019-00776-9,journalArticle,9E5K7G42,2020,,1
Research on Construction and Automatic Expansion of Multi-source Lexical Semantic Knowledge Base,NO,,,,"With the development of research on improving the performance of deep learning models in combination with the rich knowledge resources in traditional knowledge bases, more and more research on building knowledge bases has become a hot topic. How to use the rich semantic information of existing knowledge bases such as HowNet and Tongyici-Cilin to build a more comprehensive and higher quality knowledge graph has become the focus of scholars' research. In this work, we propose a way to integrate a variety of knowledge base information to build a new knowledge base, combined with deep learning techniques to expand the knowledge base. Successfully build a multi-source lexical semantic knowledge base through the steps of new ontology construction, data cleaning and fusion, and new knowledge expansion. Based on the establishment of the knowledge base, we use the graph database and JavaScript script to store and visualize the data separately. Through experiments, we obtained a lexical semantic knowledge base containing 153754 nodes, 1598356 triples and 137 relationships. It can provide accurate and convenient knowledge services, and can use a large number of semantic knowledge resources to support research on semantic retrieval, intelligent question answering system, semantic relationship extraction, semantic relevance calculation and ontology automatic construction [1].","Zhu, SQ; Li, Y; Shao, YQ",10.1007/978-981-15-1956-7_7,conferencePaper,UJ72A34X,2019,,1

Generating real-world evidence from unstructured clinical notes to examine clinical utility of genetic tests: use case in BRCAness,NO,,,,"Background: Next-generation sequencing provides comprehensive information about individuals' genetic makeup and is commonplace in oncology clinical practice. However, the utility of genetic information in the clinical decision-making process has not been examined extensively from a real-world, data-driven perspective. Through mining real-world data (RWD) from clinical notes, we could extract patients' genetic information and further associate treatment decisions with genetic information. Methods: We proposed a real-world evidence (RWE) study framework that incorporates context-based natural language processing (NLP) methods and data quality examination before final association analysis. The framework was demonstrated in a Foundation-tested women cancer cohort (N = 196). Upon retrieval of patients' genetic information using NLP system, we assessed the completeness of genetic data captured in unstructured clinical notes according to a genetic data-model. We examined the distribution of different topics regarding BRCA1/2 throughout patients' treatment process, and then analyzed the association between BRCA1/2 mutation status and the discussion/prescription of targeted therapy. Results: We identified seven topics in the clinical context of genetic mentions including: Information, Evaluation, Insurance, Order, Negative, Positive, and Variants of unknown significance. Our rule-based system achieved a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.93 and F-measure of 0.91. Our machine learning system achieved a precision of 0.901, recall of 0.899 and F-measure of 0.9 for four-topic classification and a precision of 0.833, recall of 0.823 and F-measure of 0.82 for seven-topic classification. We found in result-containing sentences, the capture of BRCA1/2 mutation information was 75%, but detailed variant information (e.g. variant types) is largely missing. Using cleaned RWD, significant associations were found between BRCA1/2 positive mutation and targeted therapies. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrated a framework to generate RWE using RWD from different clinical sources. Rule-based NLP system achieved the best performance for resolving contextual variability when extracting RWD from unstructured clinical notes. Data quality issues such as incompleteness and discrepancies exist thus manual data cleaning is needed before further analysis can be performed. Finally, we were able to use cleaned RWD to evaluate the real-world utility of genetic information to initiate a prescription of targeted therapy.","Zhao, YQ; Weroha, SJ; Goode, EL; Liu, HF; Wang, C",10.1186/s12911-020-01364-y,journalArticle,C8XWYH5I,2021,,1

Aurora Image Classification Robust to Noise Labels,NO,,,,"In recent years, a lot of researcher has analyzed a shape of aurora from aurora images using machine learning. In particular, a number of studies have shown that convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used to classify aurora images with high accuracy. We analyzed aurora images and found that there is a certain amount of mislabeled data in aurora datasets. As this labeling error causes the difficulty in judging the shape of aurora, it is important for aurora image classification to assign accurate labels to aurora images. However, the shape of aurora is ambiguous and it is very difficult to label the aurora image accurately. We think that these mislabeled data are hindering aurora image analysis. In this study, we propose a classification method and a CNN training method that reduces the effect of mislabeled data. Specifically, we used Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) for aurora image classification instead of a final layer of a pre-trained CNN model. In addition, we propose a simple method for determining mislabeled data. Using a combination of these two methods to automatically classify aurora images, we achieved an F1 score of 0.945 for an aurora image dataset with four labels: arc aurora, drapery, hot-spot and radial, an improvement of 0.2 over traditional CNN-based classification.","Endo, T; Matsumoto, M; IEEE",10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589435,conferencePaper,LDZSUSYR,2021,,1

Robust Deep Learning Ensemble against Deception [arXiv],NO,,,,"Deep neural network (DNN) models are known to be vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial examples and to out-of-distribution inputs drawn sufficiently far away from the training data. How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This paper presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs. Evaluated using eleven popular adversarial attacks and two representative out-of-distribution datasets, we show that XEnsemble achieves a high defense success rate against adversarial examples and a high detection success rate against out-of-distribution data inputs, and outperforms existing representative defense methods with respect to robustness and defensibility.",Wenqi Wei; Ling Liu,,journalArticle,QUGEDDVG,2020,,1

Data cleansing for models trained with SGD,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,features,"Data cleansing is a typical approach used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models, which, however, requires extensive domain knowledge to identify the influential instances that affect the models. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can suggest influential instances without using any domain knowledge. With the proposed method, users only need to inspect the instances suggested by the algorithm, implying that users do not need extensive knowledge for this procedure, which enables even non-experts to conduct data cleansing and improve the model. The existing methods require the loss function to be convex and an optimal model to be obtained, which is not always the case in modern machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach specifically designed for the models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method infers the influential instances by retracing the steps of the SGD while incorporating intermediate models computed in each step. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately infer the influential instances. Moreover, we used MNIST and CIFAR10 to show that the models can be effectively improved by removing the influential instances suggested by the proposed method. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Cleaning StackOverflow for Machine Translation,NO,,,,"Generating source code API sequences from an English query using Machine Translation (MT) has gained much interest in recent years. For any kind of MT, the model needs to be trained on a parallel corpus. In this paper we clean StackOverflow, one of the most popular online discussion forums for programmers, to generate a parallel English-Code corpus from Android posts. We contrast three data cleaning approaches: standard NLP, title only, and software task extraction. We evaluate the quality of the each corpus for MT. To provide indicators of how useful each corpus will be for machine translation, we provide researchers with measurements of the corpus size, percentage of unique tokens, and per-word maximum likelihood alignment entropy. We have used these corpus cleaning approaches to translate between English and Code [22, 23], to compare existing SMT approaches from word mapping to neural networks [24], and to re-examine the ""natural software"" hypothesis [29]. After cleaning and aligning the data, we create a simple maximum likelihood MT model to show that English words in the corpus map to a small number of specific code elements. This model provides a basis for the success of using StackOverflow for search and other tasks in the software engineering literature and paves the way for MT.

Combining Oversampling with Recurrent Neural Networks for Intrusion Detection,NO,,,,"Previous studies on intrusion detection focus on analyzing features from existing datasets. With various types of fast-changing attacks, we need to adapt to new features for effective protection. Since the real network traffic is very imbalanced, its essential to train appropriate classifiers that can deal with rare cases. In this paper, we propose to combine oversampling techniques with deep learning methods for intrusion detection in imbalanced network traffic. First, after preprocessing with data cleaning and normalization, we use feature importance weights generated from ensemble decision trees to select important features. Then, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used for creating synthetic samples from minority class. Finally, we use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for classification. In our experimental results, oversampling improves the performance of intrusion detection for both machine learning and deep learning methods. The best performance can be obtained for CIC-IDS2017 dataset using LSTM classifier with an F1-score of 98.9%, and for CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset using GRU with an F1-score of 98.8%. This shows the potential of our proposed approach in detecting new types of intrusion from imbalanced real network traffic.  2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Wang, Jenq-Haur; Septian, Tri Wanda",10.1007/978-3-030-73216-5_21,conferencePaper,AW9VXZWF,2021,,1
Anomaly detection of electricity load data based on MixMatch,NO,,,,"With the development of power industry, electricity has become one of the most important energy sources in our country, related to the lifeline of the country's economy. The electricity system is becoming more and more mature, but abnormal electricity consumption behaviors are also emerging endlessly, causing potential safety hazards in the electricity industry and even the electricity supply system. Considering the lack of abnormal annotations in the electricity load data, this paper proposes a semi-supervised electricity load data anomaly detection method based on MixMatch. Firstly, data cleaning of electricity load data is used to remove incorrect data. Secondly, Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is used to extract its time-domain and frequency-domain features separately, and the features are combined through feature fusion. Thirdly, the Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline-SMOTE) is used to solve the problem of data imbalance. The MixMatch semi-supervised algorithm is used to label the abnormal data to realize the anomaly detection of the electricity load data. Finally, this paper uses the k-means clustering and T-Stochastic neighbour Embedding (T -SNE) to classify the abnormal data and visualize the data. The experimental results show that, compared with traditional machine learning methods, the proposed method has a significant improvement on AUC.  2021 IEEE.","Sun, Shijun; Zhou, Yatong; He, Hao; He, Jingfei; Chi, Yue",10.1109/ICCEAI52939.2021.00010,conferencePaper,Q7H49NJD,2021,,1

AI-Based Heterogenous Large-Scale English Translation Strategy,NO,,,,"English has become one of the most widely used languages in the world. If there is no good translation mechanism for such a widely used language, it will bring trouble to both study and life. At present, the world's major platforms are committed to the study of English translation strategies. There are translation platforms from different regions and different translation mechanisms. These translation data from different translation platforms have the characteristics of large-scale, multisource, heterogeneity, high dimensions, and poor quality. However, such inconsistent translation data will increase the translation difficulty and translation time. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of translation data to achieve a better translation effect. How to provide a large-scale and efficient translation strategy needs to integrate the translation strategies of various platforms to perform heterogeneous translation data cleaning and fusion based on machine learning. At first, this paper represents the multisource, heterogeneous translation data model as tree-augmented naive Bayes networks (TANs) and naturally captures the relationship between the datasets through the learning of TANs structure and the probability distribution of input attributes and tuples, using data probability value to complete the classification of translation data cleaning. Then, a multisource, heterogeneous translation data fusion model based on recurrent neural network (RNN) is constructed, and RNN is used to control the node data of hidden layer to enhance the fault-tolerant ability in the fusion process and complete the construction of fusion model. Finally, experimental results show that TANs-based translation data cleaning method can effectively improve the cleaning rate with an average improvement of approximately 10% and cleaning time with an average reduce about 5%. In addition, RNN-based multisource translation data fusion method improves the shortcomings of the traditional fusion model and improves the practicability of the fusion model in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), fusion time, and integrity.  2022 Hindawi Limited.

Real-time network intrusion detection system based on deep learning,NO,,,,"Computer network is vulnerable to hackers, computer viruses, and other malicious attacks. As an active defense technology, intrusion detection plays an important role in the field of network security. Traditional intrusion detection technologies face problems such as low accuracy, low detection efficiency, high false positive rate, and inability to cope with new types of intrusions. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time network intrusion detection system based on deep learning, which uses big data technology, natural language processing technology and deep learning technology. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) Use Flume as the agent for log collection to realize real-time massive log collection, using Flink as real-time computation engine. (2) Aiming at the high dimensional problem of traffic data, a self-encoder-based intrusion detection dimension reduction method is proposed, and the intrusion detection data is preprocessed, including data cleaning, coding, extraction and integration, and normalization. (3) Propos a deep learning-based intrusion detection model, AE-AlexNet, which uses Auto-Encoder AlexNet neural network. The experimental results of the intrusion detection data set KDD 99 show that the accuracy of the AE-AlexNet, model is as high as 94.32%.  2019 IEEE.","Dong, Yuansheng; Wang, Rong; He, Juan",10.1109/ICSESS47205.2019.9040718,conferencePaper,PP45MP6M,2019,,1

⋆This paper has been handled by associate editor Tony Sze.The application of novel connected vehicles emulated data on real-time crash potential prediction for arterials,NO,,,,"Real-time crash potential prediction could provide valuable information for Active Traffic Management Systems. Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.","Li, Pei; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed; Cai, Qing; Yuan, Cheng",10.1016/j.aap.2020.105658,journalArticle,I2FRQ5DH,2020,,1

DR-TSP: A Data Repairing Framework for Time Synchronization Problems in ERI Data,NO,,,,"Timestamps are often problematic in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems due to time synchronization problems of distributed radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers or sensors. This issue may seriously affect the data quality in some fields, such as transportation. A typical IoT application in transportation is electronic registration identification of the motor vehicle (ERI), an emerging traffic data acquisition technology based on RFID. ERI data play a vital role in intelligent transportation. However, the data quality is often affected seriously by the inaccurate timestamps, which arise from the time-unsynchronized distributed ERI readers. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework, data repairing of time synchronization problems (DR-TSP), which can detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and correct timestamp-deviated ERI data. Precisely, DR-TSP consists of three components. Problem reader discovery component employs a statistics-based method to detect the time-unsynchronized ERI readers and discovers the clock leaps of the problematic ERI reader through a smoothing-based method. Travel-time estimation component constructs a spatial correlative travel-time estimation model based on the neural network to infer timestamp deviation. The influence of clock deviation is considered in the model training. Data correction component utilizes the above results to correct the timestamp-deviated data. Experiments over large-scale ERI data collected from a big China city, Chongqing, show that our method can significantly improve data quality.  2014 IEEE.","Xia, Dong; Zheng, Linjiang; Chen, Li; Liu, Weining; Sun, Dihua",10.1109/JIOT.2021.3058640,journalArticle,KXYIXIHW,2021,,1

Explanations for Data Repair through Shapley Values,NO,,,,"Data repair, i.e., the identification and fix of errors in the data, is a central component of the Data Science cycle. As such, significant research effort has been devoted to automate the repair process. Yet it still requires significant manual labor by the Data Scientists, tweaking and optimizing repair modules (up to 80% of their time, according to surveys). To this end, we propose in this paper a novel framework for explaining the results of any data repair module. Explanations involve identifying the table cells and database constraints having the strongest influence on the process. Influence, in turn, is quantified through the game-theoretic notion of Shapley values, commonly used for explaining Machine Learning classifier results. The main technical challenge is that exact computation of Shapley values incurs exponential time. We consequently devise and optimize novel approximation algorithms, and analyze them both theoretically and empirically. Our results show the efficiency of our approach when compared to the alternative of adapting existing Shapley value computation techniques to the data repair settings.  2021 ACM.","Deutch, Daniel; Frost, Nave; Gilad, Amir; Sheffer, Oren",,bookSection,2AHIJMA4,2021,,1

FAIR1M: A benchmark dataset for fine-grained object recognition in high-resolution remote sensing imagery,NO,,,,"With the rapid development of deep learning, many deep learning based approaches have made great achievements in object detection task. It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven method. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some limitations in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale benchmark on object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. We collected remote sensing images with a resolution of 0.3m to 0.8m from different platforms, which are spread across many countries and regions. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 sub-categories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the quantity of instances and the quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution, (4) it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel evaluation method and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a visual classification task using several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep learning based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results strongly indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is considerably more challenging than existing datasets. Researchers can better investigate fine-grained object detection algorithms with the help of the FAIR1M dataset. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Prediction of shale-gas production at duvernay formation using deep-learning algorithm,NO,,,,"Decline-curve analysis (DCA) is an easy and fast empirical regression method for predicting future well production. However, applying DCA to shale-gas wells is limited by long transient flow, a unique completion design, and high-density drilling. Recently, a long shortterm- memory (LSTM) algorithm has been widely applied to the prediction of time-series data. Because shale-gas-production data are time-series data, the LSTM algorithm can be applied to predict future shale-gas production. After information for 332 shale-gas wells in Alberta, Canada, is obtained from a commercial database, the data are preprocessed in seven steps, including cutoffs for well list, data cleaning, feature extraction, train and test sets split, normalization, and sorting for input into the LSTM model. The LSTM model is trained in 405 seconds by two features of production data and a shut-in (SI) period from 300 wells. The two-feature case shows a better prediction accuracy than both the one-feature case (i.e., production data only) and the hyperbolic DCA, where the three methods are tested on unseen data from 15 wells. The two-feature case can predict future production rates according to the SI period and provide a stable result for available time-series data.  2019 Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Lee, Kyungbook; Lim, Jungtek; Yoon, Daeung; Jung, Hyungsik",10.2118/195698-PA,journalArticle,7X3VJCJS,2019,,1

Research on Identification of Chronic Disease Using Automated Machine Learning,NO,,,,"Identification of people at risk of chronic diseases at an early stage are of great significance.

However, the accuracy of machine learning algorithm is closely related to the parameters of the model, which also restricts the application of machine learning in chronic disease prediction. In view of the above problems, this paper designs a solution to automatically predict the risk of chronic diseases based on Auto-Sklearn, evaluates and compares the models trained by Sklearn and Auto-Sklearn, and the accuracy of the model trained by Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) reaches 89.6%, which verifies the high performance of AutoML model.

Poisoning attacks on machine learning models in cyber systems and mitigation strategies,related,,,,"Poisoning attacks on training data are becoming one of the top concerns among users of machine learning systems. The goal of such attacks is to inject a small set of maliciously mislabeled training data into the training pipeline so as to detrimentally impact a machine learning model trained on such data. Constructing such attacks for cyber applications is especially challenging due to their realizability constraints. Furthermore, poisoning mitigation techniques for such applications are also not well understood. This paper investigates techniques for realizable data poisoning availability attacks (using several cyber applications), in which an attacker can insert a set of poisoned samples at the training time with the goal of degrading the accuracy of the deployed model. We design a white-box, realizable poisoning attack that degraded the original model's accuracy by generating mislabeled samples in close vicinity of a selected subset of training points. We investigate this strategy and its modifications for key classifier architectures and provide specific implications for each of them. The paper also proposes a novel data cleaning method as a defense against such poisoning attacks. Our defense includes a diversified ensemble of classifiers, each trained on a different subset of the training set. We use the disagreement of the classifiers' predictions as a decision whether to keep a given sample in the training dataset or remove it. The results demonstrate the efficiency of this strategy with very limited performance penalty.  2022 SPIE","Izmailov, Rauf; Venkatesan, Sridhar; Reddy, Achyut; Chadha, Ritu; De Lucia, Michael J.; Oprea, Alina",10.1117/12.2622112,conferencePaper,WKZYE9RN,2022,,1
A Novel Predictive Scheme for Confirming State of Bipolar Disorder using Recurrent Decision Tree,NO,,,,"Bipolar disorder is one of the most challenging illnesses where medical science is still struggling to achieve its landmark therapies. After reviewing existing prediction-based approaches towards investigating bipolar disorder, it is noted that existing approaches are more or less symptomatic and relates depression as sadness. It implies various theories that don't consider many precise indicators of confirming bipolar disorder. Therefore, this manuscript presents a novel framework capable of treating the dataset of depression and fine-tune it appropriately to subject it further to a machine learning-based predictive scheme. The proposed system subjects its dataset for a series of data cleaning operations followed by data preprocessing using a standard scale of rating bipolar level. Further usage of feature engineering and correlation analysis renders more contextual inference towards its statistical score. The proposed system also introduces a Recurrent Decision Tree that further contributes towards the predictive outcome of bipolar disorder.

Data Improving in Time Series Using ARX and ANN Models,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,features,"Anomalous data can negatively impact energy forecasting by causing model parameters to be incorrectly estimated. This paper presents two approaches for the detection and imputation of anomalies in time series data. Autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are used to extract the characteristics of time series. Anomalies are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals, and the anomalous data points are imputed using the ARX and ANN models. Because the anomalies affect the model coefficients, the data cleaning process is performed iteratively. The models are re-learned on “cleaner” data after an anomaly is imputed. The anomalous data are reimputed to each iteration using the updated ARX and ANN models. The ARX and ANN data cleaning models are evaluated on natural gas time series data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed approaches are able to identify and impute anomalous data points. Forecasting models learned on the unclean data and the cleaned data are tested on an uncleaned out-of-sample dataset. The forecasting model learned on the cleaned data outperforms the model learned on the unclean data with 1.67% improvement in the mean absolute percentage errors and a 32.8% improvement in the root mean squared error.

Big Data Cleaning Based on Mobile Edge Computing in Industrial Sensor-Cloud,NO,,,,"With the advent of 5G, the industrial Internet of Things has developed rapidly. The industrial sensor-cloud system (SCS) has also received widespread attention. In the future, a large number of integrated sensors that simultaneously collect multifeature data will be added to industrial SCS. However, the collected big data are not trustworthy due to the harsh environment of the sensor. If the data collected at the bottom networks are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, the query and data mining results will be inaccurate, which will seriously affect the judgment and feedback of the cloud. The traditional method of relying on sensor nodes for data cleaning is insufficient to deal with big data, whereas edge computing provides a good solution. In this article, a new data cleaning method is proposed based on the mobile edge node during data collection. An angle-based outlier detection method is applied at the edge node to obtain the training data of the cleaning model, which is then established through support vector machine. Besides, online learning is adopted for model optimization. Experimental results show that multidimensional data cleaning based on mobile edge nodes improves the efficiency of data cleaning while maintaining data reliability and integrity, and greatly reduces the bandwidth and energy consumption of the industrial SCS.","Wang, T; Ke, HX; Zheng, X; Wang, K; Sangaiah, AK; Liu, AF",10.1109/TII.2019.2938861,journalArticle,TK26HALI,2020,,1

A natural language processing and deep learning approach to identify child abuse from pediatric electronic medical records,NO,,,,"Child physical abuse is a leading cause of traumatic injury and death in children. In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record-including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers-to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms-Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB)-and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90 +/- 0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93 +/- 0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77 +/- 0.04 and average ROCAUC 0.81 +/- 0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings.

Integrating multiple methods to enhance medical data classification,NO,,,,"In medical data classification, data reduction and improving classification performance are the important issues in the current scenario. In existing medical data classification methods, initially, the medical data pre-processing is performed. After pre-processing feature selection is performed, otherwise, the process is more time consuming and has poor accuracy. Here we have proposed two algorithms for enhancing the classification performance on medical data. In first proposed method Bag of Words technique is used for better feature subset selection. Subsequently, the hybrid Fuzzy-Neural Network approach used that can handle imprecision in data while classification. This combination of feature selection technique and Fuzzy-Neural Network classifier approach gives enhanced classification accuracy. In the second proposed algorithm, we have integrated data cleaning technique to improve data quality as pre-processing technique along with bag of words and Fuzzy-Neural Network, this method performs classification on clean filtered data with appropriately reduced feature set that results in more accurate classification than the existing methods. Thus in proposed approaches we have tried to handle three issues, removing noise in data, optimal feature subset selection and handling imprecision in data. The comparative study of various medical datasets in terms of accuracy shows that the two proposed algorithms perform better as compared to existing techniques and the enhancement obtained is around 3% and 17% respectively. In addition the performance of Bag of Words feature selection method used in the proposed system is compared with two feature selection methods LSFS and SFFS.","Tarle, B.; Chintakindi, S.; Jena, S.",10.1007/s12530-019-09272-x,journalArticle,UE2PJAYA,2020,,1

Reservoir ranking map sketching for selection of infill and replacement drilling locations using machine learning technique,NO,,,,"Infill and replacement drilling are effective ways to improve oil recovery as increasingly more wells are drilled in close proximity for fracturing. Presently, the approaches being employed are logging surveys, the moving window method, the rapid inversion method, and the customized type curve method. However, these methods are not suitable for reservoirs with high levels of heterogeneity in terms of geology, and require more expert knowledge and field survey, which can be time consuming and costly. Therefore, the present method developed is an economic and fast approach to determine infill and replacement drilling location from reservoir ranking maps generated in combination with machine learning methods. During this project, production data and reservoir parameters were gathered from an old oil field with more than 2,500 wells where most of the field was under water injection. Bubble maps were created for each reservoir parameter for a better visual representation of reservoir conditions. Then, after data cleansing and normalization procedures, the standout attributes were identified from all given reservoir parameters and production history and a reservoir ranking rule was set. Next, five types of classification approaches were used for prediction. This paper additionally presents a regression method, artificial neural network (ANN), to compare with the prediction results from classification. For each machine learning technique, a reserve ranking map was generated for this test field to predict future infill drilling and replacement drilling opportunities. Thus, with only geographic coordinates, the reserve ranking level was obtained. From cross-fold validation results, a quadratic support vector machine provides the highest prediction accuracy. From a practical standpoint, a decision tree offers a more realistic result. In addition to the ANN method outputs, the ranking result provides a smooth method between certain levels. This new approach of using artificial intelligence was used to provide the ranking level and ranking number to identify the best options for drilling the wells, which is different from the present traditional methods. This advanced reservoir ranking map allows operators to identify the best location for infill or replacement drilling. It can additionally help operators benefit from their previously gathered knowledge in a cost-effective way.

Predictive regression modeling with MEG/EEG: from source power to signals and cognitive states,NO,,,,"Predicting biomedical outcomes from Magnetoencephalography and Electroencephalography (M/EEG) is central to applications like decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning. Yet, most of the literature is concerned with classification of outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the subject-level, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset. Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and ground-truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level, the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the models across different data cleaning options. Environmental denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were strikingly robust and continued performing well even without preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche: supervised spatial filtering is practical for event-level prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple end-to-end learning.","Sabbagh, David; Ablin, Pierre; Varoquaux, Gaël; Gramfort, Alexandre; Engemann, Denis A.",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116893,journalArticle,6CGBLH8I,2020,,1
Deep learning disease prediction model for use with intelligent robots,NO,,,,"Deep learning applications with robotics contribute to massive challenges that are not addressed in machine learning. The present world is currently suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and millions of lives are getting affected every day with extremely high death counts. Early detection of the disease would provide an opportunity for proactive treatment to save lives, which is the primary research objective of this study. The proposed prediction model caters to this objective following a stepwise approach through cleaning, feature extraction, and classification. The cleaning process constitutes the cleaning of missing values ,which is proceeded by outlier detection using the interpolation of splines and entropy-correlation. The cleaned data is then subjected to a feature extraction process using Principle Component Analysis. A Fitness Oriented Dragon Fly algorithm is introduced to select optimal features, and the resultant feature vector is fed into the Deep Belief Network. The overall accuracy of the proposed scheme experimentally evaluated with the traditional state of the art models. The results highlighted the superiority of the proposed model wherein it was observed to be 6.96% better than Firefly, 6.7% better than Particle Swarm Optimization, 6.96% better than Gray Wolf Optimization ad 7.22% better than Dragonfly Algorithm.","Koppu, Srinivas; Maddikunta, Praveen Kumar Reddy; Srivastava, Gautam",10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106765,journalArticle,HJKWU4WM,2020,,1

Data management for structural integrity assessment of offshore wind turbine support structures: data cleansing and missing data imputation,NO,,,,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Condition Monitoring (CM) Systems are currently utilised to collect data from offshore wind turbines (OWTs), to enhance the accurate estimation of their operational performance. However, industry accepted practices for effectively managing the information that these systems provide have not been widely established yet. This paper presents a four-step methodological framework for the effective data management of SHM systems of OWTs and illustrates its applicability in real-time continuous data collected from three operational units, with the aim of utilising more complete and accurate datasets for fatigue life assessment of support structures. Firstly, a time-efficient synchronisation method that enables the continuous monitoring of these systems is presented, followed by a novel approach to noise cleansing and the posterior missing data imputation (MDI). By the implementation of these techniques those data-points containing excessive noise are removed from the dataset (Step 2), advanced numerical tools are employed to regenerate missing data (Step 3) and fatigue is estimated for the results of these two methodologies (Step 4). Results show that after cleansing, missing data can be imputed with an average absolute error of 2.1%, while this error is kept within the [+ 15.2%−11.0%] range in 95% of cases. Furthermore, only 0.15% of the imputed data fell outside the noise thresholds. Fatigue is found to be underestimated both, when data cleansing does not take place and when it takes place but MDI does not. This makes this novel methodology an enhancement to conventional structural integrity assessment techniques that do not employ continuous datasets in their analyses.","Martinez-Luengo, Maria; Shafiee, Mahmood; Kolios, Athanasios",10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.01.003,journalArticle,VRBLPAG3,2019,,1

They are even being tested in safety-critical systems, thanks to recent breakthroughs in deep learning and reinforcement learning. Many people are now interacting with systems based on ML every day, e.g., voice recognition systems used by virtual personal assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. As the field of ML continues to grow, we are likely to witness transformative advances in a wide range of areas, from finance, energy, to health and transportation. Given this growing importance of ML-based systems in our daily life, it is becoming utterly important to ensure their reliability. Recently, software researchers have started adapting concepts from the software testing domain (e.g., code coverage, mutation testing, or property-based testing) to help ML engineers detect and correct faults in ML programs. This paper reviews current existing testing practices for ML programs. First, we identify and explain challenges that should be addressed when testing ML programs. Next, we report existing solutions found in the literature for testing ML programs. Finally, we identify gaps in the literature related to the testing of ML programs and make recommendations of future research directions for the scientific community. We hope that this comprehensive review of software testing practices will help ML engineers identify the right approach to improve the reliability of their ML-based systems. We also hope that the research community will act on our proposed research directions to advance the state of the art of testing for ML programs.  2020","Braiek, Houssem Ben; Khomh, Foutse",10.1016/j.jss.2020.110542,journalArticle,LZUHSJI8,2020,,1

Probabilistic outlier detection for sparse multivariate geotechnical site investigation data using Bayesian learning,Specific,,,,"Various uncertainties arising during acquisition process of geoscience data may result in anomalous data instances (i.e., outliers) that do not conform with the expected pattern of regular data instances. With sparse multivariate data obtained from geotechnical site investigation, it is impossible to identify outliers with certainty due to the distortion of statistics of geotechnical parameters caused by outliers and their associated statistical uncertainty resulted from data sparsity. This paper develops a probabilistic outlier detection method for sparse multivariate data obtained from geotechnical site investigation. The proposed approach quantifies the outlying probability of each data instance based on Mahalanobis distance and determines outliers as those data instances with outlying probabilities greater than 0.5. It tackles the distortion issue of statistics estimated from the dataset with outliers by a re-sampling technique and accounts, rationally, for the statistical uncertainty by Bayesian machine learning. Moreover, the proposed approach also suggests an exclusive method to determine outlying components of each outlier. The proposed approach is illustrated and verified using simulated and real-life dataset. It showed that the proposed approach properly identifies outliers among sparse multivariate data and their corresponding outlying components in a probabilistic manner. It can significantly reduce the masking effect (i.e., missing some actual outliers due to the distortion of statistics by the outliers and statistical uncertainty). It also found that outliers among sparse multivariate data instances affect significantly the construction of multivariate distribution of geotechnical parameters for uncertainty quantification. This emphasizes the necessity of data cleaning process (e.g., outlier detection) for uncertainty quantification based on geoscience data.","Zheng, Shuo; Zhu, Yu-Xin; Li, Dian-Qing; Cao, Zi-Jun; Deng, Qin-Xuan; Phoon, Kok-Kwang",10.1016/j.gsf.2020.03.017,journalArticle,5L3LMCD8,2021,,1

Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Standard Insights Extraction Pipeline for Bantu Languages,NO,,,,"Extracting insights from data obtained from the web in order to identify peoples views and opinions on various topics is a growing practice. The standard insights extraction pipeline is typically an unsupervised machine learning task composed of processes that preprocess the text, visualize it, cluster and identify the topics and sentiment in each cluster, and then graph the network. Given the increasing amount of data being generated on the internet in Africa today, and the multilingual state of African countries, we evaluated how well the standard pipeline works when applied to text wholly or partially written in indigenous African languages, specifically Bantu languages. We carried out an exploratory investigation using Twitter data and compared the outputs from each step of the pipeline for an English dataset and a mixed Bantu language dataset. We found that for Bantu languages, due to their complex grammatical structure, extra preprocessing steps such as part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis are required during data cleaning, threshold values should be adjusted during topic modeling, and semantic analysis should be performed before completing text preprocessing.  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nchabeleng, Mathibele; Byamugisha, Joan",10.1007/978-3-030-45439-5_11,conferencePaper,R84U7N45,2020,,1

Interactive label cleaning with example-based explanations,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,label,"We tackle sequential learning under label noise in applications where a human supervisor can be queried to relabel suspicious examples. Existing approaches are flawed, in that they only relabel incoming examples that look ""suspicious"" to the model. As a consequence, those mislabeled examples that elude (or don't undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data and the model with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose CINCER, a novel approach that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of mutually incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example, CINCER identifies a counter-example in the training set that-according to the model-is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks the annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible inconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so to serve as explanations of the model's suspicion, and highly influential, so to convey as much information as possible if relabeled. CINCER achieves this by leveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the counter-examples helps in acquiring substantially better data and models, especially when paired with our FIM approximation.

Methods and analysis We will employ machine-learning classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests) to create an asthma attack risk prediction model, using the Asthma Learning Health System (ALHS) study patient registry comprising 500 000 individuals across 75 Scottish general practices, with linked longitudinal primary care prescribing records, primary care Read codes, accident and emergency records, hospital admissions and deaths. Models will be compared on a partition of the dataset reserved for validation, and the final model will be tested in both an unseen partition of the derivation dataset and an external dataset from the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Effectiveness II (SIVE II) study. Ethics and dissemination Permissions for the ALHS project were obtained from the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 02 [16/SS/0130] and the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care (1516-0489). Permissions for the SIVE II project were obtained from the Privacy Advisory Committee (National Services NHS Scotland) [68/14] and the National Research Ethics Committee West Midlands-Edgbaston [15/WM/0035].

A general machine learning framework for solving real applications with a texture perception case study,NO,,,,"Machine learning, especially deep learning, has made great achievements in application domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, etc. This great success not only depends on the progress of model design but also on the emergence of large-scale annotated benchmark datasets. However, in some application domains, it is difficult to apply machine learning methods to solve the new arising problems due to the lack of standardized and annotated datasets. People have to find their way from the very beginning of the data collecting, cleaning, and labeling. Unfortunately, there is not a guiding framework to deal with such a situation. This paper pays attention to it and proposes a general machine learning framework to solve the pratical problems from the scratch. It contains two main stages implemented by an unsupervised clustering method and a semi-supervised learning method representatively. In the first stage, an unsupervised clustering method is utilized to find representative data samples which are more important and can be used to do data cleaning and manual labeling. In the second stage, a semi-supervised method is adopted to predict the labels for the rest data samples and to construct a larger annotated dataset. A case study in the texture perception field has been done to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed application framework.  2021 IEEE.","Zhang, Qin; Liu, Jing; Sun, Huali; Liu, Jun",10.1109/ICIVC52351.2021.9526959,conferencePaper,5URM4HAT,2021,,1

Solar thermal generation forecast via deep learning and application to buildings cooling system control,NO,,,,"Reliable prediction of solar thermal power is essential for optimal operation and control of renewable energy driven distributed power systems. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based multivariate approach for forecasting power generation from solar thermal collectors over multiple horizons simultaneously. It also demonstrates an application of solar thermal power generation forecasting in a building cooling system as part of a predictive central controller. Historical data from an evacuated collector field and a single axis tracking collector field have been used to develop the prediction models and assess the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides accurate prediction for multiple forecast horizons: MAPE is 2.99%–4.18% for 30 min to 24 h ahead prediction. The proposed approach utilising both historical and predicted future weather data achieves 25%–37% improvements of accuracy compared to its univariate counterpart that uses only lagged power data as input. It also outperforms existing data driven approaches based on NNs, LSTM, and RF, and achieves 5.46%–21.28% statistically significant improvements compared to them.","Rana, Mashud; Sethuvenkatraman, Subbu; Heidari, Rahmat; Hands, Stuart",10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.005,journalArticle,AYFLMBBE,2022,,1
Machine learning application to estimate missing rock mechanical logs and reduce uncertainty while drilling,NO,,,,"This study presents a data-driven approach using machine learning algorithms to provide predicted analogues in the absence of acoustic logs, especially while drilling. Acoustic logs are commonly used to derive rock mechanical properties; however, these data are not always available. Well logging data (wireline/logging while drilling - LWD), such as gamma ray, density, neutron porosity, and resistivity, are used as input parameters to develop the data-driven rock mechanical models. In addition to the logging data, real-time drilling data (i.e., weight-on-bit, rotation speed, torque, rate of penetration, flowrate, and standpipe pressure) are used to derive the model. In the data preprocessing stage, we labeled drilling and well logging data based on formation tops in the drilling plan and performed data cleansing to remove outliers. A set of field data from different wells across the same formation is used to build and train the predictive models. We computed feature importance to rank the data based on the relevance to predict acoustic logs and applied feature selection techniques to remove redundant features that may unnecessarily require a more complex model. An additional feature, mechanical specific energy, is also generated from drilling real-time data to improve the prediction accuracy. A number of scenarios showing a comparison of different predictive models were studied, and the results demonstrated that adding drilling data and/or feature engineering into the model could improve the accuracy of the models.  2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Negara, Ardiansyah; Magana-Mora, Arturo; Khan, Khaqan; Vossen, Johannes; Zhan, Guodong David; Otalvora, William Contreras; Bomidi, John",10.2118/205638-MS,conferencePaper,IJSFYVRR,2021,,1

Stock price forecasting model analysis based on the wavelet neural network and the data cleaning technology,NO,,,,"Financial time arrangement, for example, stock cost and trade rates are, regularly, non-straight and non-stationary. Beforehand, numerous scientists have endeavored to conjecture those utilizing factual models and machine learning models. Measurable models expect the time arrangement to be stationary and straight, accordingly bringing about expansive factual mistakes. Examination and expectation of securities exchange time arrangement information has pulled in impressive enthusiasm from the exploration group in the course of the most recent decade. Quick advancement and development of modern calculations for measurable examination of time arrangement information, and accessibility of elite equipment has made it conceivable to prepare and dissect high volume securities exchange time arrangement information successfully, continuously. In monetary field, exceptions speak to unpredictability of securities exchange, which assumes an imperative part in administration, portfolio choice and subordinate evaluating. Along these lines, anticipating anomalies of securities exchange is of the immense significance in principle and application. In this paper, the issue of anticipating anomalies in light of versatile gathering models of Intense Erudition Machines (IEMs) is considered.

Leveraging Lead Bias for Zero-shot Abstractive News Summarization,NO,,,,"A typical journalistic convention in news articles is to deliver the most salient information in the beginning, also known as the lead bias. While this phenomenon can be exploited in generating a summary, it has a detrimental effect on teaching a model to discriminate and extract important information in general. We propose that this lead bias can be leveraged in our favor in a simple and effective way to pre-train abstractive news summarization models on large-scale unlabeled news corpora: predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an article. We collect a massive news corpus and conduct data cleaning and filtering via statistical analysis. We then apply self-supervised pre-training on this dataset to existing generation models BART and T5 for domain adaptation. Via extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, we show that this approach can dramatically improve the summarization quality and achieve state-of-the-art results for zero-shot news summarization without any fine-tuning. For example, in the DUC2003 dataset, the ROUGE-1 score of BART increases 13.7% after the lead-bias pre-training. We deploy the model in Microsoft News and provide public APIs as well as a demo website for multi-lingual news summarization.  2021 ACM.","Zhu, Chenguang; Yang, Ziyi; Gmyr, Robert; Zeng, Michael; Huang, Xuedong",10.1145/3404835.3462846,conferencePaper,LNIBFD6X,2021,,1

Time Series Segmentation of Flood Flow Based on Bi-LG-LSTM Neural Network,NO,,,,"With fast development of big data technology, how to mine useful information from a large amount of time series data is an important task in hydrology. Such process of information mining should be built on the basis of pre-processing, including data cleaning, aligning, segmentation and so on. In this paper, we mainly focus on an efficient algorithm to accurately segment time sequences in hydrology domain. Although traditional methods of time series segmentation can segment time series easily, there are three drawbacks in traditional methods; First, traditional segmentation methods pay more attention to the evaluation of the compression ratio and the fitting rate, but ignore the accuracy of segmentation points; Secondly, traditional segmentation methods do not take the information of time series data itself into account, such as it is easy to divide a whole time series into two time series segments, which leads to losing semantic information in time series analysis. Finally, in these traditional evaluations of time series segmentation, the number of segments and the position of the segmentation points are not comprehensively taken into account. In this paper, we propose a time series segmentation method based on Bi-LG-LSTM neural network, which is modified on the base of the LSTM/Bi-LSTM neural network. Through the supervised learning method on flood flow data sets, we can extract a large number of effective segments of the time series. Meanwhile, we propose a novel evaluation method, which utilizes the dynamic DTW distance method to evaluate the results of the time series segmentation method. The evaluation method takes the position of segmentation points and the number of time series segments into consideration. Experiments on the flood flow time series show that our proposed method has an obvious effect.  2020 IEEE.","Feng, Jun; Wang, Haohang; Wu, Yirui",10.1109/ICCCBDA49378.2020.9095566,conferencePaper,YHXZICWT,2020,,1

Deep reinforcement learning for syntactic error repair in student programs,NO,,,,"Novice programmers often struggle with the formal syntax of programming languages. In the traditional classroom setting, they can make progress with the help of real time feedback from their instructors which is often impossible to get in the massive open online course (MOOC) setting. Syntactic error repair techniques have huge potential to assist them at scale. Towards this, we design a novel programming language correction framework amenable to reinforcement learning. The framework allows an agent to mimic human actions for text navigation and editing. We demonstrate that the agent can be trained through self-exploration directly from the raw input, that is, program text itself, without either supervision or any prior knowledge of the formal syntax of the programming language. We evaluate our technique on a publicly available dataset containing 6975 erroneous C programs with typographic errors, written by students during an introductory programming course. Our technique fixes 1699 (24.4%) programs completely and 1310 (18.8%) program partially, outperforming DeepFix, a state-of-the-art syntactic error repair technique, which uses a fully supervised neural machine translation approach.  2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Ensemble Learning Models Based on Noninvasive Features for Type 2 Diabetes Screening: Model Development and Validation,NO,,,,"Background: Early diabetes screening can effectively reduce the burden of disease. However, natural population-based screening projects require a large number of resources. With the emergence and development of machine learning, researchers have started to pursue more flexible and efficient methods to screen or predict type 2 diabetes. Objective: The aim of this study was to build prediction models based on the ensemble learning method for diabetes screening to further improve the health status of the population in a noninvasive and inexpensive manner. Methods: The dataset for building and evaluating the diabetes prediction model was extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011-2016. After data cleaning and feature selection, the dataset was split into a training set (80%, 2011-2014), test set (20%, 2011-2014) and validation set (2015-2016). Three simple machine learning methods (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest) and easy ensemble methods were used to build diabetes prediction models. The performance of the models was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. The Delong test (2-sided) was used to test the performance differences between the models. Results: We selected 8057 observations and 12 attributes from the database. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the three simple methods yielded highly predictive performance models with areas under the curve (AUCs) over 0.800, wherein the ensemble methods significantly outperformed the simple methods. When we evaluated the models in the test set and validation set, the same trends were observed. The ensemble model of linear discriminant analysis yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.849, an accuracy of 0.730, a sensitivity of 0.819, and a specificity of 0.709 in the validation set. Conclusions: This study indicates that efficient screening using machine learning methods with noninvasive tests can be applied to a large population and achieve the objective of secondary prevention.","Yang, TZ; Zhang, L; Yi, LW; Feng, HW; Li, SM; Chen, HY; Zhu, JF; Zhao, J; Zeng, YY; Liu, HS",10.2196/15431,journalArticle,JCA8DQMQ,2020,,1
Prediction and Optimization of WAG Flooding by Using LSTM Neural Network Model in Middle East Carbonate Reservoir,NO,,,,"Production prediction continues to play an increasingly significant role in reservoir development adjustment and optimization, especially in water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding. As artificial intelligence continues to develop, data-driven machine learning method can establish a robust model based on massive data to clarify development risks and challenges, predict development dynamic characteristics in advance. This study gathers over 15 years actual data from targeted carbonate reservoir and establishes a robust Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network prediction model based on correlation analysis, data cleaning, feature variables selection, hyper-parameters optimization and model evaluation to forecast oil production, gas-oil ratio (GOR), and water cut (WC) of WAG flooding. In comparison to traditional reservoir numerical simulation (RNS), LSTM neural networks have a huge advantage in terms of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The calculation time of LSTM method is 864% less than reservoir numerical simulation method, while prediction error of LSTM method is 261% less than RNS method. We classify producers into three types based on the prediction results and propose optimization measures aimed at the risks and challenges they faced. Field implementation indicates promising outcome with better reservoir support, lower GOR, lower WC, and stabler oil production. This study provides a novel direction for application of artificial intelligence in WAG flooding development and optimization.

Relevant-features based Auxiliary Cells for Energy Efficient Detection of Natural Errors,NO,,,,"Deep neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on many classification tasks. However, they have no inherent capability to recognize when their predictions are wrong. There have been several efforts in the recent past to detect natural errors but the suggested mechanisms pose additional energy requirements. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble of classifiers at hidden layers to enable energy efficient detection of natural errors. In particular, we append Relevant-features based Auxiliary Cells (RACs) which are class specific binary linear classifiers trained on relevant features. The consensus of RACs is used to detect natural errors. Based on combined confidence of RACs, classification can be terminated early, thereby resulting in energy efficient detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on various image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Quantum machine learning for quantum anomaly detection,NO,,,,"Anomaly detection is used for identifying data that deviate from ""normal"" data patterns. Its usage on classical data finds diverse applications in many important areas such as finance, fraud detection, medical diagnoses, data cleaning, and surveillance. With the advent of quantum technologies, anomaly detection of quantum data, in the form of quantum states, may become an important component of quantum applications. Machine-learning algorithms are playing pivotal roles in anomaly detection using classical data. Two widely used algorithms are the kernel principal component analysis and the one-class support vector machine. We find corresponding quantum algorithms to detect anomalies in quantum states. We show that these two quantum algorithms can be performed using resources that are logarithmic in the dimensionality of quantum states. For pure quantum states, these resources can also be logarithmic in the number of quantum states used for training the machine-learning algorithm. This makes these algorithms potentially applicable to big quantum data applications.  2018 American Physical Society.","Liu, Nana; Rebentrost, Patrick",10.1103/PhysRevA.97.042315,journalArticle,FEKKBZJV,2018,,1

Consequently, various methods have been proposed that correct imbalanced datasets such as under-sampling, over-sampling, ensemble-based methodologies, and cost-sensitive learning. However, the lack of information triggers the under-sampling and over-sampling to endure higher runtime and potential overfitting. Also, there is a disadvantage for a cost-sensitive method to handle insufficiently specified costs. To solve this issue, a new hybrid HUSCSLBoost framework has been proposed to manipulate imbalanced data through three key steps: data cleaning, data balancing, and cost accumulation. HUSCSLBoost uses Tomek-Link algorithms for eliminating noise data in the first stage and then creates several balanced subsets applying the random under-sampling. Finally, the CSLBoost method involves each balance subsets like any boost iteration, such as RUSBoost. The inclusion of a cost concept into the value update calculation for each case is based on its hardness to minimize the lack of information introduced by undertaking tests. HUSCSBoost was applied to 27 imbalanced datasets, and the outcome is considerably better than the current best-performing RUSBoost method.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Hasib, Khan Md.; Showrov, Md.

Automatic Composition and Optimization of Multicomponent Predictive Systems With an Extended Auto-WEKA,NO,,,,"Composition and parameterization of multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) consisting of chains of data transformation steps are a challenging task. Auto-WEKA is a tool to automate the combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter (CASH) optimization problem. In this paper, we extend the CASH problem and Auto-WEKA to support the MCPS, including preprocessing steps for both classification and regression tasks. We define the optimization problem in which the search space consists of suitably parameterized Petri nets forming the sought MCPS solutions. In the experimental analysis, we focus on examining the impact of considerably extending the search space (from approximately 22000 to 812 billion possible combinations of methods and categorical hyperparameters). In a range of extensive experiments, three different optimization strategies are used to automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available data sets. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial for different predictive models. We also present the results on seven data sets from real chemical production processes. Our findings can have a major impact on the development of high-quality predictive models as well as their maintenance and scalability aspects needed in modern applications and deployment scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The extension of Auto-WEKA to compose and optimize multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) developed as part of this paper is freely available on GitHub under GPL license, and we encourage practitioners to use it on a broad variety of classification and regression problems. The software can either be used as a blackbox-where search space is made of all possible WEKA filters, predictors, and metapredictors (e.g., ensembles)-or as an optimization tool on a subset of preselected machine learning methods. The application has a graphical user interface, but it can also run from command line and can be embedded in any project as a Java library. There are three main outputs once an Auto-WEKA run has finished: 1) the trained MCPS ready to make predictions on unseen data; 2) the WEKA configuration (i.e., parameterized components); and 3) the Petri net in a Petri Net Markup Language format that can be analyzed using any tool supporting this standard language. There are, however, some practical considerations affecting the quality of the results that must be taken into consideration, such as the CPU time budget or the search starting point. These are extensively discussed in this paper.",M. Martin Salvador; M. Budka; B. Gabrys,10.1109/TASE.2018.2876430,journalArticle,AXV2FFMW,2019,,1

Robust learning model of wind turbine power curve based on operational data,NO,,,,"The power curve of a wind turbine is an important performance indicator to characterize the operating status of the turbine, and plays an important role in the control, maintenance and management of wind farms. However, due to the influence of abnormal data and power-limited data, the power curve built directly on the original data will greatly deviate from the normal power curve, resulting in huge errors in actual use. The traditional approach is to clean the wind speed-power data before fitting the power curve, but the data cleaning algorithm is often inefficient and prone to over-cleaning. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust learning model for wind turbine power curves, which directly builds power curves on top of abnormal and power-limited data to significantly improve the efficiency of power curve modeling. Firstly, various parametric methods such as and non-parametric methods are used to fit the power curve, and the influence of abnormal data on the accuracy of the fitted curve is analyzed; secondly, the role of robustness of the loss function in BP neural network model training is analyzed, and changing the loss function to improve the accuracy of the fitted curve of the neural network is proposed; finally, model evaluation criteria are established, and by comparing with a variety of commonly used power curve fitting methods, the proposed The proposed robust power curve fitting model takes longer time but has obvious advantages of fitting effect, and shows its better adaptability.",Z.

Application of KNN and Decision Tree Classification Algorithms in the Prediction of Education Success from the Edu720 Platform,NO,,,,"Data mining is the process of knowledge discovery in a certain amount of data. Knowledge discovery in data reflects in the application of sophisticated machine learning methods such as regression, classification, clustering, etc. The focus of this study is the analysis of data from the real production system called Edu720, which is intended for internal education of employees in companies and which is used by numerous companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its region. A complex process of data preprocessing, including data cleaning and data transformation, was applied to the considered data set so it can be used in numerous classification tasks. The main goal of this study is to predict the success of the education that the company wants to set up for its employees. Information such as the number of questions in education, the average number of words per question in certain education, the number of employees and the duration of the educational video resource represented in seconds were used as attributes for applied classification methods. Class output represents the level of success for certain educations. K-nearest neighbors and decision tree algorithms were used for classification tasks and the accuracy of the classification was determined by the holdout method. The influence of applying the more sophisticated method for data set partitioning, which uses the K-means clustering method, is also presented.","Dervisevic, O.; Zunic, E.; Eonko, D.; Buza, E.",10.23919/SpliTech.2019.8783102,conferencePaper,G4Z2BER8,2019,,1
Unsupervised density-based machine learning for abnormal leveling signatures detection,NO,,,,"The Semiconductor industry relies on the metrology to keep up with a highly competitive production environment and technology ramp up. To reduce metrology costs without degrading quality we propose to use sensors data such as scanner leveling data as a new way to detect maverick lots and wafers enabling a smarter measurement sampling scheme.

Then the pre-processed data are used to feed an unsupervised density based machine learning algorithm (DBSCAN) that can detect outliers as an human expert would.

Improving maritime traffic emission estimations on missing data with CRBMs,NO,,,,"Maritime traffic emissions are a major concern to governments as they heavily impact the Air Quality in coastal cities. Ships use the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to continuously report position and speed among other features, and therefore this data is suitable to be used to estimate emissions, if it is combined with engine data. However, important ship features are often inaccurate or missing. State-of-the-art complex systems, like CALIOPE at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, are used to model Air Quality. These systems can benefit from AIS based emission models as they are very precise in positioning the pollution. Unfortunately, these models are sensitive to missing or corrupted data, and therefore they need data curation techniques to significantly improve the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a methodology for treating ship data using Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) plus machine learning methods to improve the quality of data passed to emission models that can also be applied to other GPS and time-series problems. Results show that we can improve the default methods proposed to cover missing data. In our results, we observed that using our method the models boosted their accuracy to detect otherwise undetectable emissions. In particular, we used a real data-set of AIS data, provided by the Spanish Port Authority, to estimate that thanks to our method, the model was able to detect 45% of additional emissions, representing 152 tonnes of pollutants per week in Barcelona and propose new features that may enhance emission modeling.","Gutierrez-Torre, Alberto; Berral, Josep Ll.; Buchaca, David; Guevara, Marc; Soret, Albert; Carrera, David",10.1016/j.engappai.2020.103793,journalArticle,NSD947S8,2020,,1

FRIEND: Feature selection on inconsistent data,NO,,,,"With the explosive growth of information, inconsistent data are increasingly common. However, traditional feature selection methods are lack of efficiency due to inconsistent data repairing beforehand. Therefore, it is necessary to take inconsistencies into consideration during feature selection to not only reduce time costs but also guarantee accuracy of machine learning models. To achieve this goal, we present FRIEND, a feature selection approach on inconsistent data. Since features in consistency rules have higher correlation with each other, we aim to select a specific amount of features from these. We prove that the specific feature selection problem is NP-hard and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach.  2020","Qi, Zhixin; Wang, Hongzhi; He, Tao; Li, Jianzhong; Gao, Hong",10.1016/j.neucom.2020.01.094,journalArticle,FKYBELM8,2020,,1
W2WNET: A two-module probabilistic Convolutional Neural Network with embedded data cleansing functionality,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,features,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are supposed to be fed with only high-quality annotated datasets. Nonetheless, in many real-world scenarios, such high quality is very hard to obtain, and datasets may be affected by any sort of image degradation and mislabelling issues. This negatively impacts the performance of standard CNNs, both during the training and the inference phase. To address this issue we propose Wise2WipedNet (W2WNet), a new two-module Convolutional Neural Network, where a Wise module exploits Bayesian inference to identify and discard spurious images during the training, and a Wiped module takes care of the final classification, while broadcasting information on the prediction confidence at inference time. The goodness of our solution is demonstrated on a number of public benchmarks addressing different image classification tasks, as well as on a real-world case study on histological image analysis. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that W2WNet is able to identify image degradation and mislabelling issues both at training and at inference time, with positive impact on the final classification accuracy.  2021, CC BY.","Ponzio, Francesco; Macii, Enrico; Ficarra, Elisa; Di Cataldo, Santa",,journalArticle,92G7GMQ3,2021,aug,1

It is difficult to manually relabel due to huge amounts of data. In addition, there are much more problems due to the similarity of sounds that are difficult to manually distinguish and label sound data.

In order to extract compact features from audio, densely connected layer with log scaled Mel-spectrogram is used. Data selection is performed based on the Euclidean distance of each Best matching unit (BMU) derived through the SOM. We also experiment with various grid sizes for SOM to find an efficient grid size. In addition, an appropriate distance finding experiment is conducted.

Chapter 8 - Machine learning in life cycle assessment,NO,,,,"Machine learning (ML) has been used in life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the values of environmental impact characterization factors and to conduct sensitivity analyses.

Outside of LCA, applications of ML algorithms have included data cleaning, predicting system output flows or performance, ecosystem informatics, and system optimization. Considering these uses and capabilities of ML, opportunities exist for using ML in cleaning data for life cycle inventories (LCI), estimating flow data for unit processes, improving the quality and quantity of data used to determine impact characterization factors, and generating inventory data for scenario analyses. In this chapter, we introduce LCA and ML, look at how ML has been used in LCA and in development of surrogate LCAs, and discuss other applications that could inform future ML-based tools for LCA.","Algren, Mikaela; Fisher, Wendy; Landis, Amy E.",,bookSection,Z8ZUQ9AC,2021,,1

Micro agent and neural network based model for data error detection in a real time data stream,NO,,,,"In this paper, we present a model for learning and detecting the presence of data type errors in a real time big data stream processing context. The proposed approach is based on a collection of micro-agents. Each micro-agent is trained to detect a specific type of error using an atomic neural network based on a sample multilayer perceptron. The supervised learning process is based on a binary classifier where the training data inputs are represented by data types and data values. The Micro-Agent for Error Detection (MAED) is deployed at several instances depending on the number of error types to be handled. The orchestration mechanism of data streams to be examined is performed by a special Host Micro Agent (HMA). This later receives in real time a data stream, splits the current record into several elementary fields. Each field value is streamed to an instance of MAED Agent which responds with a signal of presence or not of a specific data type error of the corresponding data field. For each detected data type error, the HMA Agent selects and performs the appropriate cleaning algorithm from a repository to correct the present errors of the data stream. To validate this approach, we propose an implementation based on Framework Deep Learning 4j for the Machines Learning part and JADE as a Multi Agent System (MAS) platform. The used dataset is generated by an events generator for smart highways.","Snineh, S.M.; Youssfi, M.; Daaif, A.; Bouattane, O.",,journalArticle,AURPDKLI,2019,,1

Construction of visualization domain-specific knowledge graph of crop diseases and pests based on deep learning,NO,,,,"The knowledge graph describes the concepts, entities, and their relationships in the objective world in a structured form. It has a better ability to organize, manage, and understand massive amounts of information, and can structure heterogeneous knowledge in the field. It can be widely used in medical, biological, financial, etc. In view of the current situation in the field of crop diseases and insect pests, there are multiple relationship pairs between the same entity and multiple entities, multi-source heterogeneous data, poor aggregation ability, low utilization, and the possibility of knowledge sharing. Combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining technologies, this study focused on data acquisition, ontology construction, knowledge extraction, and knowledge storage, researched on the construction of crops diseases and insect pests knowledge graph based on deep learning. Firstly, this study used the Scrapy crawler framework of the Python programming language to crawl data from web pages related to crop diseases and insect pests, and performed data cleaning and data supplementation through data preprocessing methods. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the domain corpus, the Protege ontology construction tool was used to complete the semi-automatic construction of the crop diseases and insect pests ontology predefined the set of properties and relations and set the corresponding domains and ranges. Then, based on the ontology, the rule method was used to extract semi-structured knowledge, and the deep learning method was used to extract unstructured knowledge. In the process of unstructured knowledge extraction, a text annotation mode ""Main_Entity+Relation+BIESO"" (ME+R+BIESO) adapted to the domain corpus was also proposed. Based on a predefined set of relationships, entities and relationships were simultaneously annotated, it contained entity and relationship information at the same time, and directly modeling the triples instead of separately modeling entities and relationships. The corresponding triples were also directly obtained through analysis, which not only saved at least half of the cost of labeling but also realized the joint extraction of entity relations and solved the problem of overlapping relation extraction. And this study used the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)- Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)+ Conditional Random Field (CRF) end-to-end model to experiment on the crop diseases and insect pests dataset. First, this study used the BERT pre-training language model to encode words, extracted text features, and used the generated vector as the input of the BiLSTM layer; BiLSTM integrated contextual information into the model at the same time, and performed bidirectional encoding to achieve effective prediction of label sequences; finally, this study used the CRF module to decode the output result of BiLSTM, and the label transition probability and constraint conditions were obtained through training and learning, and the entity label category of each character was obtained. The experimental results showed that the precision was 94.06%, the recall was 89.02%, and the F1 value reached 91.34%, which was much better than the pipeline method and classic models such as BiLSTM+CRF and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)+BiLSTM+CRF in the joint extraction method. The joint extraction of entity relations based on this annotation mode not only improved the efficiency and accuracy of annotation but also solved the problem of overlapping relations in the corpus. Finally, the extracted knowledge was stored in the graph database to realize the visual display of the knowledge graph and deep knowledge mining and reasoning. Combined the deep learning technology to realize the semi-automatic construction of the knowledge graph, which was of great significance for the detection of crop diseases and insect pests, forecasting and early warning, and the establishment of prevention models in the intelligent production system. It could provide a high-quality knowledge base for crop diseases and insect pests question answering systems, recommendation systems, search engines, and other applications, which could be effectively applied to crop variety selection, pest prevention and control, and fertilization and irrigation.  2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Big data driven vehicle battery management method: A novel cyber-physical system perspective,NO,,,,"The establishment of an accurate battery model is of great significance to improve the reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However, the battery is a complex electrochemical system with hardly observable and simulatable internal chemical reactions, and it is challenging to estimate the state of battery accurately. This paper proposes a novel flexible and reliable battery management method based on the battery big data platform and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology. First of all, to integrate the battery big data resources in the cloud, a Cyber-physical battery management framework is defined and served as the basic data platform for battery modeling issues. And to improve the quality of the collected battery data in the database, this work reports the first attempt to develop an adaptive data cleaning method for the cloud battery management issue. Furthermore, a deep learning algorithm-based feature extraction model, as well as a feature-oriented battery modeling method, is developed to mitigate the under-fitting problem and improve the accuracy of the cloud-based battery model. The actual operation data of electric buses is used to validate the proposed methodologies. The maximum data restoring error can be limited within 1.3% in the experiments, which indicates that the proposed data cleaning method is able to improve the cloud battery data quality effectively. Meanwhile, the maximum SoC estimation error in the proposed feature-oriented battery modeling method is within 2.47%, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","Li, Shuangqi; Zhao, Pengfei",10.1016/j.est.2020.102064,journalArticle,Z2PFPAUD,2021,,1

Fast record linkage for company entities,Specific,,,,"Record linkage is an essential part of nearly all real-world systems that consume structured and unstructured data coming from different sources. Typically no common key is available for connecting records. Massive data cleaning and data integration processes often have to be completed before any data analytics and further processing can be performed. Although record linkage is frequently regarded as a somewhat tedious but necessary step, it reveals valuable insights into the data at hand. These insights guide further analytic approaches to the data and support data visualization. In this work we focus on company entity matching, where company name, location and industry are taken into account. Our contribution is an end-to-end, highly scalable, enterprise-grade system that uses rule-based linkage algorithms extended with a machine learning approach to account for short company names. Linkage time is greatly reduced by efficient decomposition of the search space using MinHash. High linkage accuracy is achieved by the proposed thorough scoring process of the matching candidates. Based on real-world ground truth datasets, we show that our approach reaches a recall of 91% compared to 73% for baseline approaches. These results are achieved while scaling linearly with the number of nodes used in the system. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

An unsupervised normalization algorithm for noisy text: A case study for information retrieval and stance detection,NO,,,,"A large fraction of textual data available today contains various types of noise, such as OCR noise in digitized documents, noise due to informal writing style of users on microblogging sites, and so on. To enable tasks such as search/retrieval and classification over all the available data, we need robust algorithms for text normalization, i.e., for cleaning different kinds of noise in the text. There have been several efforts towards cleaning or normalizing noisy text; however, many of the existing text normalization methods are supervised, and require language-dependent resources or large amounts of training data that is difficult to obtain. We propose an unsupervised algorithm for text normalization that does not need any training data / human intervention. The proposed algorithm is applicable to text over different languages, and can handle both machine-generated and human-generated noise. Experiments over several standard datasets show that text normalization through the proposed algorithm enables better retrieval and stance detection, as compared to that using several baseline text normalization methods. Implementation of our algorithm can be found at https://github.com/ranarag/UnsupClean. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Text classification to streamline online wildlife trade analyses,NO,,,,"Automated monitoring of websites that trade wildlife is increasingly necessary to inform conservation and biosecurity efforts. However, e-commerce and wildlife trading websites can contain a vast number of advertisements, an unknown proportion of which may be irrelevant to researchers and practitioners. Given that many wildlife-trade advertisements have an unstructured text format, automated identification of relevant listings has not traditionally been possible, nor attempted. Other scientific disciplines have solved similar problems using machine learning and natural language processing models, such as text classifiers. Here, we test the ability of a suite of text classifiers to extract relevant advertisements from wildlife trade occurring on the Internet. We collected data from an Australian classifieds website where people can post advertisements of their pet birds (n = 16.5k advertisements). We found that text classifiers can predict, with a high degree of accuracy, which listings are relevant (ROC AUC >= 0.98, F1 score >= 0.77). Furthermore, in an attempt to answer the question 'how much data is required to have an adequately performing model?', we conducted a sensitivity analysis by simulating decreases in sample sizes to measure the subsequent change in model performance. From our sensitivity analysis, we found that text classifiers required a minimum sample size of 33% (c. 5.5k listings) to accurately identify relevant listings (for our dataset), providing a reference point for future applications of this sort. Our results suggest that text classification is a viable tool that can be applied to the online trade of wildlife to reduce time dedicated to data cleaning. However, the success of text classifiers will vary depending on the advertisements and websites, and will therefore be context dependent. Further work to integrate other machine learning tools, such as image classification, may provide better predictive abilities in the context of streamlining data processing for wildlife trade related online data.","Stringham, OC; Moncayo, S; Hill, KGW; Toomes, A; Mitchell, L; Ross, JV; Cassey, P",10.1371/journal.pone.0254007,journalArticle,MY6DGJ8L,2021,,1

Efficient two-stage label noise reduction for retrieval-based tasks,NO,,,,"The existence of noisy labels in datasets has always been an essential dilemma in deep learning studies. Previous works detected noisy labels by analyzing the predicted probability distribution generated by the model trained on the same data and calculating the probabilities of each label to be regarded as noise. However, the predicted probability distribution from the whole dataset may introduce overfitting, and the overfitting on noisy labels may induce the probability distribution of clean and noisy items to be not conditional independent, making identification more challenging. Additionally, label noise reduction on image datasets has received much attention, while label noise reduction on text datasets has not. This paper proposes a noisy label reduction method for text datasets, which could be applied at retrieval-based tasks by getting a conditional independent probability distribution to identify noisy labels accurately. The method first generates a candidate set containing noisy labels, predicts the category probabilities by the model trained on the rest cleaner data, and then identifies noisy items by analyzing a confidence matrix. Moreover, we introduce a warm-up module and a sharpened cross-entropy loss function for efficiently training in the first stage. Empirical results on different rates of uniform and random label noise in five text datasets demonstrate that our method can improve the label noise reduction accuracy and end-to-end classification accuracy. Further, we find that the iteration of the label noise reduction method is efficient to high-rate label noise datasets, and our method will not hurt clean datasets too much.  2022 ACM.","Kuang, Mengmeng; Wang, Weiyan; Chen, Zhenhong; Kang, Lie; Yan, Qiang",10.1145/3488560.3498482,conferencePaper,PW7UYMTX,2022,,1

Evaluation of structural integrity of railway bridge using acceleration data and semi-supervised learning approach,NO,,,,"In order to investigate the structural integrity of a railway bridge, supervised and semi-supervised deep learning techniques incorporating wavelet transform (WT) were used where the measured acceleration data were transformed into images. Specifically, the structural integrity was evaluated both by acceleration datasets of a newly built bridge and by damaged datasets calculated from numerical analyses, and assumed damage in the structure was detected by supervised and semi-supervised learning methods. For the supervised learning, the well-known AlexNet and VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) models were employed, and during the one class (OC) classification of the semi-supervised learning approach, wherein only the label of the normal data was known a priori, a transfer learning method was utilized. It was found that the minimum value of damage with which novelty was detected was found to be at least 15% reduction of the stiffness in our case. It was also found that the cosine rather than Euclidean distance metric was more accurate during damage prediction. Although both methods showed very reliable prediction results, the semi-supervised learning method was shown to be more practical under the given field conditions.","Lee, Jun S.; Min Kim, Hyun; Il Kim, Sung; Min Lee, Hyun",10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.112330,journalArticle,IMBAFQUC,2021,,1

AutoRepair: an automatic repairing approach over multi-source data,NO,,,,"Truth discovery methods and rule-based data repairing methods are two classic lines of approaches to improve data quality in the field of database. Truth discovery methods resolve the multi-source conflicts for the same entity by estimating the reliabilities of different source, while rule-based data repairing methods resolve the inconsistencies among different entities using integrity constraints. However, both lines of methods suffer unsatisfactory performances due to the lacking of enough evidence. In this paper, we propose AutoRepair, a novel automatic multi-source data repairing approach to enrich the evidence by taking the advantages of truth discovery and data repairing. We use functional dependency, one of the most common types of constraints, to detect the violations, and use the source reliability as evidence to discover and repair the errors among these violations. At the same time, the repaired results are used to estimate the source reliability. As the source reliability is unknown in advance, we model the process as an iterative framework to ensure better performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets.

A case study is conducted with real consumption data from residential, commercial, and industrial consumers to show the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method for load profiling. After the data cleansing, filtering, and normalization processes, the input dataset is divided into several clusters based on their profile differences. Later, various results are obtained to reflect different consumption patterns within a profile group by the selected distance measurement methods such as Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping. The results obtained in the case study show that the proposed mathematical algorithm can be used to create realistic and scalable profiling subgroups (with percentages of similar consumptions in each cluster) instead of the traditional methods which cluster all profiles in a single big cluster.

Mitigating Class Imbalance for IoT Network Intrusion Detection: A Survey,NO,,,,"As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continues to rapidly increase, the need to effectively manage the related security risks has become more obvious. For this reason, datasets such as Bot-IoT were created to train machine learning models on network-based intrusion detection. Bot-IoT is modern, publicly available, and covers a wide range of botnet attack traffic in IoT networks. Out of the roughly 73,000,000 instances contained in this dataset, only about 0.013% represents normal traffic, which indicates that the issue of class imbalance should not be ignored for Bot-IoT. Our contribution includes several important findings based on works that address the imbalance in this dataset. In general, we noted the excellent performance of a diverse range of trained models. This suggests Bot-IoT is a reliable dataset that is relatively easy to classify. We also observed that information on data cleaning was left out in a few papers, thus making it challenging for outside researchers to reproduce experiments from these works. Finally, we noted the popularity of both data-level and algorithm-level approaches for mitigating class imbalance in Bot-IoT.  2021 IEEE.","Leevy, Joffrey L.; Khoshgoftaar, Taghi M.; Peterson, Jared M.",10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00023,conferencePaper,5CSIFH3Q,2021,,1

To this end, we propose a deep learning based framework for ER, which can leverage the state-of-the-art techniques in deep neural network communities. We also propose an importance-and-semantics-aware approach for ER using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), to combine the importance of overlapped tokens, semantic similarity and textual similarity of corresponding attribute values of pairs.

Method and analysis of train dynamic test trending abnormal data cleaning based on super smoother and 3 principles,NO,,,,"Train dynamic testing has the problems such as large data collection environment interference and high repetition cost. It is necessary to retain as much effective information as possible from abnormal data. Aiming at the long-period, low-frequency trending abnormal data cleaning problem, this article first introduces a data cleaning method based on Super smoother and 3 principles. Then, through comparing with other commonly used abnormal data cleaning methods such as neural network, wavelet transform, etc., the data cleaning ability of the method is analyzed and verified from four aspects: noise reduction processing, data drift processing, missing data supplementing processing and transient and rapid abnormal fluctuation processing. Analysis and verification results show that the Pearson coefficient of the data after cleaning is risen from 0.785 to 0.923. The method has great advantages in fast cleaning and data repair.

Intelligent text recognition based on multi-feature channels network for construction quality control,NO,,,,"Construction quality control is achieved primarily through various testing and inspections and subsequent analysis of the massive unstructured quality records. The quality professionals are required to classify and review the inspection texts according to the project category. However, manual processing of a sheer amount of textual data is not only time-consuming, laborious but also error-prone, which could lead to overlooked quality issues and harm the overall project performance. In response, this paper uses the text mining method to mine the hidden information from unstructured text records. First, obtain quality text records on-site, use data cleaning method to obtain 9859 clean data, then use both Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) pre-training and Word2vec methods to quantify the text into a digital representation, next improve the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by expanding input channels, and input the quantified text into the model to extract key features to realize the integration of quality records according to established categories. The results show that the average precision of the proposed model is 89.69%. Compared with CNN, BERT, and other models, this model has less manual intervention, less time-consuming training, and higher precision. Finally, through data augmentation of small sample data, the precision of the model is further improved, reaching 92.02%. The proposed model can assist quality professionals to quickly spot key quality issues and reference corresponding quality standards for further actions, and allow them to focus on more value-added efforts, e.g., making decisions and planning for corrective actions.

Unmasking the Masked Face Using Zero-Shot Learning,NO,,,,"Nowadays, people are required to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 is an ongoing crisis that has resulted in a large number of fatalities and safety concerns. People also carry masks to cover themselves to effectively prevent the transmission of this virus. In this situation recognizing a face is very challenging. In certain cases, like facial attendance, face access control, facial security, this makes traditional facial recognition technology ineffective, for that urgent requirement to improve this recognition performance and use the technology on the masked face. During the current pandemic, the main objective of researchers is to deal with these problems through quick and accurate approaches. Throughout this report, suggest a clear way centred on removing masked areas and deep learning related techniques to resolve the issues of mask detection. Another way of finding the masked face is to go through TensorFlow, YOLOv5, SSDMNV2, SVM, OpenCV, Keras. Deep Learning of artificial intelligence (AI) is an exciting future technology with explosive growth.

A Hybrid System for Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Analysis via Supervised Learning,NO,,,,"Telecom industry relies on churn prediction models to retain their customers. These prediction models help in precise and right time recognition of future switching by a group of customers to other service providers. Retention not only contributes to the profit of an organization, but it is also important for upholding a position in the competitive market. In the past, numerous churn prediction models have been proposed, but the current models have a number of flaws that prevent them from being used in real-world large-scale telecom datasets. These schemes, fail to incorporate frequently changing requirements. Data sparsity, noisy data, and the imbalanced nature of the dataset are the other main challenges for an accurate prediction. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model, name as ""A Hybrid System for Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Analysis via Supervised Learning (HCPRs)"" that used Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the issue of imbalance class data and feature selection. Data cleaning and normalization has been done on big Orange dataset contains 15000 features along with 50000 entities.

Iterative Training of Neural Networks for Intra Prediction,NO,,,,"This paper presents an iterative training of neural networks for intra prediction in a block-based image and video codec. First, the neural networks are trained on blocks arising from the codec partitioning of images, each paired with its context. Then, iteratively, blocks are collected from the partitioning of images via the codec including the neural networks trained at the previous iteration, each paired with its context, and the neural networks are retrained on the new pairs. Thanks to this training, the neural networks can learn intra prediction functions that both stand out from those already in the initial codec and boost the codec in terms of rate-distortion. Moreover, the iterative process allows the design of training data cleansings essential for the neural network training. When the iteratively trained neural networks are put into H.265 (HM-16.15), -4.2% of mean BD-rate reduction is obtained, i.e. -1.8% above the state-of-the-art. By moving them into H.266 (VTM-5.0), the mean BD-rate reduction reaches -1.9%.","Dumas, T.; Galpin, F.; Bordes, P.",10.1109/TIP.2020.3038348,journalArticle,NKWGC3SV,2021,,1

An Application of Ensemble and Deep Learning Models in Predictive Analytics,NO,,,,"Predictive analytics stands for prediction of future demand with the help of historical data. An accurate prediction of future demand is the need for a competitive and challenging market. Thus a robust and accurate model is required to cater to such needs. This paper proposes two novel approaches for taxi demand prediction that is about to come in the next ten-minutes interval. The first model is a three-stage ensemble model for prediction where the first stage consists of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) and then Mini-Batch K-Means clustering is applied, followed by time-binning in the second stage and in the final stage the processed data is fed to the Ensemble Model. The second model is a four-stage deep learning model where the first two stages are common as the proposed ensemble model. In the third stage, the Fourier Transform of the time series data is used to extract and add more features to the training set and in the final stage, the processed training set is fed to the deep neural network (DNN) for prediction. The NYC TLC trip dataset is used for the experiments, and the results clearly indicate that the proposed models perform better than the existing models and the deep learning model performs the best among all.  2020 IEEE.","Sonbhadra, Sanjay Kumar; Agarwal, Sonali; Syafrullah, Mohammad; Adiyarta, Krisna",10.1109/ICIEA49774.2020.9102115,conferencePaper,XF7D7M6Q,2020,,1

Low rank representation and discriminant analysis-based models for peer-to-peer default risk assessment,NO,,,,"Purpose: This study aims to assess the default risk of borrowers in peer-to-peer (P2P) online lending platforms. The authors propose a novel default risk classification model based on data cleaning and feature extraction, which increases risk assessment accuracy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use borrower data from the Lending Club and propose the risk assessment model based on low-rank representation (LRR) and discriminant analysis. Firstly, the authors use three LRR models to clean the high-dimensional borrower data by removing outliers and noise, and then the authors adopt a discriminant analysis algorithm to reduce the dimension of the cleaned data. In the dimension-reduced feature space, machine learning classifiers including the k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and artificial neural network are used to assess and classify default risks. Findings: The results reveal significant noise and redundancy in the borrower data. LRR models can effectively clean such data, particularly the two LRR models with local manifold regularisation. In addition, the supervised discriminant analysis model, termed the local Fisher discriminant analysis model, can extract low-dimensional and discriminative features, which further increases the accuracy of the final risk assessment models. Originality/value: The originality of this study is that it proposes a novel default risk assessment model, based on data cleaning and feature extraction, for P2P online lending platforms. The proposed approach is innovative and efficient in the P2P online lending field.  2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Yuan, Gui; Huang, Shali; Fu, Jing; Jiang, Xinwei",10.1108/JSIT-03-2020-0040,journalArticle,H8L5NTWW,2022,,1

Efficient Prediction of Missed Clinical Appointment Using Machine Learning,NO,,,,"Public health and its related facilities are crucial for thriving cities and societies. The optimum utilization of health resources saves money and time, but above all, it saves precious lives. It has become even more evident in the present as the pandemic has overstretched the existing medical resources. Specific to patient appointment scheduling, the casual attitude of missing medical appointments (no-show-ups) may cause severe damage to a patient's health. In this paper, with the help of machine learning, we analyze six million plus patient appointment records to predict a patient's behaviors/characteristics by using ten different machine learning algorithms. For this purpose, we first extracted meaningful features from raw data using data cleaning. We applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method (Adasyn), and random undersampling (RUS) to balance our data. After balancing, we applied ten different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest classifier, decision tree, logistic regression, XG Boost, gradient boosting, Adaboost Classifier, Naive Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, multilayer perceptron, and Support Vector Machine. We analyzed these results with the help of six different metrics, i.e., recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, area under the curve, and mean square error. Our study has achieved 94% recall, 86% accuracy, 83% precision, 87% F1-score, 92% area under the curve, and 0.106 minimum mean square error. Effectiveness of presented data cleaning and feature selection is confirmed by better results in all training algorithms. Notably, recall is greater than 75%, accuracy is greater than 73%, F1-score is more significant than 75%, MSE is lesser than 0.26, and AUC is greater than 74%. The research shows that instead of individual features, combining different features helps make better predictions of a patient's appointment status.  2021 Zeeshan Qureshi et al.","Qureshi, Zeeshan; Maqbool, Ayesha; Mirza, Alina; Iqbal, Muhammad Zubair; Afzal, Farkhanda; Kanubala, Deborah Dormah; Rana, Tauseef; Umair, Mir Yasir; Wakeel, Abdul; Shah, Said Khalid",10.1155/2021/2376391,journalArticle,M5WLX3SS,2021,,1

Polly: A Tool for Rapid Data Integration and Analysis in Support of Agricultural Research and Education,NO,,,,"Data analysis and modeling is a complex and demanding task. While a variety of software and tools exist to cope with this problem and tame big data operations, most of these tools are either not free, and when they are, they require large amount of configuration and steep learning curve. Moreover, they provide limited functionalities. In this paper we propose Polly, an online data analysis and modeling open-source tool that is intuitive to use and can be used with minimal or no configuration. Users can use Polly to rapidly integrate, analyze their data, prototype and test their novel methodologies. Polly can be used also as an educational tool. Users can use Polly to upload or connect to their structured data sources, load the required data into our system and perform various data processing tasks. Examples of such operations include data cleaning, data pre-processing, attribute encoding, regression and classification analysis. Aside from modeling, users can then download their results in the form of graphs in several standard visualization formats. While in this paper we focus on analyzing dataset for smart farming, our tool usage fits to a more general audience. To justify our backend design and implementation choices, we also present a performance analysis between backend virtualization technologies (containers or serverless computing), showing both expected and surprising results.","Muhammad, Waqar; Esposito, Flavio; Maimaitijiang, Maitiniyazi; Sagan, Vasit; Bonaiuti, Enrico",10.1016/j.iot.2019.100141,journalArticle,PUFUYWZ5,2020,,1

Fake Feedback Detection to Enhance Trust in Cloud Using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques,NO,,,,"Lots of enterprises have commenced to move toward a cloud-based infrastructure for their services. Organizations of distinct types, sizes, and industry are adopting cloud services for a broad range of use cases, such as software development, product deployment, backup of data, email services, and numerous tasks. Although there are various advantages of using cloud computing as the ability to scale rapidly, store data remotely, reducing the overall cost. Cloud computing has some major trust concerns due to privacy issues such as lack of transparency, lack of user control over users data. Thus, lack of trust is a big issue for cloud service providers and cloud infrastructure users. This paper centers on how to achieve a trust management system around cloud services by finding fake feedbacks on CloudArmours Trust Feedback Dataset. Post preprocessing and data cleaning, multiple models like Support vector machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree were trained on our dataset to find the most accurate model. An ensemble model has also been proposed which has proved to be best algorithm for identifying fake feedbacks and has shown accuracy, precision & recall value of 93.55%, 92.90%, and 92.82%, respectively. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Taneja, Harsh; Kaur, Supreet",,bookSection,H8S27IM3,2022,,1

Making Memristive Neural Network Accelerators Reliable,NO,,,,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted substantial interest in recent years due to their superior performance on many classification and regression tasks as compared to other supervised learning models. DNNs often require a large amount of data movement, resulting in performance and energy overheads. One promising way to address this problem is to design an accelerator based on in-situ analog computing that leverages the fundamental electrical properties of memristive circuits to perform matrix-vector multiplication. Recent work on analog neural network accelerators has shown great potential in improving both the system performance and the energy efficiency. However, detecting and correcting the errors that occur during in-memory analog computation remains largely unexplored. The same electrical properties that provide the performance and energy improvements make these systems especially susceptible to errors, which can severely hurt the accuracy of the neural network accelerators. This paper examines a new error correction scheme for analog neural network accelerators based on arithmetic codes. The proposed scheme encodes the data through multiplication by an integer, which preserves addition operations through the distributive property. Error detection and correction are performed through a modulus operation and a correction table lookup. This basic scheme is further improved by data-aware encoding to exploit the state dependence of the errors, and by knowledge of how critical each portion of the computation is to overall system accuracy. By leveraging the observation that a physical row that contains fewer 1s is less susceptible to an error, the proposed scheme increases the effective error correction capability with less than 4.5% area and less than 4.7% energy overheads. When applied to a memristive DNN accelerator performing inference on the MNIST and ILSVRC-2012 datasets, the proposed technique reduces the respective misclassification rates by 1.5x and 1.1x.  2018 IEEE.","Feinberg, Ben; Wang, Shibo; Ipek, Engin",10.1109/HPCA.2018.00015,conferencePaper,UC29MT4A,2018,,1

Network Intrusion Detection Method Combining CNN and BiLSTM in Cloud Computing Environment,NO,,,,"A network intrusion detection method combining CNN and BiLSTM network is proposed. First, the KDD CUP 99 data set is preprocessed by using data extraction algorithm. The data set is transformed into image data set by data cleaning, data extraction, and data mapping; Second, CNN is used to extract the parallel local features of attribute information, and BiLSTM is used to extract the features of long-distance-dependent information, so as to fully consider the influence between the front and back attribute information, and attention mechanism is introduced to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, C5.0 decision tree and CNN BiLSTM deep learning model are combined to skip the design feature selection and directly use deep learning model to learn the representational features of high-dimensional data. Experimental results show that, compared with the methods based on AE-AlexNet and SGM-CNN, the network intrusion detection effect of this method is better, the average accuracy can be improved to 95.50%, the false-positive rate can be reduced to 4.24%, and the false positive rate can be reduced to 6.66%.

Developing an Intelligent System with Deep Learning Algorithms for Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Product Reviews,NO,,,,"Most consumers rely on online reviews when deciding to purchase e-commerce services or products. Unfortunately, the main problem of these reviews, which is not completely tackled, is the existence of deceptive reviews. The novelty of the proposed system is the application of opinion mining on consumers' reviews to help businesses and organizations continually improve their market strategies and obtain an in-depth analysis of the consumers' opinions regarding their products and brands. In this paper, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and deep learning convolutional neural network integrated with LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models were used for sentiment analysis of reviews in the e-commerce domain. The system was tested and evaluated by using real-time data that included reviews of cameras, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, televisions, and video surveillance products from the Amazon website. Data preprocessing steps, such as lowercase processing, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and tokenization, were used for data cleaning. The clean data were processed with the LSTM and CNN-LSTM models for the detection and classification of the consumers' sentiment into positive or negative. The LSTM and CNN-LSTM algorithms achieved an accuracy of 94% and 91%, respectively. We conclude that the deep learning techniques applied here provide optimal results for the classification of the customers' sentiment toward the products.  2022 Mohammad Eid Alzahrani et al.","Alzahrani, Mohammad Eid; Aldhyani, Theyazn H.

Learning from Time-Synchronized Power System Measurements with Rare Anomalous Event Records to Detect PMU Data Manipulation Attacks,NO,,,,"PMU data manipulation attacks (DMA) which maliciously modify the synchrophasor measurements in power systems, is an emerging type of cyber-attack aiming to mislead the control center into taking erroneous control actions. Widespread application of PMU produces a vast amount of time-synchronized historical operating data, making it possible to turn to machine learning approaches to detect the attacks. However, anomalous events occur rarely in practice. To construct a balanced training dataset, where normal and anomalous instances need to be evenly extracted and labeled from historical operating records, is sure to cost plenty of human efforts and may introduce uncontrollable experience errors. In this paper, we design a novel detection model with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) based data augmentation and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)based data cleaning technique to reconstruct the imbalanced training dataset into a balanced one to train the subsequent XGBoost classifier. Experiments show that although rare anomalous historical event records are needed, our model is still able to effectively detect out DMAs in power systems.","Wang, JY; Shi, DY; IEEE",,conferencePaper,U5VCR27H,2017,,1

Information fusion for automated post-disaster building damage evaluation using deep neural network,NO,,,,"This paper develops a hybrid neural network architecture named multi-class factorization machine with deep neural network (multi-FMDNN) to fuse multi-source information for the automatic post-earthquake building damage evaluation. The novel algorithm is a combination of the factorization machine (FM) and the deep neural network (DNN), which adopts the one-vs-all strategy to fuse results from multiple base classifiers. 39,352 buildings affected by the 2015 Nepal earthquake are taken as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-FMDNN. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model outperforms over many other popular machine learning methods due to the powerful feature learning ability, ultimately reaching an overall accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score in the value of 0.703, 0.737, and 0.702, respectively. Features associated with building structural characteristics are found to contribute more to classifying damage grades precisely. Besides, data preprocessing for data cleaning, encoding, and transformation is a necessary step to bring additional performance enhancement. For significance in the knowledge aspect, a novel multi-FMDNN algorithm is developed, which is superior in extracting both low- and high-order feature representation automatically from large volumes of destroyed buildings-related data and learning the optimal feature interactions simultaneously to pursue more accurate classification. For significance in the application aspect, the predicted results provide deep insights into a better understanding of the building vulnerability in seismic areas and inform data-driven decisions in disaster relief efforts. A promising future scope is to make full use of the available pre-event data along with some post-event data, which is possible to return fairly promising predictions and reduce the burden in earthquake field investigations for rapid responses. In future work, advanced techniques associated with data augment, hyperparameter optimization, and others will be implemented to constantly improve the overall accuracy and generalizability of the prediction model.  2021 Elsevier Ltd","Zhang, Limao; Pan, Yue",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103574,journalArticle,I24GAPUM,2022,,1

Federated Data Cleaning: Collaborative and Privacy-Preserving Data Cleaning for Edge Intelligence,not sure,,,,"As an important driving factor of emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, machine learning algorithms are currently facing the challenge of how to 'clean' data noise, that is introduced during the training process (e.g., asynchronous execution and lossy data compression and quantization). In an attempt to guarantee data quality, various data cleaning approaches have been proposed to filter out abnormal data entries based on the global data distribution. However, most existing data cleaning approaches are based on a centralized paradigm and thus cannot be applied to future edge-based IoT applications, where each edge node (EN) has only a limited view of the global data distribution. Moreover, the increasing demand for privacy preservation largely prevents ENs from combining their data for centralized cleaning. In this study, we propose a federated data cleaning protocol, coined as FedClean, for edge intelligence (EI) scenarios that is designed to achieve data cleaning without compromising data privacy. More specifically, different ENs first generate Boolean shares of their data and distribute them to two noncolluding servers. These two servers then run the FedClean protocol to privately and efficiently compute the attribute value frequency (AVF) scores of the collected data entries, which are then sorted in ascending order via a bitonic sorting network without revealing their values. As a result, data entries with lower AVF scores are considered as abnormal and filtered out. The security, efficiency, and effectiveness of the proposed approach are then demonstrated via concrete security analysis and comprehensive experiments.  2014 IEEE.","Ma, Lichuan; Pei, Qingqi; Zhou, Lu; Zhu, Haojin; Wang, Licheng; Ji, Yusheng",10.1109/JIOT.2020.3027980,journalArticle,PZBEUPRC,2021,,1

AlphaClean: Automatic Generation of Data Cleaning Pipelines,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,features,"The analyst effort in data cleaning is gradually shifting away from the design of hand-written scripts to building and tuning complex pipelines of automated data cleaning libraries. Hyperparameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyperparmeter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.

Malicious Mining Behavior Detection System of Encrypted Digital Currency Based on Machine Learning,NO,,,,"With the gradual increase of malicious mining, a large amount of computing resources are wasted, and precious power resources are consumed maliciously. Many detection methods to detect malicious mining behavior have been proposed by scholars, but most of which have pure defects and need to collect sensitive data (such as memory and register data) from the detected host. In order to solve these problems, a malicious mining detection system based on network timing signals is proposed. When capturing network traffic, the system does not need to know the contents of data packets but only collects network flow timing signals, which greatly protects the privacy of users. Besides, we use the campus network to carry out experiments, collect a large amount of network traffic data generated by mining behavior, and carry out feature extraction and data cleaning. We also collect traffic data of normal network behavior and combine them after labeling. Then, we use four machine learning algorithms for classification. The final results show that our detection system can effectively distinguish the normal network traffic and the network traffic generated by mining behavior.  2021 Mu Bie and Haoyu Ma.","Bie, Mu; Ma, Haoyu",10.1155/2021/2983605,journalArticle,BQHMKV9P,2021,,1

Artefact detection and quality assessment of ambulatory ECG signals,NO,,,,"Background and Objectives The presence of noise sources could reduce the diagnostic capability of the ECG signal and result in inappropriate treatment decisions. To mitigate this problem, automated algorithms to detect artefacts and quantify the quality of the recorded signal are needed. In this study we present an automated method for the detection of artefacts and quantification of the signal quality. The suggested methodology extracts descriptive features from the autocorrelation function and feeds these to a RUSBoost classifier. The posterior probability of the clean class is used to create a continuous signal quality assessment index. Firstly, the robustness of the proposed algorithm is investigated and secondly, the novel signal quality assessment index is evaluated. Methods Data were used from three different studies: a Sleep study, the PhysioNet 2017 Challenge and a Stress study. Binary labels, clean or contaminated, were available from different annotators with experience in ECG analysis. Two types of realistic ECG noise from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB) were added to the Sleep study to test the quality index. Firstly, the model was trained on the Sleep dataset and subsequently tested on a subset of the other two datasets. Secondly, all recording conditions were taken into account by training the model on a subset derived from the three datasets. Lastly, the posterior probabilities of the model for the different levels of agreement between the annotators were compared. Results AUC values between 0.988 and 1.000 were obtained when training the model on the Sleep dataset. These results were further improved when training on the three datasets and thus taking all recording conditions into account. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8131 was observed between the score of the clean class and the level of agreement. Additionally, significant quality decreases per noise level for both types of added noise were observed. Conclusions The main novelty of this study is the new approach to ECG signal quality assessment based on the posterior clean class probability of the classifier.","Moeyersons, Jonathan; Smets, Elena; Morales, John; Villa, Amalia; De Raedt, Walter; Testelmans, Dries; Buyse, Bertien; Van Hoof, Chris; Willems, Rik; Van Huffel, Sabine; Varon, Carolina",10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105050,journalArticle,ZK48M3IF,2019,,1

Sleep-Wake Classification for Home Monitoring of Sleep Apnea Patients,NO,,,,"Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder, whose diagnosis can strongly benefit from home-based screening. As the total sleep time is essential to assess the sleep apnea severity, a sleep-wake classifier was developed based on heart rate and respiration. These two signals were selected as they can be measured using unobtrusive sensors. A 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to classify 30s epochs of tachograms and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) signals. The input based on beat-to-beat variability allows the use of different sensor types. A dataset of 56 patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) below 10 was used to train and validate the network. This CNN was applied to an independent test set of ECG and RIP signals of 25 subjects. Of these, 8 subjects were simultaneously monitored using an unobtrusive capacitive-coupled ECG (ccECG) sensor integrated in a mattress. Artefact removal and data correction was performed on this acquired data. The performance on the independent dataset of ECG and RIP is comparable to state-of-the-art, with ? = 0.48. However, application on the ccECG data resulted in a drop in performance, with ? = 0.30. This was caused by a low amount of remaining wake epochs after data cleaning. Importantly, the network classified 30s segments of sleep apnea patients, without relying on past or future information for feature extraction.  2020 Creative Commons; the authors hold their copyright.","Huysmans, Dorien; Heffinck, Eva; Castro, Ivan D; Deviaene, Margot; Borzee, Pascal; Buyse, Bertien; Testelmans, Dries; Van Huffel, Sabine; Varon, Carolina",10.22489/CinC.2020.147,conferencePaper,34RZNKWY,2020,,1

Obtaining Dyadic Fairness by Optimal Transport,NO,,,,"Fairness has been taken as a critical metric on machine learning models. Many works studying how to obtain fairness for different tasks emerge. This paper considers obtaining fairness for link prediction tasks, which can be measured by dyadic fairness. We aim to propose a pre-processing methodology to obtain dyadic fairness through data repairing and optimal transport. To obtain dyadic fairness with satisfying flexibility and unambiguity requirements, we transform the dyadic repairing to the conditional distribution alignment problem based on optimal transport and obtain theoretical results on the connection between the proposed alignment and dyadic fairness. The optimal transport-based dyadic fairness algorithm is proposed for graph link prediction. Our proposed algorithm shows superior results on obtaining fairness compared with the other pre-processing methods on two benchmark graph datasets. Copyright  2022, The Authors.

Model and Optimize the Magnetic Composite Fluid (MCF) Polishing Process with Machine Learning Modeling and Intelligent Optimization Algorithm,NO,,,,"In the magnetic composite fluid (MCF) polishing process, appropriate polishing parameters are the basis of achieving high-quality polishing without damage. Appropriate polishing parameters are mainly based on an accurate polishing model and an excellent polishing parameters optimization algorithm. However, due to the complicated principle of MCF polishing and various influencing elements, traditional modeling methods have the limitations of low accuracy, poor application, and difficulty in correcting. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain the optimal polishing quality by optimizing the polishing parameters based on the traditional model. This study proposed an online modeling approach considering data cleaning based on machine learning modeling, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize polishing parameters. Then, copper polishing experiments were carried out to validate the modeling and optimization methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning online modeling method can establish an accurate MCF polishing model, and the nano-scale fine polishing of copper can be achieved by the optimized polishing parameters of PSO, and the surface roughness of the copper sample was reduced by 85% to 0.031m.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Fan, Jinwei; Ren, Xingfei; Pan, Ri; Wang, Peitong; Tao, Haohao",10.1007/s12541-022-00668-5,journalArticle,4N7X95U8,2022,,1

The Prediction of Quality of the Air Using Supervised Learning,NO,,,,"In general, Pollution of the climate refers to the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere that damage human health and the environment as a whole. It has the ability to be one of the most dangerous things humans have ever experienced. It damages livestock, crops, and forests, among other things. To avoid this issue in mostly urban areas, the popular approach such as machine learning techniques may be used to predict air quality from contaminants. As a consequence, the quality of the air assessment and forecasting has become an important field of study. The goal is to develop machine learning-based air quality forecasting techniques that are as accurate as possible. The supervised machine learning technique (SMLT) will be used to gather several pieces of information from the dataset, including variable recognition, uni-variate analysis, bi-variate and multi-variate analysis, missing value treatment and analysis, data cleaning/preparation, and data representation. Our findings provide a valuable guide to sensitivity analysis of model parameters in terms of success in air quality pollution prediction through accuracy measurement. By comparing supervise classification machine learning algorithms and generating prediction results in the form of best accuracy, create a machine learning-based method for accurately predicting the Air Quality Index value. Furthermore, to compare and discuss various machine learning algorithms in order to determine the most accurate algorithm with the performance of a GUI-based user interface for air quality prediction. Motivation: The aim is to create a machine learning model for realtime air quality forecasting that can potentially replace updatable supervised machine learning classification models by predicting best accuracy by comparing supervised algorithms. The aim of this project is to use machine learning to investigate a dataset of air pollutants records for the Indian meteorological sector. It is more difficult to determine air quality. This research work attempts to reduce the risk factor associated with forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) of India to a safe human level in order to save a significant amount of meteorological time and resources, as well as to predict whether the air quality is bad or good.  2021 IEEE.","Chakradhar Reddy, K.; Nagarjuna Reddy, K.; Brahmaji Prasad, K.; Rajendran, P.

A Hybrid Clinical Data Predication Approach Using Modified PSO,NO,,,,"Enhancement of diagnostic predictive mechanisms in Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) is performed through improving disease staging predictions, illness progression prediction, and reducing the number of features in high dimensional clinical data sets. All the works in this paper uses benchmark datasets from University of California Irvine machine learning repository for verification. Clinical datasets are obtained through various diagnostics procedures, and the data from different sources was transformed into a single format before the start of the analysis. Since there are many diagnostics procedures, the transformed data usually has a large number of features. Preliminary data cleaning procedures like duplicate removal, noise dismissal, and filling up of missing data are performed initially. Data reduction techniques are applied over this cleaned data. A dataset is mainly due to two main reasons: too many instances or too many attributes. Once the noisy and duplicate instances are removed, having too many instances usually generates an accurate classifier. However, having too many features is a negative aspect of data analytics because the dataset's unimportant features tend to bring down the classifier's accuracy that has produced using the dataset. Reducing the number of features to an optimal level to enhance the classifier's accuracy is the aim of feature reduction algorithms. Every disease has various stages of severity.

A Model and System for Querying Provenance from Data Cleaning Workflows,YES,DC4ML,?,features,"Data cleaning is an essential component of data preparation in machine learning and other data science workflows, and is widely recognized as the most time-consuming and error-prone part when working with real-world data. How data was prepared and cleaned has a significant impact on the reliability and trustworthiness of results of any subsequent analysis. Transparent data cleaning not only requires that provenance (i.e., operation history and value changes) be captured, but also that those changes are easy to explore and evaluate: The data scientists who prepare the data, as well as others who want to reuse the cleaned data for their studies, need to be able to easily explore and query its data cleaning history. We have developed a domain-specific provenance model for data cleaning that supports the kind of provenance questions that data scientists need to answer when inspecting and debugging data preparation histories. The design of the model was driven by the need (i) to answer relevant, user-oriented provenance questions, and (ii) to do so in an effective and efficient manner. The model is a refinement of an earlier provenance model and has been implemented as a companion tool to OpenRefine, a popular, open source tool for data cleaning.  2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Parulian, Nikolaus Nova; McPhillips, Timothy M.; Ludascher, Bertram",10.1007/978-3-030-80960-7_11,conferencePaper,IHXAR7EV,2021,aug,1

RPT: Relational pre-trained transformer is almost all you need towards democratizing data preparation,NO,,,,"Can AI help automate human-easy but computer-hard data preparation tasks that burden data scientists, practitioners, and crowd workers?We answer this question by presenting RPT, a denoising autoencoder for tuple-to-X models (""x"" could be tuple, token, label, JSON, and so on). RPT is pre-trained for a tuple-to-tuple model by corrupting the input tuple and then learning a model to reconstruct the original tuple. It adopts a Transformer-based neural translation architecture that consists of a bidirectional encoder (similar to BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (similar to GPT), leading to a generalization of both BERT and GPT. The pre-trained RPT can already support several common data preparation tasks such as data cleaning, auto-completion and schema matching. Better still, RPT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of data preparation tasks, such as value normalization, data transformation, data annotation, etc. To complement RPT, we also discuss several appealing techniques such as collaborative training and few-shot learning for entity resolution, and few-shot learning and NLP question-answering for information extraction. In addition, we identify a series of research opportunities to advance the field of data preparation. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Robust and automatic data cleansing method for short-term load forecasting of distribution feeders,Specific,,,,"Distribution networks are undergoing fundamental changes at medium voltage level. To support growing planning and control decision-making, the need for large numbers of short-term load forecasts has emerged. Data-driven modelling of medium voltage feeders can be affected by (1) data quality issues, namely, large gross errors and missing observations (2) the presence of structural breaks in the data due to occasional network reconfiguration and load transfers. The present work investigates and reports on the effects of advanced data cleansing techniques on forecast accuracy. A hybrid framework to detect and remove outliers in large datasets is proposed; this automatic procedure combines the Tukey labelling rule and the binary segmentation algorithm to cleanse data more efficiently, it is fast and easy to implement. Various approaches for missing value imputation are investigated, including unconditional mean, Hot Deck via k-nearest neighbour and Kalman smoothing. A combination of the automatic detection/removal of outliers and the imputation methods mentioned above are implemented to cleanse time series of 342 medium-voltage feeders. A nested rolling-origin-validation technique is used to evaluate the feed-forward deep neural network models. The proposed data cleansing framework efficiently removes outliers from the data, and the accuracy of forecasts is improved. It is found that Hot Deck (k-NN) imputation performs best in balancing the bias-variance trade-off for short-term forecasting.  2019","Huyghues-Beaufond, Nathalie; Tindemans, Simon; Falugi, Paola; Sun, Mingyang; Strbac, Goran",10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114405,journalArticle,WST5GQRC,2020,,1

"Data Cleaning for Accurate, Fair, and Robust Models: A Big Data - AI Integration Approach [arXiv]",YES,DC4ML,?,features,"The wide use of machine learning is fundamentally changing the software development paradigm (a.k.a. Software 2.0) where data becomes a first-class citizen, on par with code. As machine learning is used in sensitive applications, it becomes imperative that the trained model is accurate, fair, and robust to attacks. While many techniques have been proposed to improve the model training process (in-processing approach) or the trained model itself (post-processing), we argue that the most effective method is to clean the root cause of error: the data the model is trained on (pre-processing). Historically, there are at least three research communities that have been separately studying this problem: data management, machine learning (model fairness), and security. Although a significant amount of research has been done by each community, ultimately the same datasets must be preprocessed, and there is little understanding how the techniques relate to each other and can possibly be integrated. We contend that it is time to extend the notion of data cleaning for modern machine learning needs. We identify dependencies among the data preprocessing techniques and propose MLClean, a unified data cleaning framework that integrates the techniques and helps train accurate and fair models.

Application of attribute correlation in unsupervised data cleaning,YES,ML4DC,?,features,"Referring to the supervised learning and unsupervised learning in machine learning, we divide the data cleaning processes into supervised and unsupervised two forms too, and then, we reclassify the data quality problems into canonicalization error, redundancy error, strong logic error and weak logic error according to the characteristics of unsupervised cleaning. For the weak logic errors, we propose a repair framework AC-Framework and an algorithm AC-Repair based on the attribute correlation. When repairing, we first establish a priority queue(PQ) for elements to be repaired according to the minimum cost idea and take the corresponding conflict-free data set() as a training set to learn the correlation among attributes. Then, we select the first element in PQ list as the candidate element to repair, and recompute the PQ list after one repair round to improve the efficiency. Finally, in order to prevent the algorithm from endless loops, we set a label flag to mark the repaired elements, in this way, every error element will be repaired at most once. In the experimental part, we compare the AC-Repair algorithm with the interpolation-based repair algorithm to verify its validity.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Li, Pei; Dai, Chaofan; Wang, Wenqian",10.1145/3312714.3312717,conferencePaper,A9SYXK2D,2019,aug,1

The Method and Performance Analysis of Constructing Visual Point Cloud Map to Assist Inertial Positioning,NO,,,,"In the face of discontinuous GNSS signal and INS error accumulation in complex urban environment, the research on multi-source information fusion positioning method assisted by high-precision map is essential. In order to meet the real-time, continuous and reliable positioning requirements of vehicle navigation, this paper presents the principle and method of constructing high-precision map with stereo vision, and introduces the key technologies of map generation and data cleaning. Meanwhile, it analyzes the performance of the map-aided visual-inertial fusion positioning method. Firstly, the visual point cloud map is constructed based on mobile surveying. The local coordinates of road marking points are obtained by the front intersection of common-view pictures, then the camera pose solved from GNSS/SINS converted road marking points from local coordinate system to ECEF. However, the quantity of road marking points is large, and the absolute precision is difficult to evaluate. Therefore, this paper gives the quality indexes of evaluating point cloud map precision and data cleaning method. By using the method of deep learning to target recognition and semantic segmentation, only the long-term static stable road markings can be maintained in the map. In the meantime, a visual positioning method based on Octomap and DBOW acceleration is proposed. The KITTI dataset test shows that point cloud map is constructed and an average data cleaning rate is 35.05%, that many error observations are excluded. When it comes to positioning, the accuracy of visual/GNSS/INS integrated positioning yields about 2cm and 0.06. When integrated with INS, a positioning accuracy of 10cm can be maintained with only one road landmark matched successfully in the case of GNSS long time (20min) unlock.  2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Wang, Yayi; Zhu, Feng; Shen, Yanfen; Zhang, Xiaohong",10.1007/978-981-15-3715-8_45,conferencePaper,V57VH4M3,2020,,1

Quantitative experiments and user studies are conducted on an extensive dataset from a supply chain integration service group company. The results show that proposed approach is more effective on complex data deduplication problems than mainstream data cleaning software, such as Trifacta Wrangler and OpenRefine, while achieving more than twice their efficiency and having significant superiority in learning cost and usability.  2022, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

Feature dynamic deep learning approach for DDoS mitigation within the ISP domain,NO,,,,"The emergence of the Mirai malware facilitated a DDoS attack vector to surge to almost 1 Tbps in 2016, instigated by less than 150,000 infected IoT devices. With the infection of five new IoT devices per minute, the size of Mirai botnet was enlarged to 2.5 millions devices by the end of 2016. The continuous adaptation of the Mirai malware enables the modern variant to dynamically update its malware scripts on the fly to launch even more advanced and malevolent DDoS attacks, which dramatically escalates the level of difficulty with mitigating DDoS attacks. Many researchers endeavour to develop mitigation systems to keep up with the increasing security threats. Nonetheless, most presented models provide inefficient solutions either by utilising auxiliary servers at the host site, on the cloud or at dedicated data scrubbing centres. Since internet service providers (ISPs) connect the internet with users, the mitigation system should be deployed within the ISP domain to deliver a more efficient solution. Accordingly, we propose a stacked self-organising map, which is a feature dynamic deep learning approach that utilises netflow data collected by the ISP to combat the dynamic nature of novel DDoS attacks.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ko, Ili; Chambers, Desmond; Barrett, Enda",10.1007/s10207-019-00453-y,journalArticle,MD7RFNUH,2020,,1

The second issue has been handled developing and comparing an empirical model with a machine learning (ML)-based model; the comparison has been performed assessing capabilities thereof in predicting erroneous label cuts on data obtained from an operating plant located in Italy. Findings Research results showed that both empirical and ML-based approaches exhibit good performances in detecting the operating conditions of the cutting machine. The advantage of adopting an ML-based model is that it can be used not only as a condition indicator (i.e. a model able to continuously provide the health status of an asset) but also in predictive maintenance policies (i.e. a CBM carried out following a forecast of the degradation of the item). Research limitations/implications The study described in this manuscript has been developed on the practices of a labeling machine developed by an international company manufacturing bottling lines for beverage industry. The proposed approach might need some customization in case it is applied to other industries. Future researches can validate the applicability of such models on different rotary machines in other companies and similar industries. Originality/value The main contribution of this paper lies in the empirical demonstration of the benefits of CBM and predictive maintenance in manufacturing, through the overcoming of a specific production issue. The large number of variables involved in thin label cutting lines (film thickness between 30 and 38 mu m), the high throughput and the high costs due to production interruptions render the prediction of non-conforming labels an economically relevant, albeit challenging, goal. Moreover, despite the large scientific literature on CBM in rolling bearing and face cutting movements, papers dealing with rotary labeling machines are very unusual and unique.","Acernese, A; Del Vecchio, C; Tipaldi, M; Battilani, N; Glielmo, L",10.1108/JQME-10-2019-0101,journalArticle,DEPZQFGV,2021,,1

PhishOut: Effective Phishing Detection Using Selected Features [arXiv],NO,,,,"Phishing emails are the first step for many of today's attacks. They come with a simple hyperlink, request for action or a full replica of an existing service or website. The goal is generally to trick the user to voluntarily give away his sensitive information such as login credentials. Many approaches and applications have been proposed and developed to catch and filter phishing emails. However, the problem still lacks a complete and comprehensive solution. In this paper, we apply knowledge discovery principles from data cleansing, integration, selection, aggregation, data mining to knowledge extraction. We study the feature effectiveness based on Information Gain and contribute two new features to the literature. We compare six machine-learning approaches to detect phishing based on a small number of carefully chosen features. We calculate false positives, false negatives, mean absolute error, recall, precision and F-measure and achieve very low false positive and negative rates. Naive Bayes has the least true positives rate and overall Neural Networks holds the most promise for accurate phishing detection with accuracy of 99.4%.","Paliath, S.; Abu Qbeitah, M.; Aldwairi, M.",,journalArticle,NWARC76E,2020,,1
Improving the Reliability of Computational Analyses: Model-Based Planning and Its Relationship With Compulsivity,NO,,,,"Background Computational models show great promise in mapping latent decision-making processes onto dissociable neural substrates and clinical phenotypes. One prominent example in reinforcement learning is model-based planning, which specifically relates to transdiagnostic compulsivity. However, the reliability of computational model-derived measures such as model-based planning is unclear. Establishing reliability is necessary to ensure that such models measure stable, traitlike processes, as assumed in computational psychiatry. Although analysis approaches affect validity of reinforcement learning models and reliability of other task-based measures, their effect on reliability of reinforcement learning models of empirical data has not been systematically studied. Methods We first assessed within- and across-session reliability and effects of analysis approaches (model estimation, parameterization, and data cleaning) of measures of model-based planning in patients with compulsive disorders (n = 38). The analysis approaches affecting test-retest reliability were tested in 3 large generalization samples (healthy participants: n = 541 and 111; people with a range of compulsivity: n = 1413). Results Analysis approaches greatly influenced reliability: reliability of model-based planning measures ranged from 0 (no concordance) to above 0.9 (acceptable for clinical applications). The largest influence on reliability was whether model-estimation approaches were robust and accounted for the hierarchical structure of estimated parameters. Improvements in reliability generalized to other datasets and greatly reduced the sample size needed to find a relationship between model-based planning and compulsivity in an independent dataset. Conclusions These results indicate that computational psychiatry measures such as model-based planning can reliably measure latent decision-making processes, but when doing so must assess the ability of methods to estimate complex models from limited data.","Brown, Vanessa M.; Chen, Jiazhou; Gillan, Claire M.; Price, Rebecca B.",10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.12.019,journalArticle,N7BUMGE9,2020,,1

A novel data repairing approach based on constraints and ensemble learning,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Data repairing is an important task in data mining. This paper proposes a novel data repairing approach based on a combination of constraints and ensemble learning. At first, functional dependencies (FDs) are used as constraints to identify inconsistent records. For each FD, all repeated values in the correct records are discovered. After that, noisy attributes in erroneous records are detected using correct records and the repeated values. To correct the detected noises, a supervised ensemble learning model is constructed for each attribute. The ensemble model consists of a Bayes classifier, a decision tree, and a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). A majority of votes is used as the combination strategy in the ensemble learning model. The proposed approach automatically repairs data without any user interaction. Moreover, the proposed method can detect more than one noise in a record. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms similar repairing algorithms (HoloClean and KATARA) in both terms of precision and recall.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ataeyan, Mahdieh; Daneshpour, Negin",10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113511,journalArticle,NMY7LTWY,2020,aug,1

Picket: guarding against corrupted data in tabular data during learning and inference,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,features,"Data corruption is an impediment to modern machine learning deployments. Corrupted data can severely bias the learned model and can also lead to invalid inferences. We present, Picket, a simple framework to safeguard against data corruptions during both training and deployment of machine learning models over tabular data. For the training stage, Picket identifies and removes corrupted data points from the training data to avoid obtaining a biased model. For the deployment stage, Picket flags, in an online manner, corrupted query points to a trained machine learning model that due to noise will result in incorrect predictions. To detect corrupted data, Picket uses a self-supervised deep learning model for mixed-type tabular data, which we call PicketNet. To minimize the burden of deployment, learning a PicketNet model does not require any human-labeled data. Picket is designed as a plugin that can increase the robustness of any machine learning pipeline. We evaluate Picket on a diverse array of real-world data considering different corruption models that include systematic and adversarial noise during both training and testing. We show that Picket consistently safeguards against corrupted data during both training and deployment of various models ranging from SVMs to neural networks, beating a diverse array of competing methods that span from data quality validation models to robust outlier detection models.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Liu, Zifan; Zhou, Zhechun; Rekatsinas, Theodoros",10.1007/s00778-021-00699-w,journalArticle,IY6AKJ6T,2021,aug,1

Comparing Different Pre-processing Techniques and Machine Learning Models to Predict PM10 and PM2.5 Concentration in Malaysia,NO,,,,"A recent report from world health organization (WHO) showed that there are in total of 3.7 million deaths that were attributed with outdoor ambient pollution. Particulate matter (PM) has been considered by many as the major contributor of air pollution, it poses serious health risks towards human that are mostly associated with cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Even though various studies have been carried out to predict the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5, there are only a handful of papers that focused on the pre-processing aspect of the prediction. In this study, the importance of data pre-processing steps were assessed for PM10 and PM2.5 prediction in Malaysia, these cover: Data cleaning (handling missing values), data transformation (standardization, normalization, robust scaling, and min-max scaling), features selection (univariate linear regression and mutual info regression), and dimensionality reduction (principle component analysis) techniques. Four different machine learning models were utilized for the predictions: Multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), extra tree regression (ETR), and Decision tree regression with AdaBoost (BTR). The result showed that the best PM10 and PM2.5 prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.97, 0.92) were achieved by using BTR model coupled with normalization and PCA techniques, in which the missing data were imputed with median values.","Djarum, D.H.; Ahmad, Z.; Zhang, J.",10.1007/978-981-16-0742-4_25,conferencePaper,35V3QEUX,2021,,1
Unknown Class Label Cleaning for Learning with Open-Set Noisy Labels,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,features,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on large-scale annotated datasets have achieved impressive results in the area of image classification. Many large-scale datasets have been collected from websites; however, such data are inevitably corrupted with noise. In this study, we researched the open-set noisy label problem, where some outliers are contained in a dataset and annotated through a noisy label but do not belong to any class of training data. To address this problem, we propose a novel unknown class label cleaning framework for the training of DNNs with open-set noisy labels. In addition to general image classification, we also estimate the probability of an input being from an unknown class by assigning a pseudo unknown label to all of the data and correct these labels through an alternating update of the network parameters and labels. The results of experiments conducted on the noisy CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our approach can robustly train DNNs with a high proportion of noisy labels.  2020 IEEE.","Yu, Qing; Aizawa, Kiyoharu",10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9190652,conferencePaper,56IN2KKP,2020,aug,1

Correcting Corrupted Labels Using Mode Dropping of ACGAN,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,label,"Machine learning often requires a large amount of training data, and the training data obtained from various sources is often of poor quality, such as a large number of corrupted labels. Researchers using machine learning often apply some data cleaning techniques to clean up corrupted data. There are two popular methods to clean corrupted data: one is to set manual cleaning rules, and the other is to use positive samples for machine learning or statistical methods. Our work proposes a data cleaning method based on ACGAN since it is difficult to manually formulate cleaning rules, and there are often no positive samples of training data too. Our work does not need to artificially add cleaning rules or positive samples, and subtly uses mode dropping of GAN to eliminate the impact of noisy labels on corrupted data so which can be converted to relatively clean synthetic training data. Mode dropping of ACGAN will naturally happens, which is originally a disadvantage that usually needs to be eliminated in GAN, we tom the disadvantage into advantage, ACGAN will ignore some non-subject features when generating data, so as to eliminate the impact of noisy labels. And we also apply our method to correct noisy labels on corrupted training data.  2021 IEEE.","Su, Jizhong; Gao, Xing; Qin, Yipeng; Guo, Shihui",10.1109/ISMICT51748.2021.9434911,conferencePaper,6RCHW62Q,2021,aug,1

The Democratization of Machine Learning Features,NO,,,,"In the Machine Age, Machine learning (ML) becomes a secret sauce to success for any business. Machine learning applications are not limited to autonomous cars or robotics but are widely used in almost all sectors including finance, healthcare, entertainment, government systems, telecommunications, and many others. Due to a lack of enterprise ML strategy, many enterprises still repeat the tedious steps and spend most of the time massaging the required data. It is easier to access a variety of data because of big data lakes and data democratization. Despite it and decent advances in ML, engineers still spend significant time in data cleansing and feature engineering. Most of the steps are often repeated in this exercise. As a result, it generates identical features with variations that lead to inconsistent results in testing and training ML applications. It often stretches the time to go-live and increases the number of iterations to ship a final ML application. Sharing the best practices and best features are not only time-savers but they also help to jumpstart ML application development. The democratization of ML features is a powerful way to share useful features, to reduce time go-live, and to enable rapid ML application development. It is one of the emerging trends in enterprise ML application development and this paper presents details about a way to achieve ML feature democratization.  2020 IEEE.","Patel, Jayesh",10.1109/IRI49571.2020.00027,conferencePaper,57MJRXXW,2020,,1

Anomaly Detection and Repair for Accurate Predictions in Geo-distributed Big Data,Specific,,,,"The increasing presence of geo-distributed sensor networks implies the generation of huge volumes of data from multiple geographical locations at an increasing rate. This raises important issues which become more challenging when the final goal is that of the analysis of the data for forecasting purposes or, more generally, for predictive tasks. This paper proposes a framework which supports predictive modeling tasks from streaming data coming from multiple geo-referenced sensors. In particular, we propose a distance-based anomaly detection strategy which considers objects described by embedding features learned via a stacked auto-encoder. We then devise a repair strategy which repairs the data detected as anomalous exploiting non-anomalous data measured by sensors in nearby spatial locations. Subsequently, we adopt Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) to predict/forecast values assumed by a target variable of interest for the repaired newly arriving (unlabeled) data, using the original feature representation or the embedding feature representation learned via the stacked auto-encoder. The workflow is implemented with distributed Apache Spark programming primitives and tested on a cluster environment. We perform experiments to assess the performance of each module, separately and in a combined manner, considering the predictive modeling of one-day-ahead energy production, for multiple renewable energy sites. Accuracy results show that the proposed framework allows reducing the error up to 13.56%. Moreover, scalability results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of speedup, scaleup and execution time under a stress test.","Corizzo, Roberto; Ceci, Michelangelo; Japkowicz, Nathalie",10.1016/j.bdr.2019.04.001,journalArticle,A5XY5M2I,2019,,1

An Integrated Framework for Health State Monitoring in a Smart Factory Employing IoT and Big Data Techniques,NO,,,,"With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data & AI Innovation Awards.

OdoNet: Untethered Speed Aiding for Vehicle Navigation Without Hardware Wheeled Odometer,NO,,,,"Odometer has been proven to significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite System / Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) integrated vehicle navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, odometer is inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices and smartphones. To apply forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Dedicated experiments have been conducted to verify the generalization capability and the precision of the OdoNet. The results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet, while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Hence, a data-cleaning procedure is adopted to effectively mitigate the impacts of the IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the processing mode using only non-holonomic constraint (NHC), by employing the pseudo-odometer, the positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74% for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation.

The data set that we release, a MediaEval Database for Emotional Analysis in Music (DEAM), is the largest available data set of dynamic annotations (valence and arousal annotations for 1,802 songs and song excerpts licensed under Creative Commons with 2Hz time resolution). Using DEAM, we organized the 'Emotion in Music'task at MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation Campaign from 2013 to 2015. The benchmark attracted, in total, 21 active teams to participate in the challenge. We analyze the results of the benchmark: the winning algorithms and feature-sets. We also describe the design of the benchmark, the evaluation procedures and the data cleaning and transformations that we suggest.

Air quality analysis in critical zones of Mexico using unsupervised machine learning,NO,,,,"Air pollution continues to be a significant risk to public health. It is an important issue that affects everyone and should be studied to take actions that help mitigate the risk. This research's main objective is to explore air quality from 2010 to 2018 in metropolitan zones of Guadalajara, Monterrey, and the Valley of Mexico. Air quality is analyzed based on the concentrations of criteria pollutants: Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In this paper, six stages are proposed:1) data collection; 2) data cleansing; 3) descriptive analysis. 4) design of cluster analysis models and main components; 5) application of machine learning models; 6) interpretation and analysis of results. This study has concluded that higher mean hourly concentrations for pollutants, CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and SO2 were found in Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone. In contrast, the highest mean hourly concentration of PM10 was found in the Monterrey Metropolitan Zone. Furthermore, the pollutant with the highest effect in the three critical zones was PM2.5, presenting high concentrations with hazardous air quality levels.

Data cleaning for personal credit scoring by utilizing social media data: An empirical study,Specific,,,,"With the accumulation of data on personal behavior and the development of machine learning models and algorithms, it is becoming possible to use social media data for personal credit scoring. In this article, we use the systematic sampling method to obtain Douban's social media data. Because there are many abnormal users in these data, they are real but false data for personal credit evaluation. In order to better carry out personal credit scoring, we propose three criteria, power exponents of time interval distribution of individual user i, user activity Ai, and the ratio of out-degree and in-degree Ri of user i, which are used to systematically clean the data. And then, we used the logistic regression method to score the individual credits of users before and after data cleaning, and found that the rank order of personal credit scoring has changed significantly. This change is largely attributed to the changes of network structure after data cleaning. We believe that our work is very important to use the social media data to establish a credible personal credit evaluation system to reduce the credit risk of the current Internet financial industry.  2001-2011 IEEE.","Yu, Xi; Yang, Qi; Wang, Ruiqi; Fang, Runqing; Deng, Mingsen",10.1109/MIS.2020.2972214,journalArticle,VWUC7CSW,2020,,1

Research on intelligent analysis technology of power monitoring video data based on convolutional neural network,NO,,,,"With the rapid increase of on-site monitoring objects and technological development, the power on-site image monitoring data has increased geometrically. For security managers, it is necessary to efficiently and quickly identify valid data and conduct intelligent early warning. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent analysis method of power field surveillance video data based on convolutional neural network. Firstly, the original surveillance video material is extracted. Secondly, the video cloud storage platform is used for storage and data cleaning. At the same time, the hidden danger behaviors are classified and analyzed and marked.

AUTOMATED HARDENING OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES,NO,,,,"Designing optimal neural network (NN) architectures is a difficult and time-consuming task, especially when error resiliency and hardware efficiency are considered simultaneously. In our paper, we extend neural architecture search (NAS) to also optimize a NNs error resilience and hardware related metrics in addition to classification accuarcy. To this end, we consider the error sensitivity of a NN on the architecture-level during NAS and additionally incorporate checksums into the network as an external error detection mechanism. With an additional computational overhead as low as 17 % for the discovered architectures, checksums are an efficient method to effectively enhance the error resilience of NNs. Furthermore, the results show that cell-based NN architectures are able to maintain their error resilience characteristics when transferred to other tasks.

IGAEM: Improved Genetic Algorithm based Entity Matching,YES,ML4DC,tabular,el,"The presence of duplicate records is a major data quality concern in huge datasets. To detect duplicates, entity matching is used as an essential step of the data cleaning process to map records that refer to the same real-world entity. Most of proposed algorithms require labeled data in order to train a classifier. However, we cannot always obtain labeled data. In our paper we propose an unsupervised approach for entity matching problem using an improved version of genetic algorithm. We explain the main improvements added to genetic algorithm and the encoding strategy to encode partitions in the form of a chromosome. Different similarity functions are used to compute similarities between records. The obtained results prove that our proposition stands as a powerful approach in the entity matching field where it outperforms the traditional genetic algorithm based approach.

Synergy of database techniques and machine learning models for string similarity search and join,NO,,,,"String data is ubiquitous and string similarity search and join are critical to the applications of information retrieval, data integration, data cleaning, and also big data analytics. To support these operations, many techniques in the database and machine learning areas have been proposed independently. More precisely, in the database research area, there are techniques based on the filtering- and-verification framework that can not only achieve a high performance, but also provide guaranteed quality of results for given similarity functions. In the machine learning research area, string similarity processing is modeled as a problem of identifying similar text records; Specifically, the deep learning approaches use embedding techniques that map text to a low-dimensional continuous vector space. In this tutorial, we review a number of studies of string similarity search and join in these two research areas. We divide the studies in each area into different categories. For each category, we provide a comprehensive review of the relevant works, and present the details of these solutions. We conclude this tutorial by pinpointing promising directions for future work to combine techniques in these two areas.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Lu, Jiaheng; Wang, Jin; Lin, Chunbin; Li, Chen",10.1145/3357384.3360319,conferencePaper,ILM8L5UL,2019,,1

Deep learning with apache SystemML,NO,,,,"Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML) that focuses on learning hierarchical representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction using neural networks [15]. Recent advances in deep learning are made possible due to the availability of large amounts of labeled data, use of GPGPU compute, and application of new techniques (such as ReLU, batch normalization [12], dropout [17], residual block [10], etc.) that help deal with issues in training deep networks. In spite of the need to train on large datasets, there is a disconnect between the deep learning community and the big data community. To scale to a multi-node cluster, most deep learning frameworks (such as Caffe2, TensorFlow [2] and IBM's PowerAI DDL [6]) use custom communication libraries based on either MPI (such as IBM Spectrum MPI, Facebook's Gloo) or a custom networking protocol(such as Google RPC). Unlike popular big data frameworks (such as Apache Hadoop [9] and Apache Spark [18]), these communication libraries do not provide features such as resource sharing, multi-tenancy and fault-tolerance out of the box, making them difficult to deploy on shared production clusters. This leads to ineffective use of resources in an organization, often requiring two separate infrastructures (i.e. scale-up versus scale-out). This problem is even more severe when the data generated as part of the big data pipeline (ML, data preprocessing, data cleaning) needs to be consumed by the deep learning pipeline or vice versa, as the workload characteristics of a typical machine learning algorithm (i.e. memory-bound, BLAS level-2, sparse/ultrasparse inputs (or feature matrix), etc.) are often different than that of a typical deep learning algorithm (i.e. compute-bound, BLAS level-3, dense inputs, etc.). Apache SystemML [4] aims to bridge that gap by seamlessly integrating with underlying big data frameworks and by providing a unified framework for implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

Data cleansing for deep neural networks with storage-efficient approximation of influence functions,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,features,"Identifying the influence of training data for data cleansing can improve the accuracy of deep learning. An approach with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) called SGD-influence to calculate the influence scores was proposed, but, the calculation costs are expensive. It is necessary to temporally store the parameters of the model during training phase for inference phase to calculate influence sores. In close connection with the previous method, we propose a method to reduce cache files to store the parameters in training phase for calculating inference score. We only adopt the final parameters in last epoch for influence functions calculation. In our experiments on classification, the cache size of training using MNIST dataset with our approach is 1.236 MB. On the other hand, the previous method used cache size of 1.932 GB in last epoch. It means that cache size has been reduced to 1/1,563. We also observed the accuracy improvement by data cleansing with removal of negatively influential data using our approach as well as the previous method. Moreover, our simple and general proposed method to calculate influence scores is available on our auto ML tool without programing, Neural Network Console.

Does Data Repair Lead to Fair Models? Curating Contextually Fair Data To Reduce Model Bias,related,,,,"Contextual information is a valuable cue for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn better representations and improve accuracy. However, co-occurrence bias in the training dataset may hamper a DNNmodel's generalizabil- ity to unseen scenarios in the real world. For example, in COCO [26], many object categories have a much higher cooccurrence with men compared to women, which can bias a DNN's prediction in favor of men. Recent works have focused on task-specific training strategies to handle bias in such scenarios, but fixing the available data is often ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel and more generic solution to address the contextual bias in the datasets by selecting a subset of the samples, which is fair in terms of the co-occurrence with various classes for a protected attribute. We introduce a data repair algorithm using the coefficient of variation( cv), which can curate fair and contextually balanced data for a protected class(es). This helps in training a fair model irrespective of the task, architecture or training methodology. Our proposed solution is simple, effective and can even be used in an active learning setting where the data labels are not present or being generated incrementally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of object detection and multi-label image classification across different datasets. Through a series of experiments, we validate that curating contextually fair data helps make model predictions fair by balancing the true positive rate for the protected class across groups without compromising on the model's overall performance.

Spatial Classification With Limited Observations Based On Physics-Aware Structural Constraint [arXiv],NO,,,,"Spatial classification with limited feature observations has been a challenging problem in machine learning. The problem exists in applications where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial responses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation, classification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing features as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of samples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have missing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is observed for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint from the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient algorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the extended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world hydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature distribution in training samples is multi-modal. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets.","Sainju, A.M.; Wenchong He; Zhe Jiang; Da Yan; Haiquan Chen",,journalArticle,EZPPF9EH,2020,,1

Multilabeling Indonesian Toxic Comments Classification Using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers Model,NO,,,,"The main goal of this study is to create a language model to identify and classify multi-label on toxic comments that exist in social media. However, toxic comments classification faces a problem: one single toxic comment can have more than one class or label. Therefore, traditional algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or else cannot handle this type of classification efficiently because to analyze toxic comments, a model needs to understand language context. For that reason, we use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers), which can learn language bidirectionally. Two models (bert-base-multilingual-uncased and indobert-base-p1) will be trained and compared. The data used in this study is acquired from Twitter and will go through a pre-processing phase that includes case folding, data cleaning, normalization, and non-alphanumeric removal before it is used to train BERT.

Combining outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization for label noise reduction,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",?,label,"Label noise is a common phenomenon when labeling a large-scale dataset for supervised learning. Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.",Weining Zhang; Xiaoyang Tan,10.1109/BIGCOMP.2019.8679275,conferencePaper,GSCAS4PM,2019,aug,1

The feature is used by five ML models on four different data-window sizes. The results indicated a tradeoff between the execution speed and detection accuracy in variety of data-window size choices.

Table detection in invoice documents by graph neural networks,NO,,,,"Tabular structures in documents offer a complementary dimension to the raw textual data, representing logical or quantitative relationships among pieces of information. In digital mail room applications, where a large amount of administrative documents must be processed with reasonable accuracy, the detection and interpretation of tables is crucial.

In this work, we propose a graph-based approach for detecting tables in document images.

Efficient harbor craft monitoring system: Time-series data analytics and machine learning tools to achieve fuel efficiency by operational scoring system,NO,,,,"This paper presents the analysis to reduce carbon emission from tugboat operations by utilizing a proposed unsupervised machine learning operational scoring system. The time-series analysis is performed by transforming data into a common domain for clustering. The data are collected from a tugboat to investigate the correlation between environmental and location data with fuel consumption to achieve fuel efficiency. The relevant parameters that influence the fuel consumption of the tugboat, such as fuel consumption, vessel route, vessel speed and wind metrics are collected from sensors installed onboard the ship and data provider to monitor and to gauge the vessel's performance. The raw readings are conditioned (data cleaning and data pre-processing) before transformation to Score Dataset: the Raw mass-flowrate readings are cleaned by using the Haar wavelet; the wind raw reading is converted to wind effect data; the Location data is converted to vessel speed data. Together, they form a Score Dataset by applying the time series K-means clustering. The subsequent unsupervised learning identifies the activity labels that describe qualitatively the operations of the vessels and are obtained by using the non-time series K-mean clustering. By using the Hidden Markov Model approach, this paper attempts to explain the stochastic correlation among parameters explained earlier. The correlation is the information of newly discovered knowledge in terms of likelihood matrices, also known as the knowledge base (KB). The KB may be consumed to perform predictions. Hence, it is possible to suggest the optimal ship operation, i.e., speed that produces the optimum fuel consumption. The Score Dataset and clustering that are produced in this paper could also be used in the Artificial Neural Network for future work.

Weed density estimation in soya bean crop using deep convolutional neural networks in smart agriculture,NO,,,,"Weeds are those unwanted plants that grow between cultivated crops, which reduce the purity of the crops. Crops are severely affected by weeds for their quality and yields. Farmers use the traditional method for weed removal that is time-consuming and also makes it difficult to identify the difference between weed and crop. This research proposes deep convolutional neural network based Inception V4 architecture approach for identifying weed density in soya bean crop fields using crop weed field image dataset (CFWID). This work uses RGB weed and crop images. It offers a data cleaning to eliminate background, and foreground vegetation using segmentation masked. Thereafter, the weed-density area is identified using vegetation segmentation, which is a major challenge in many of such research works. This approach is validated using the CFWID weed and crop dataset that consists of 1100 broadleaf, 2548 grass weed, and the remaining 736 weed images collected from soya bean crop fields and close-to-crop weeds. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 98.2% using 4384 weed images.

Reinforcement learning for data cleaning and data preparation,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,features,"Data cleaning and data preparation have been long-standing challenges in data science to avoid incorrect results, biases, and misleading conclusions obtained from ""dirty"" data. For a given dataset and a given analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal ML model quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start or which methods to use. Most current work focus either on proposing new data cleaning algorithms -often specific to certain types of data glitches considered in isolation and generally with no ""pipeline vision"" of the whole data preprocessing sequence- or on developing automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of the given ML model but that often rely on by-default preprocessing methods.

Sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, etc cannot understand the context of comments in depth about the semantic of words because it only learns the given patters such as the frequency of occurrence of words. We need a transfer learning approach such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which produces a bidirectional language model. The dataset used to do sentiment analysis goes through a pre-processing step which consists of case folding, data cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, stemming, and normalization, using libraries from NLTK and Sastrawi. In this study, the hyperparameters used were 10 epochs, learning rate of 2e-5, and a batch size 16 based on experiments of hyperparameters used in another studies. In sentiment analysis, we will be using a multilingual-cased-model BERTBASE model and it was carried out with three experiments. During this experiment, the accuracy gained in first experiment is 66%, while the second experiment was 68%, and the third experiment was 66%. So, the average accuracy obtained is 66,7%.  2021 IEEE.","Fimoza, Dwi; Amalia, Amalia; Henny Febriana Harumy, T.",10.1109/DATABIA53375.2021.9650096,conferencePaper,36IQBENE,2021,,1
GNEM: a generic one-to-set neural entity matching framework,NO,,,,"Entity Matching is a classic research problem in any data analytics pipeline, aiming to identify records referring to the same real-world entity. It plays an important role in data cleansing and integration. Advanced entity matching techniques focus on extracting syntactic or semantic features from record pairs via complex neural architectures or pre-trained language models. However, the performances always suffer from noisy or missing attribute values in the records. We observe that comparing one record with several relevant records in a collective manner allows each pairwise matching decision to be made by borrowing valuable insights from other pairs, which is beneficial to the overall matching performance. In this paper, we propose a generic one-to-set neural framework named GNEM for entity matching. GNEM predicts matching labels between one record and a set of relevant records simultaneously. It constructs a record pair graph with weighted edges and adopts the graph neural network to propagate information among pairs. We further show that GNEM can be interpreted as an extension and generalization of the existing pairwise matching techniques. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that GNEM consistently outperforms the existing pairwise entity matching techniques and achieves up to 8.4% improvement on F1-Score compared with the state-of-the-art neural methods.",Runjin Chen; Yanyan Shen; Dongxiang Zhang,10.1145/3442381.3450119,conferencePaper,5C3QPL37,2021,,1
Combining Outlier Detection and Reconstruction Error Minimization for Label Noise Reduction,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,label,"Label noise is a common phenomenon when labeling a large-scale dataset for supervised learning. Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.","Zhang, WN; Tan, XY; IEEE",,conferencePaper,CWCY8IJI,2019,aug,1

Feature Selection for Email Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning,NO,,,,"Phishing attacks are one of the emerging and devastating cyber-attacks. Email is now considered as an appropriate means of written correspondence. Phishing emails are emails intended to extract sensitive and confidential information from the receiver. Two prong presentations are the aims of this paper; first, the analysis to remove the Phishing features from the email, and second, a notable triumph to reduce the complex data set to a lower dimension with different features. The feature reduction process is based on classification and prediction accuracy. The training and testing dataset is a collection of 1500 data tuples from the SPAMASSASIAN corpus. The validation dataset is made by retrieving the emails from Gmail users. To decide the two class codes, PHISHING and HAM, a total of 2000 emails are used to train, test, and validate the data tuples. In this research, 1000 emails are used to train, 500 emails are used to test the data tuples and validate them. First, the dataset is preprocessed to parse the data using HTML Parsing, Data Cleaning, Stemming, Stop Word Elimination, and Tokenization. By reading each email iteratively from the dataset, the features are extracted. Classifier ensemble strategies have gained the attention of many researchers in the machine learning research community in recent years [1]. Three machine learning classification algorithms are applied to predict the PHISHING and HAM emails such as decision trees (J48), random forest, and logistic regression. It was found that the random forest algorithm works best to separate PHISHING and HAM emails with the precision of a 99% classifier. With 15 feature sets, it fits best, the accuracy of training and validation is calculated to be 95.6% and 99.4%, respectively.","Yadav, N.; Panda, S.P.",10.1007/978-981-16-2597-8_31,journalArticle,D2PW4NJC,2022,,1

An Outlier Cleaning Algorithm Based on Deep Learning,Specific,,,,"The use of appropriate abnormal data cleaning algorithms in the Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve data quality. Statistical methods or clustering methods are utilized to clean anomalies in Spatio-temporal data. However, these methods require additional prior knowledge, which will incur additional computational overhead for the sink node. In this paper, in line with the low-rank sparse matrix decomposition model, a fast anomaly cleaning algorithm based on a deep neural network is proposed to solve the Spatio-temporal data cleaning problem in IoT. Both the Spatio-temporal correlation of sensing data and the abnormal values' sparsity are considered in an optimization problem. The Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) is used to solve it. Then the ISTA is unfolded into a fixed-length deep neural network. The real-world dataset's experimental results show that the proposed method can automatically update the thresholds faster and more accurately than the traditional ISTA.  2022, Science Press.

Development of Virtual Skill Trainers and Their Validation Study Analysis Using Machine Learning,NO,,,,"Minimally invasive skills assessment is important in developing competent surgical simulators and executing reliable skills evaluation [9]. Arthroscopy and Laparoscopy surgeries are considered Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS). In MIS, the surgeon operates through small incisions with specialized narrow instruments, fiberoptic lights, and a monitor. Arthroscopy surgery is used to diagnose and treat joints problems, and Laparoscopic procedures are performed on the abdominal cavity. Due to non-natural hand-eye coordination, narrow field-of-view, and limited instrument control, MIS training is challenging to master. We are analyzing two simulators' data, Virtual Arthroscopic Tear Diagnosis and Evaluation Platform (VATDEP) and Gentleness Simulator. Both simulators went through the validation studies with human subjects. We recorded simulation data during the validation studies, such as tool motion, position, and task time. Recorded data went through the data preprocessing; after the data cleaning, we extracted the recoded data features and normalized them. Normalized features were used to input various machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic regression (LR). The average accuracy was evaluated through k-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods validated using 10 subjects (5 experts, 5 novices) for the VATDEP simulator. 23 subjects (4 experts and 19 novices) for the Gentleness Simulator. The result shows a significant difference between the expert and novice population with the p  0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The VATDEP simulator's classification algorithms' average accuracy is 74% and 80% for the Gentleness Simulator. The results show that the normalized features and with KNN, SVM, and LR classifiers can provide accurate classification of experts and novices. The evaluation technique proposed in this study can develop surgical training by providing appropriate feedback to trainees to evaluate proficiency.  2021 ACM.","Shedage, Seema; Farmer, Jake; Demirel, Doga; Halic, Tansel; Kockara, Sinan; Arikatla, Venkata; Sexton, Kevin; Ahmadi, Shahryar",10.1145/3471287.3471296,conferencePaper,PV6JZYZB,2021,,1

Development and application of a real-time drilling state classification algorithm with machine learning,NO,,,,"A fundamental component of a real-time drilling analytics system is automatic rig state detection. High frequency time series data (typically one data point per second) from multiple sensors on a drilling rig is processed and labeled with drilling states including: slide drilling, rotate drilling, pick up, in slips, and others. With labeled time-series data, the real-time system can derive operational KPIs (key performance indicators) with extremely high resolution, e.g., a statistical summary of rotary versus slide drilling time for the rig supervisor and drilling engineer to analyze efficiency. Later, such information can be leveraged to develop algorithms to detect abnormal drilling events and drive closed loop control. A workflow was developed to clean and fill in any missing data. A rules-based model was then applied to classify the data into seventeen rig states. For the state ""drilling"", a sub-classification was made to label rotate drilling and slide drilling. However, it is difficult to categorize ""slide drilling"" solely based on surface RPM due to top drive oscillation. In order to achieve acceptable accuracies, three machine learning models to classify ""rotate drilling"" and ""slide drilling"" were evaluated: Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network / Recurrent Neural Network (CNN/RNN). Machine learning models were built for two basins, one model each, to accommodate different drilling styles. For the Delaware Basin, 10 wells with 9 million rows of data were chosen, and for the DJ Basin, 12 wells with 2 million rows of data were chosen. A legacy, rules-based algorithm was applied to label each row as rotate or slide drilling, and the misclassified records were manually corrected. The machine learning models were found to be far superior to rules-based models. For the wells in the training set, the accuracies of our rules-based models were 70% and 90% respectively, while the accuracies of our machine learning models were over 99%. The CNN model was proven to be the best model, excelling with high accuracy, short computation time, and scalability for big data applications. The data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning algorithm has been deployed in Anadarko's Real-Time Drilling (RTD) ecosystem (Cao et al., 2018, 2019), which consists of four layers: a data source, analytics, data storage, and UI layer. KPIs, directional statistics, and engineering models are calculated in real-time and visualized through a web-based UI. This system can be accessed by any member of the drilling operations team. The system is regularly used to evaluate, compare, and optimize well performance. Future plans include pushing analytical models to the rig site with edge computing to facilitate drilling guidance and levels of automation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning model has been used to analyze drilling time series data in a production real-time system.  2019, Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC)","Ben, Yuxing; James, Chris; Cao, Dingzhou",10.15530/urtec-2019-253,conferencePaper,WIPPPE8K,2020,,1

Micro-lending default awareness using artificial neural network,NO,,,,"Lending ways plays as a key sector in banking business. In recent years, small amount lending, so-called micro-lending, has become the popular trend due to the prosperous development of internet financial service. The high profit has driven banks to bear the so-called credit risk that the borrower may default or delay the repayment of the loan. To prevent from or to predict the credit risk, there are many methodologies widely applied, such as the credit scoring system with credit score-card, the Logistic Regression (LR) for assessing repayment ability or linear scoring function like Bayesian Decision Rules for credit risk of lending. These traditional methods need substantial information to do the analysis of customer lending. However, for general public, the applicant's information of micro-lending is usually less complete, not to mention to fill out the information of score-card. If we applied the above traditional methods for credit risk measurement, the accuracy of predicting the default usually is not as expected due to the incompleteness of information. It is, therefore, studies on the credit-risk measurement of micro-lending have become crucial. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for credit-risk measurement of micro-lending. To learn the pattern of bad credit, the methodology of data cleaning and Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPN) are adopted. The dataset of loan information from a Brazilian commercial bank is used to run the process of credit default awareness. Based on the experiment outcomes, we proved that the Artificial Neural Network can significantly improve the accuracy of the perception while reducing the chance of misjudgment of the lending.  2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Li, Li-Hua; Lin, Chi-Tien; Chen, Shin-Fu",10.1145/3145511.3145515,conferencePaper,89S882I8,2017,,1

Data-driven and Deep-learning-based Ultra-short-term Wind Power Prediction,NO,,,,"Mining the causal correlation between wind power and wind energy, as well as the spatio-temporal correlation among multiple wind farms from multi-source, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal wind power data, is an effective way to improve the accuracy of wind power prediction.

First, in the data preprocessing stage, the scene of the wind farm operating at full power output and wind speed overflowing is regarded as the abnormal and fault state of wind power prediction, and the corresponding data-cleaning method is proposed to enhance the correlation between the wind speed and wind power. Then, aiming at the causal correlation between meteorological data and wind power, multi-channel convolution is designed to mine the coupling relationship; aiming at the spatio-temporal correlation between adjacent wind farms, the multi-scale convolution is designed to mine wind power characteristics with different spatio-temporal scales, and these spatio-temporal characteristics are weighted, fused, and reduced through the 11 convolution layer. Finally, the fusion characteristics are input into the gated recurrent network to mine the time correlation and output the prediction results of wind power for multiple wind farms.

A novel data cleaning method for learning in imbalanced datasets based on k-nearest neighbors,NO,,,,"With the expansion of the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in various areas, many challenges have arisen in the training of learning algorithms. One of the most important challenges is the learning in imbalanced datasets. The imbalanced data generally refers to a classification problem where the number of data samples per class is not equally distributed. Typically there is a large amount of data for one class (referred to as the majority class) and much fewer data for the other class (referred to as the minority class). In such datasets, learning algorithms are biased toward learning the majority class to reach better accuracy, which leads to the lack of learning in minority class data. This article first introduces a method called neighbor competition scoring (NCS) for assigning scores to samples. Each data point is assigned a lower score if it is farther away from its class samples or closer to the samples of other classes. Then, with the help of these scores, neighbor competition undersampling (NCU) method is presented for undersampling the majority class samples that are less important than other samples. The proposed method has been compared with some popular data-based methods in 10 datasets and has performed better according to the experiments.  2020 IEEE.","Panahi, Rasool; Sedghiye, Nima; Nazerfard, Ehsan",10.1109/ICCKE50421.2020.9303625,conferencePaper,LFV6FD8K,2020,,1

Smart Data Management of Urban Infrastructure Using Geographic Information Systems,NO,,,,"Cities all over the world are converting maps of their infrastructure systems from legacy formats [such as paper maps and computer-aided design (CAD) drawings] to geographic information systems (GIS). Compared with CAD, GIS tend to offer more flexibility in terms of managing, updating, analyzing, and processing data. Nonetheless, the conversion process to GIS can be extremely challenging from a technical point of view. Moreover, the original data in a legacy format often contain errors, and pieces of infrastructure are often missing. What is more, even once the conversion process is complete, the maintenance of the data and the fusion of the data set with other data sets can be challenging. Leveraging recent technological advances (such as machine learning and semantic reasoning), this paper proposes a framework to better manage infrastructure data. More specifically, a smart data-management protocol is presented to successfully convert infrastructure maps from CAD to GIS that includes a data-cleaning procedure in CAD and machine-learning algorithmic solutions to validate or suggest edits of the infrastructure once converted to GIS. In addition, the protocol includes elements of version control to keep track of how urban infrastructure evolves over time as well as a procedure to combine GIS infrastructure maps with other data sets (such as sociodemographic data) that can be used for optimal scheduling of asset maintenance and repair.

"Model, Data and Reward Repair: Trusted Machine Learning for Markov Decision Processes",NO,,,,"When machine learning (ML) models are used in safety-critical or mission-critical applications (e.g., self driving cars, cyber security, surgical robotics), it is important to ensure that they provide some high-level guarantees (e.g., safety, liveness). We introduce a paradigm called Trusted Machine Learning (TML) for making ML models more trustworthy. We use Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as the underlying dynamical model and outline three TML approaches: (1) Model Repair, wherein we modify the learned model directly; (2) Data Repair, wherein we modify the data so that re-learning from the modified data results in a trusted model; and (3) Reward Repair, wherein we modify the reward function of the MDP to satisfy the specified logical constraint. We show how these repairs can be done efficiently for probabilistic models (e.g., MDP) when the desired properties are expressed in some appropriate fragment of logic such as temporal logic (for example PCTL, i.e., Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic), first order logic or propositional logic. We illustrate our approaches on case studies from multiple domains, e.g., car controller for obstacle avoidance, and a query routing controller in a wireless sensor network.  2018 IEEE.","Ghosh, Shalini; Jha, Susmit; Tiwari, Ashish; Lincoln, Patrick; Zhu, Xiaojin",10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00064,conferencePaper,NN8CC2BI,2018,,1

Typing errors in factual knowledge graphs: Severity and possible ways out,NO,,,,"Factual knowledge graphs (KGs) such as DBpedia and Wikidata have served as part of various downstream tasks and are also widely adopted by artificial intelligence research communities as benchmark datasets. However, we found these KGs to be surprisingly noisy. In this study, we question the quality of these KGs, where the typing error rate is estimated to be 27% for coarse-grained types on average, and even 73% for certain fine-grained types. In pursuit of solutions, we propose an active typing error detection algorithm that maximizes the utilization of both gold and noisy labels. We also comprehensively discuss and compare unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms to deal with typing errors in factual KGs. The outcomes of this study provide guidelines for researchers to use noisy factual KGs.

Integration of Fuzzy C-Means and Artificial Neural Network for Short-Term Localized Rainfall Forecast in Tropical Climate,NO,,,,"This paper evaluates the performance of a rainfall forecasting model. In this paper Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm are combined and used to forecast short-term localized rainfall in tropical climate. State forecast (raining or not raining) and value forecast (rain intensity) are tested using a number of trained networks. Different types of ANN structured were trained with a combination of multilayer perceptron with back propagation network. Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization and Scaled Conjugate Gradient training algorithm are used in the network training. Each neurons uses linear, logistic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid as transfer function. Input parameter preliminary analysis, data cleaning and FCM clustering were used to prepare input data for the ANN forecast model. Meteorological data such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, dew point, humidity and wind speed have been used as input parameters. The predicted rainfall forecast for 1 to 6 h ahead are compared and analyzed. 1 h ahead for state and value forecast yield high accuracy. Result shows that, the combined of FCM-ANN forecast model produces better accuracy compared to a basic ANN forecast model.","Mohd-Safar, NZ; Ndzi, D; Sanders, D; Noor, HM; Kamarudin, LM",10.1007/978-3-319-56991-8_38,conferencePaper,TFMZ354H,2018,,1

Given the 21th centurys exponential growth of big-data environments, knowing the precise breaks position of DNA sequences is essential for many reasons including advanced medical intervention. This study designs an automated framework to assess the breaks positions in long DNA sequences which are responsible for TB and then empirically tests it by analyzing a big DNA dataset from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The method consists of a range of data cleansing and deep neural network tools for big data situation. Findings reveal that the proposed approach is better than other methods in detecting DNA sequence breaks for TB via resolving a sample size issue of the training dataset and recursively divide the whole dataset into certain length to detect the breaks. It also provides a faster predictive analysis with more accurate and reliable outcomes.","Rahman, A.; Nimmy, S.F.; Sarowar, G.",10.1007/978-3-319-93351-1_23,conferencePaper,J3RIFT9T,2019,,1

TSEA: An open source python-based annotation tool for time series data,NO,,,,"We present the Time Series Event Annotator (TSEA), a graphical user interface annotation tool for time series data that enables rapid visualization, labeling, and annotation of signals, including individual points and ranges. Time series data are common to a variety of applications. Oftentimes there is a need to label segments and/or points of the signals, highlighting important elements that are later used for feature extraction or for signal analysis. A number of illustrative applications of the developed tool are discussed, particularly for the detection of ""R""peaks from electrocardiogram signals. While algorithms for detection of ""R""peaks can achieve good results when applied to an electrocardiogram signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio, they often lead to incorrect detections in the presence of noise or motion artifact commonly found in clinical setups. In such cases, the Time Series Event Annotator (TSEA) enables efficient imputing of missed or incorrect ""R""peak detections, leading to increased data integrity for downstream analysis, at minimum cost. Considering that data cleaning often represents the majority of effort when developing a new machine learning pipeline, our annotation tool will accelerate the development of a wide range of new machine learning applications.  2021 IEEE.","Selzler, Roger; Chan, Adrian D.

A Prediction Methodology of Energy Consumption Based on Deep Extreme Learning Machine and Comparative Analysis in Residential Buildings,NO,,,,"In this paper, we have proposed a methodology for energy consumption prediction in residential buildings. The proposed method consists of four different layers, namely data acquisition, preprocessing, prediction, and performance evaluation. For experimental analysis, we have collected real data from four multi-storied residential building. The collected data are provided as input for the acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes were deployed to remove abnormalities from the data. In the prediction layer, we have used the deep extreme learning machine (DELM) for energy consumption prediction. Further, we have also used the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) in the prediction layer. In the DELM different numbers of hidden layers, different hidden neurons, and various types of activation functions have been used to achieve the optimal structure of DELM for energy consumption prediction. Similarly, in the ANN, we have employed a different combination of hidden neurons with different types of activation functions to get the optimal structure of ANN. To obtain the optimal structure of ANFIS, we have employed a different number and type of membership functions. In the performance evaluation layer for the comparative analysis of three prediction algorithms, we have used the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results indicate that the performance of DELM is far better than ANN and ANFIS for one-week and one-month hourly energy prediction on the given data.","Fayaz, M; Kim, D",10.3390/electronics7100222,journalArticle,9HMWFFHB,2018,,1

Synthetic Sonic Log Generation with Machine Learning: A Contest Summary from Five Methods,NO,,,,"Compressional and shear sonic traveltime logs (DTC and DTS, respectively) are crucial for subsurface characterization and seismic-well tie. However, these two logs are often missing or incomplete in many oil and gas wells. Therefore, many petrophysical and geophysical workflows include sonic log synthetization or pseudo-log generation based on multivariate regression or rock physics relations. Started on March 1,2020, and concluded on May 7, 2020, the SPWLA PDDA SIG hosted a contest aiming to predict the DTC and DTS logs from seven ""easy-to-acquire"" conventional logs using machine-learning methods (GitHub, 2020). In the contest, a total number of 20,525 data points with half-foot resolution from three wells was collected to train regression models using machine-learning techniques. Each data point had seven features, consisting of the conventional ""easy-to-acquire"" logs: caliper, neutron porosity, gamma ray (GR), deep resistivity, medium resistivity, photoelectric factor, and bulk density, respectively, as well as two sonic logs (DTC and DTS) as the target. The separate data set of 11,089 samples from a fourth well was then used as the blind test data set. The prediction performance of the model was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) as the metric, shown in the equation below: {equation presented}In the benchmark model, (Yu et al., 2020), we used a Random Forest regressor and conducted minimal preprocessing to the training data set; an RMSE score of 17.93 was achieved on the test data set. The top five models from the contest, on average, beat the performance of our benchmark model by 27% in the RMSE score. In the paper, we will review these five solutions, including preprocess techniques and different machine-learning models, including neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and ensemble trees. We found that data cleaning and clustering were critical for improving the performance in all models.  2021 Society of Well Log Analystists Inc..

Hybrid deep learning methods for phenotype prediction from clinical notes,NO,,,,"MSC Codes 68T50, 68T07Background and objectives: Identifying patient cohorts from clinical notes in secondary electronic health records is a fundamental task in clinical information management. The patient cohort identification needs to identify the patient phenotypes. However, with the growing number of clinical notes, it becomes challenging to analyze the data manually. Therefore, automatic extraction of clinical concepts would be an essential task to identify the patient phenotypes correctly. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model for automatically extracting patient phenotypes using natural language processing and deep learning models to determine the patient phenotypes without dictionaries and human intervention. Methods: The proposed hybrid model is based on a neural bidirectional sequence model (BiLSTM or BiGRU) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identifying patient's phenotypes in discharge reports. Furthermore, to extract more features related to each phenotype, an extra CNN layer is run parallel to the hybrid proposed model. The extra CNN layer improves the model in identifying different phenotypes. We used pre-trained embeddings such as FastText and Word2vec separately as the input layers to evaluate other embedding's performance in identifying patient phenotypes. We also measured the effect of applying additional data cleaning steps on discharge reports to identify patient phenotypes by deep learning models. Results: We used discharge reports in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III) database in our experiments to identify patient phenotypes. Experimental results in internal comparison demonstrate that the proposed model achieved significant performance improvement over existing models. In addition, we pre-trained embeddings using FastText and Word2vce on discharge reports in MIMIC III. The enhanced version of our model with an extra CNN layer obtained a relatively higher F1-score than the original hybrid model. We also showed that BiGRU layer with FastText embedding had better performance than BiLSTM layer to identify patient phenotypes. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model extracts more features than existing methods of extracting patient phenotypes and provides a better F1-score. We show that complementing the proposed hybrid model with an extra CNN in identifying different phenotypes improves the F1 scores. In addition, eliminating punctuation, numbers, and stop words in discharge reports before training hybrid models resulted in increased model performance.  2021, CC BY-NC-ND.","Khalafi, Sahar; Ghadiri, Nasser; Moradi, Milad",,journalArticle,3KLPJYUJ,2021,,1

Faster gradient-based NAS pipeline combining broad scalable architecture with confident learning rate,NO,,,,"In order to further improve the search efficiency of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), we propose B-DARTS, a novel pipeline combining broad scalable architecture with Confident Learning Rate (CLR). In B-DARTS, Broad Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) is employed as the scalable architecture for DARTS, a popular differentiable NAS approach. On one hand, BCNN is a broad scalable architecture whose topology achieves two advantages compared with the deep one, mainly including faster single-step training speed and higher memory efficiency (i.e. larger batch size for architecture search), which are all contributed to the search efficiency improvement of NAS. On the other hand, DARTS discovers the optimal architecture by gradient-based optimization algorithm, which benefits from two superiorities of BCNN simultaneously. Similar to vanilla DARTS, B-DARTS also suffers from the performance collapse issue, where those weight-free operations are prone to be selected by the search strategy. Therefore, we propose CLR, that considers the confidence of gradient for architecture weights update increasing with the training time of over-parameterized model, to mitigate the above issue. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that 1) B-DARTS delivers state-of-the-art efficiency of 0.09 GPU day using first order approximation on CIFAR-10; 2) the learned architecture by B-DARTS achieves competitive performance using state-of-the-art composite multiply-accumulate operations and parameters on ImageNet; and 3) the proposed CLR is effective for performance collapse issue alleviation of both B-DARTS and DARTS.

CIEA: A Corpus for Chinese Implicit Emotion Analysis,NO,,,,"The traditional cultural euphemism of the Han nationality has profound ideological roots. China has always advocated Confucianism, which has led to the implicit expression of Chinese people's emotions. There are almost no obvious emotional words in spoken language, which poses a challenge to Chinese sentiment analysis. It is very interesting to exploit a corpus that does not contain emotional words, but instead uses detailed description in text to determine the category of the emotional expressed. In this study, we propose a corpus for Chinese implicit sentiment analysis. To do this, we have crawled millions of microblogs. After data cleaning and processing, we obtained the corpus. Based on this corpus, we introduced conventional models and neural networks for implicit sentiment analysis, and achieve promising results. A comparative experiment with a well-known corpus showed the importance of implicit emotions to emotional classification. This not only shows the usefulness of the proposed corpus for implicit sentiment analysis research, but also provides a baseline for further research on this topic.","Li, DW; Wang, J; Zhang, XJ",,conferencePaper,WHPCPHYI,2019,,1

Methods of image recognition of overhead power line insulators and ice types based on deep weakly-supervised and transfer learning,NO,,,,"Insulator icing endangers the safe operation of overhead power lines. The current measures for image monitoring of icing overhead power lines rely on manual observation. There is an urgent need for image intelligent analysis methods with strong generalisation, accuracy, and efficiency to improve power grid decision-making. Based on the icing monitoring data from China Southern Power Grid, this paper first proposes rules for insulator image data cleaning, classification, and annotation, establishing a dataset of insulator icing monitoring images during 20142018. Then, based on Yolo (You only look once) v5, a weakly supervised and phased transfer learning method is proposed to recognise insulators and ice types such as snow, rime, mixed rime, glaze, and the normal. This method reduces the interference of icing background, uneven illumination, and camera occlusion through multidimensional feature fusion. The precision, recall, and mean average precision of the recognition can reach 86.6%, 91.3%, and 90.1%, respectively, and the recognition speed is as fast as 8ms/image. Using image pseudo-labelling based on weakly supervised learning enables the intellectualisation of image annotation, which significantly changes the inefficiency of manual labelling. 2022 The Authors.

Modifying Cleaning Method in Big Data Analytics Process using Random Forest Classifier,Specific,,,,"Accurate data is a key success factor influencing the performance of data analytics results, especially for the detection and prediction purpose. Nowadays, Big Data analytics (BDA) is used to analyze the sheer volume of data available in an organization. These data quality must be maintained in order to obtain correct alert and valuable insights from the rapidly changing data of high volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. This paper aim is to modify existing framework of big data analytics by improving an important step in pre-processing (i.e. Data Cleaning). Initially, feature selection based on Random Forest is used to extract effective features. Then, two classifier algorithms (i. e. Random Forest classifier and Linear SVM classifier) are applied to train using the dataset to classify data quality and to develop an intelligent model. In evaluation, our experimental results show a consistent accuracy of Random Forest and Linear Regression around 90%. Using this approach, we expect to provide a set of cleaned data for further processing. Besides, analysts can benefit from this system in data analytical process in cleaning stage and conclude that the data is cleaned. Finally, a comparison is presented between available functions which are used to handle missing values with the developed system","Hossen, J; Jesmeen, MZH; Sayeed, S; IEEE",,conferencePaper,CQ4I8CCX,2018,,1
A probabilistic database approach to autoencoder-based data cleaning,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",?,features,"Data quality problems are a large threat in data science. In this paper, we propose a data-cleaning autoencoder capable of near-automatic data quality improvement. It learns the structure and dependencies in the data and uses it as evidence to identify and correct doubtful values. We apply a probabilistic database approach to represent weak and strong evidence for attribute value repairs. A theoretical framework is provided, and experiments show that it can remove significant amounts of noise (i.e., data quality problems) from categorical and numeric probabilistic data. Our method does not require clean data. We do, however, show that manually cleaning a small fraction of the data significantly improves performance. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Implementing Predictive Model for Low Birth Weight in Afghanistan,NO,,,,"Birth weight is a significant determinant of the likelihood of survival of an infant. Low Birth Weight (LBW) has become an increasingly common problem, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. Therefore, an ability to predict the LBW is beneficial and a good preventive measure. It is also a good indicator of future health risks of that infant. This study is concerned about the implementation of predictive LBW models for rural and urban areas of Afghanistan based on the data obtained from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015. The main objective of the study is to identify the most suitable machine learning techniques (i.e. classifiers) among the five popular ones. These are K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Prior to implementing the predictive models, data preprocessing is carried out. This is done by means of data cleansing and feature selection. The well-known Correlation based Feature Selection algorithm (CFS) is employed to select the top ten attributes. The classifier in this study comprises two categories, Normal and LBW. The preparation of the dataset is carefully done to ensure well-balanced samples in each category. The study reveals that Random Forest is the best classifier with an accuracy of 84.70% and 85.2% and with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 91.0% and 92.1% for both rural and urban areas, respectively. The study has a direct benefit to the health and prevention policy making in Afghanistan.  2021 IEEE.","Zahirzada, Abdullah; Lavangnananda, Kittichai",10.1109/KST51265.2021.9415792,conferencePaper,XKE7AV72,2021,,1

Outliers classification for mining evolutionary community using Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression on Azure ML,NO,,,,"Evolutionary Community Outliers (ECO) is a type of outlier group in which the average evolutionary behavior of certain objects is different from the same community by some measures. The detection, classification and removal of ECO are a very important and challenging task of data cleaning and preprocessing. ECO is different from the old outlier detection technique, which detect objects that have fairly diverse nature as compared with the community objects. Different outlier detection and removal studies have been presented in the last few years, but there are some limitations due to the individual process at a time. The proposed research approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) at the same time to accurately classify, detect and remove the outliers form the Evolutionary community dataset, which is a new technique for outlier detection and removal. We have used Azure Machine Learning (ML) which is the state of the art data processing tool to test our proposed technique on the Forest Fire data of Southern Algarve Portugal to show the result, which gives us very good results on the given data. The accuracy of these outliers' detection and removal is 73-93 percent varying due to the data acquisition process. Proposed technique shows remarkable results in detecting diverse ECO on both real time and temporal datasets.","Dost, S.; Anwer, S.; Saud, F.; Shabbir, M.",10.1109/C-CODE.2017.7918931,conferencePaper,2A69IHXP,2017,,1

Intelligent and novel multi-type cancer prediction model using optimized ensemble learning,NO,,,,"Cancer is known to be highly severe disease and gets incurable even when the treatment has started at the time of diagnosis owing to the occurrence of cancer cells. Diverse machine learning approaches are implemented for predicting the cancer recurrence that needs to be evaluated for showing the appropriate approach for cancer prediction. This paper provides intelligent optimized ensemble learning for predicting multiple types of cancers. At first, the different types of cancer data are collected and performed the data cleansing. Then, the feature extraction is done using statistical features, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). With these features, a new Adaptive Condition Searched-Harris hawks Whale Optimization (ACS-HWO) is used for selecting the optimal features and transformed into weighted features with meta-heuristic update. The prediction is carried out by Optimized Ensemble-based Multi-disease Detection (OEMD) with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Autoencoder, Adaboost, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with high ranking strategy. The same ACS-HWO is used for improvising the weighted feature selection and optimized ensemble learning.

Data Management in Machine Learning Systems,Secondary works,,,,"Large-scale data analytics using machine learning (ML) underpins many modern data-driven applications. ML systems provide means of specifying and executing these ML workloads in an efficient and scalable manner. Data management is at the heart of many ML systems due to data-driven application characteristics, data-centric workload characteristics, and system architectures inspired by classical data management techniques. In this book, we follow this data-centric view of ML systems and aim to provide a comprehensive overview of data management in ML systems for the end-to-end data science or ML lifecycle. We review multiple interconnected lines of work: (1) ML support in database (DB) systems, (2) DB-inspired ML systems, and (3) ML lifecycle systems. Covered topics include: in-database analytics via query generation and user-defined functions, factorized and statistical-relational learning; optimizing compilers for ML workloads; execution strategies and hardware accelerators; data access methods such as compression, partitioning and indexing; resource elasticity and cloud markets; as well as systems for data preparation for ML, model selection, model management, model debugging, and model serving. Given the rapidly evolving field, we strive for a balance between an up-to-date survey of ML systems, an overview of the underlying concepts and techniques, as well as pointers to open research questions. Hence, this book might serve as a starting point for both systems researchers and developers. 2019 by Morgan & Claypool.","Boehm, Matthias; Kumar, Arun; Yang, Jun",10.2200/S00895ED1V01Y201901DTM057,journalArticle,P9ZM3U93,2019,,1

Can machines learn the mutation signatures of SARS-CoV-2 and enable viral-genotype guided predictive prognosis?,NO,,,,"Motivation Continuous emergence of new variants through appearance/accumulation/disappearance of mutations is a hallmark of many viral diseases. SARS-CoV-2 variants have particularly exerted tremendous pressure on global healthcare system owing to their life threatening and debilitating implications. The sheer plurality of variants and huge scale of genomic data have added to the challenges of tracing the mutations/variants and their relationship to infection severity (if any). Results We explored the suitability of virus-genotype guided machine-learning in infection prognosis and identification of features/mutations-of-interest. Total 199,519 outcome-traced genomes, representing 45,625 nucleotide-mutations, were employed. Among these, post data-cleaning, Low and High severity genomes were classified using an integrated model (employing virus genotype, epitopic-influence and patient-age) with consistently high ROC-AUC (Asia:0.97 ± 0.01, Europe:0.94 ± 0.01, N.America:0.92 ± 0.02, Africa:0.94 ± 0.07, S.America:0.93 ± 03). Although virus-genotype alone could enable high predictivity (0.97 ± 0.01, 0.89 ± 0.02, 0.86 ± 0.04, 0.95 ± 0.06, 0.9 ± 0.04), the performance was not found to be consistent and the models for a few geographies displayed significant improvement in predictivity when the influence of age and/or epitope was incorporated with virus-genotype (Wilcoxon p_BH < 0.05). Neither age or epitopic-influence or clade information could out-perform the integrated features. A sparse model (6 features), developed using patient-age and epitopic-influence of the mutations, performed reasonably well (>0.87 ± 0.03, 0.91 ± 0.01, 0.87 ± 0.03, 0.84 ± 0.08, 0.89 ± 0.05). High-performance models were employed for inferring the important mutations-of-interest using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The changes in HLA interactions of the mutated epitopes of reference SARS-CoV-2 were then subsequently probed. Notably, we also describe the significance of a ‘temporal-modeling approach’ to benchmark the models linked with continuously evolving pathogens. We conclude that while machine learning can play a vital role in identifying relevant mutations and factors driving the severity, caution should be exercised in using the genotypic signatures for predictive prognosis.","Nagpal, Sunil; Pinna, Nishal Kumar; Pant, Namrata; Singh, Rohan; Srivastava, Divyanshu; Mande, Sharmila S.",10.1016/j.jmb.2022.167684,journalArticle,6YP5FW37,2022,,1

Hardware-accelerated inference for real-time gravitational-wave astronomy,NO,,,,"There is a growing need for data cleaning and source identification for gravitational-wave detectors in real time. A deep learning inference-as-a-service framework using off-the-shelf software and hardware can address these challenges in a scalable and reliable way. Computational demands in gravitational-wave astronomy are expected to at least double over the next five years. As kilometre-scale interferometers are brought to design sensitivity, real-time delivery of gravitational-wave alerts will become increasingly important to enable multimessenger follow-up. Here we discuss a novel implementation and deployment of deep learning inference for real-time data denoising and astrophysical source identification. This objective is accomplished using a generic inference-as-a-service model capable of adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. The implementation allows seamless incorporation of hardware accelerators and also enables the use of commercial or private as-a-service computing. Low-latency and offline computing in gravitational-wave astronomy addresses key challenges in scalability and reliability and provides a data analysis platform particularly optimized for deep learning applications.","Gunny, A; Rankin, D; Krupa, J; Saleem, M; Nguyen, T; Coughlin, M; Harris, P; Katsavounidis, E; Timm, S; Holzman, B",10.1038/s41550-022-01651-w,journalArticle,2XWXTAUJ,2022,,1

The results indicate that 31 SSR primers were polymorphic, and also these primers with 334 alleles were analyzed. Analyses through data cleaning, attribute weighting, and machine learning classified the populations into different categories. The machine learning methods used here for classifying the potato accessions discovered that the SS110 was the best SSR primer for the potato population analysis, and also, it can be emphasized that the machine learning analyses are the best tool for the classification of potato populations based on populations specific genetic architecture.","Torabi-Giglou, M; Moharramnejad, S; Panahandeh, J; Ebadi-Segherloo, A; Ghasemi, E",10.1007/s40995-020-00896-2,journalArticle,KDLVQNW7,2020,,1

Establishment of probabilistic prediction models for pavement deterioration based on Bayesian neural network,NO,,,,"The process of pavement deterioration involves uncertainties, and neural networks have been widely used in pavement performance prediction due to their high accuracy. However, the overwhelming majority of current performance prediction models based on neural networks are deterministic. Therefore, this study combined Bayesian theory and neural networks to establish a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based probabilistic model for predicting pavement deterioration. The proposed model was built on the pavement data in Shanxi Province, China. This study first refined data using the K-Nearest Neighbour and empirical methods, and then selected input features based on correlation coefficient methods. Using the refined data, the deterministic neural network model was established to obtain the prior probability distribution of weights, and then the BNN-based probabilistic model was developed. Compared with the sole neural network model, the BNN-based model not only retains comparable prediction accuracy to the neural network model, but also incorporates uncertainties. The BNN-based model is also theoretically superior to the Markov-based probabilistic model because the former can incorporate all factors and does not need to classify performance values into states. The BNN-based model shall provide more reliable prediction results of pavement deterioration and help engineers make more reasonable maintenance decisions.","Xiao, F; Chen, XY; Cheng, JC; Yang, SX; Ma, Y",10.1080/10298436.2022.2076854,journalArticle,RTLPHHWS,0,,1

Movie Identification from Electroencephalography Response Using Convolutional Neural Network,NO,,,,"Visual, audio, and emotional perception by human beings have been an interesting research topic in the past few decades. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are one of the ways to represent human brain activity. It has been shown, that different brain networks correspond to processes corresponding to varieties of emotional stimuli. In this paper, we demonstrate a deep learning architecture for the movie identification task from the EEG response using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset includes nine movie clips that span across different emotional states. The EEG time series data has been collected for 20 participants. Given one second EEG response of particular participant, we tried to predict its corresponding movie ID. We have also discussed the various pre-processing steps for data cleaning and data augmentation process. All the participants have been considered in both train and test data. We obtained 80.22% test accuracy for this movie classification task. We also tried cross participant testing using the same model and the performance was poor for the unseen participants.

A Modified Initialization Method to Find an Initial Center for Fuzzy K-Modes Clustering,NO,,,,"Data mining is used to analyzing the data and extracts the information from large data sets. Clustering is a technique which is used to grouping the objects which is having similar characters. In existing system, K-Means clustering is used to cluster the numerical data but it does not cluster the categorical data. To overcome the limitation of using numeric data only in the clustering process, F Jiang proposed the initialization method for K-modes clustering in which the initial cluster centres were calculated using Ini_Distance and Ini_Entropy methods were used. To improve the performance further, a new modified model is proposed for Fuzzy K-modes clustering. In this model, a modified Initial_Distance and Initial_Entropy Initialization method are used. It ensures that K initial cluster centers are not selected from the same cluster and selected initial cluster centers are not outliers. Also, one of a data pre-processing methods-Data cleaning is used to increase the quality of clustering results and a new modified weight matching distance (WMD) is calculated by using distance between two objects at the time initialization. An experiment result is demonstrated with five data sets taken from UCI machine learning repository and the results proved the effectiveness of the initialization method.","Saranya, S; Jayanthi, P; IEEE",,conferencePaper,TE8NJ7NR,2017,,1

The use of receiver operating characteristic curves and precision-versus-recall curves as performance metrics in unsupervised structural damage classification under changing environment,NO,,,,"The development of long-term structural health monitoring systems is recently receiving a growing scientific interest in the field of Civil Engineering. In the context of unsupervised learning processes, deviations of dynamic parameters from their normal conditions can allow damage detection. However, due to the fact that modal properties are highly sensitive to environmental and operational factors, it is extremely important to remove such effects in order to obtain suitable damage sensitive features. In this regard, the selection of a proper multivariate statistical data analysis method for removing environmental effects is a key issue, heavily affecting the distribution of the residuals, the control chart and therefore the damage detection. However, specific criteria guiding the optimal definition of such statistical methods are yet to be established. In order to bridge this research gap, an original methodology is proposed in the present paper, based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves in combination with Precision-versus-Recall (PR) curves. Specifically, ROC and PR curves are computed and compared for a variety of statistical methods for data normalization and different damage scenarios and the model selection strategy is formulated as an optimization problem. The proposed approach is exemplified by application in two case studies of continuously monitored structures: the Z24 Bridge in Switzerland and the Consoli Palace, a mediaeval masonry building in Italy. The results highlight that the combined use of both ROC and PR curves represents a suitable tool for defining the most effective statistical data analysis method and the optimal damage threshold, in order to minimize the occurrence of false alarms and missing alarms.","Giglioni, Valentina; García-Macías, Enrique; Venanzi, Ilaria; Ierimonti, Laura; Ubertini, Filippo",10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113029,journalArticle,5XPNG3M6,2021,,1

WearGP: A computationally efficient machine learning framework for local erosive wear predictions via nodal Gaussian processes,NO,,,,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based wear predictions are computationally expensive to evaluate, even with a high-performance computing infrastructure. Thus, it is difficult to provide accurate local wear predictions in a timely manner. Data-driven approaches provide a more computationally efficient way to approximate the CFD wear predictions without running the actual CFD wear models. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach, termed WearGP, is presented to approximate the 3D local wear predictions, using numerical wear predictions from steady-state CFD simulations as training and testing datasets. The proposed framework is built on Gaussian process (GP) and utilized to predict wear in a much shorter time. The WearGP framework can be segmented into three stages. At the first stage, the training dataset is built by using a number of CFD simulations in the order of O(102). At the second stage, the data cleansing and data mining processes are performed, where the nodal wear solutions are extracted from the solution database to build a training dataset. At the third stage, the wear predictions are made, using trained GP models. Two CFD case studies including 3D slurry pump impeller and casing are used to demonstrate the WearGP framework, in which 144 training and 40 testing data points are used to train and test the proposed method, respectively. The numerical accuracy, computational efficiency and effectiveness between the WearGP framework and CFD wear model for both slurry pump impellers and casings are compared. It is shown that the WearGP framework can achieve highly accurate results that are comparable with the CFD results, with a relatively small size training dataset, with a computational time reduction on the order of 105 to 106.  2018 Elsevier B.V.","Tran, Anh; Furlan, John M.; Pagalthivarthi, Krishnan V.; Visintainer, Robert J.; Wildey, Tim; Wang, Yan",10.1016/j.wear.2018.12.081,journalArticle,B96MJW72,2019,,1
Algorithmic Aspects of Parallel Data Processing,NO,,,,"The last decade has seen a huge and growing interest in processing large data sets on large distributed clusters. This trend began with the MapReduce framework, and has been widely adopted by several other systems, including PigLatin, Hive, Scope, Dremmel, Spark and Myria to name a few. While the applications of such systems are diverse (for example, machine learning, data analytics), most involve relatively standard data processing tasks like identifying relevant data, cleaning, filtering, joining, grouping, transforming, extracting features, and evaluating results. This has generated great interest in the study of algorithms for data processing on large distributed clusters. Algorithmic Aspects of Parallel Data Processing discusses recent algorithmic developments for distributed data processing. It uses a theoretical model of parallel processing called the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which is a simplification of the BSP model where the only cost is given by the amount of communication and the number of communication rounds.

A review: Data pre-processing and data augmentation techniques,NO,,,,"This review paper provides an overview of data pre-processing in Machine learning, focusing on all types of problems while building the machine learning problems. It deals with two significant issues in the pre-processing process (i). issues with data and (ii). Steps to follow to do data analysis with its best approach. As raw data are vulnerable to noise, corruption, missing, and inconsistent data, it is necessary to perform pre-processing steps, which is done using classification, clustering, and association and many other pre-processing techniques available. Poor data can primarily affect the accuracy and lead to false prediction, so it is necessary to improve the dataset's quality. So, data pre-processing is the best way to deal with such problems. It makes the knowledge extraction from the data set much easier with cleaning, Integration, transformation, and reduction methods. The issue with Data missing and significant differences in the variety of data always exists as the information is collected through multiple sources and from a real-world application. So, the data augmentation approach generates data for machine learning models. To decrease the dependency on training data and to improve the performance of the machine learning model.

T-REx: Table Repair Explanations,NO,,,,"Data repair is a common and crucial step in many frameworks today, as applications may use data from different sources and of different levels of credibility.

To assist users in understanding the output of such data repair algorithms, we propose T-REx, a system for providing data repair explanations through Shapley values. The system is generic and not specific to a given repair algorithm or approach: it treats the algorithm as a black box. Given a specific table cell selected by the user, T-REx employs Shapley values to explain the significance of each constraint and each table cell in the repair of the cell of interest. T-REx then ranks the constraints and table cells according to their importance in the repair of this cell. This explanation allows users to understand the repair process, as well as to act based on this knowledge, to modify the most influencing constraints or the original database.

At the same time, the Dropout layer is introduced to reduce the phenomenon of data overfitting and realize the rapid identification and classification of tool wear.

Disease Risk Prediction by Using Convolutional Neural Network,NO,,,,"Data analysis plays a significant role in handling a large amount of data in the healthcare. The previous medical researches based on handling and assimilate a huge amount of hospital data instead of prediction. Due to an enormous amount of data growth in the biomedical and healthcare field the accurate analysis of medical data becomes propitious for earlier detection of disease and patient care. However, the accuracy decreases when the medical data is partially missing. To overcome the problem of missing medical data, we perform data cleaning and imputation to transform the incomplete data to complete data. We are working on heart disease prediction on the basis of the dataset with help of Naive bayes and KNN algorithm. To extend this work, we propose the disease risk prediction using structured data.

The tensor Tucker decomposition is used to compress the data and reduce the data dimension. Based on the neural network structure, the data cleaning model is constructed.

Machine learning application for oil rate prediction in artificial gas lift wells,NO,,,,"Well production rate is one of the most critical parameters for reservoir/production engineers to evaluate performance of the system. Given this importance, however, monitoring of production rates is not usually carried out in real time. Some cases flowmeters are used which are known to carry their own inherent uncertainties. The industry, thus, relies on the use of correlations to allocate production to wells. Over time, it has been realized that the generally used correlations are not effective enough due to multiple technical and economic issues. The focus of this work is to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop a correlation that can accurately predict oil rate in artificial gas lift wells. The reason for using these algorithms is to provide a solution that is simple, easy to use and universally applicable. Various intelligent algorithms are employed, namely; Artificial Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), along with the development of Artificial Neural Network providing a usable equation to be applied on any field, hence demystifying the black-box reputation of artificial intelligence. In addition, non-linear regression is also performed to compare the results with ML methods. Data cleansing and data-reduction were carried out on the dataset comprising of 1500 separator test points. This practice yielded in only the common wellhead parameters to be used as input for the model. All ML models were compared with the non-linear regression model and with previously derived empirical models to gauge the effectiveness of the work. The newly developed model using ANN shows that it can predict the flow-rate with 99% accuracy. This is an interesting outcome, as such accuracy has not been reported in literature usually. The results of this study show that the correlation developed using ANN outperforms all the current empirical correlations, moreover, it also performs multiple times better in comparison to previously developed AI models. In addition, this work provides a functional equation that can be used by anyone on their field data, thereby removing any ambiguities or confusion related to the concept of artificial intelligence expertise and software. This effort puts forth an industrial insight into the role of data-driven computational models for the production reconnaissance scheme, not only to validate the well tests but also as an effective tool to reduce qualms in production provisions.  2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Khan, Mohammad Rasheed; Alnuaim, Sami; Tariq, Zeeshan; Abdulraheem, Abdulazeez",10.2118/194713-ms,conferencePaper,M74Z6R9S,2019,,1

Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning: Refining coarse annotations on single whole-slide images,Specific,,,,"Annotating cancerous regions in whole-slide images (WSIs) of pathology samples plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and machine learning algorithms development. However, generating exhaustive and accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of refining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more accurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and corrected, and all of them require a - often very large - number of training samples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning (LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are processed jointly within a MIL framework, and a deep-attention mechanism is leveraged to discriminate mislabeled instances, mitigating their impact on the predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives, even while learning from a single slide. These results demonstrate that LC-MIL is a promising, lightweight tool to provide fine-grained annotations from coarsely annotated pathology sets.  2021, CC BY-NC-ND.","Wang, Zhenzhen; Popel, Aleksander S.; Sulam, Jeremias",,journalArticle,7HK36JJT,2021,,1

An adaptive machine learning pipeline for predicting the recurrence of gastric cancer,NO,,,,"The advancement of medical science and technology has provided more methods for the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors, and the survival period of cancer patients has been significantly extended. However, many patients with malignant tumors still have recurrence and metastasis after effective treatment. Exploring the mechanism of tumor recurrence and metastasis to predict the recurrence and metastasis of cancer is a major clinical issue. At the same time, the rapid development of the Human Genome Project and gene microarray technology has enabled the activity of many genes in the patient's body to be intuitively measured through the chip. The rapid development of machine learning has contributed to the data mining and medical science of this DNA microarray technology. Therefore, this project aims at the above-mentioned problems and predicts the location and time of recurrence by analyzing a large amount of clinical data and 2enetic data. Firstly, we perform simple data cleaning and normalization processing on clinical data and genetic data; second, perform differential gene screening; next, select principal component analysis, sparse principal component analysis, nuclear principal component analysis, and multi-dimensional scaling algorithms to reduce the dimensional of the data. Finally, the genetic data uses random forest, support vector machine, linear support vector machine, guided aggregation algorithm, gradient boosting algorithm, and ensemble learning for machine learning, and then finds the best parameters and methods through grid search, and selects the appropriate model Evaluation method. The clinical data is manually selected and classified using machine learning. Finally, the results of clinical data and genetic data are combined to predict the site of recurrence. Using the above method to predict the recurrence and the location of the recurrence, a good effect was achieved.

Data cleansing mechanisms and approaches for big data analytics: a systematic study,Secondary works,,,,"With the evolution of new technologies, the production of digital data is constantly growing. It is thus necessary to develop data management strategies in order to handle the large-scale datasets. The data gathered through different sources, such as sensor networks, social media, business transactions, etc. is inherently uncertain due to noise, missing values, inconsistencies and other problems that impact the quality of big data analytics. One of the key challenges in this context is to detect and repair dirty data, i.e. data cleansing, and various techniques have been presented to solve this issue. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any comprehensive review of data cleansing techniques for big data analytics. As such, a comprehensive and systematic study on the state-of-the-art mechanisms within the scope of the big data cleansing is done in this survey. Therefore, five categories to review these mechanisms are considered, which are machine learning-based, sample-based, expert-based, rule-based, and framework-based mechanisms. A number of articles are reviewed in each category. Furthermore, this paper denotes the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen data cleansing techniques and discusses the related parameters, comparing them in terms of scalability, efficiency, accuracy, and usability. Finally, some suggestions for further work are provided to improve the big data cleansing mechanisms in the future.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Hosseinzadeh, Mehdi; Azhir, Elham; Ahmed, Omed Hassan; Ghafour, Marwan Yassin; Ahmed, Sarkar Hasan; Rahmani, Amir Masoud; Vo, Bay",10.1007/s12652-021-03590-2,journalArticle,LCWWDVXC,2021,,1

MACER: A Modular Framework for Accelerated Compilation Error Repair [arXiv],NO,,,,"Automated compilation error repair, the problem of suggesting fixes to buggy programs that fail to compile, has generated significant interest in recent years. Apart from being a tool of general convenience, automated code repair has significant pedagogical applications for novice programmers who find compiler error messages cryptic and unhelpful. Existing approaches largely solve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative learning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box application of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of training time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types. We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive discriminative learning techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair. Experiments indicate that the fine-grained approach adopted by MACER offers not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student. MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types -- whether popular or rare. MACER offers a training time speedup of 2x over TRACER and 800x over RLAssist, and a test time speedup of 2-4x over both.","Chhatbar, D.; Ahmed, U.Z.; Kar, P.",,journalArticle,HNU35WZK,2020,,1

Short-Termwind characteristics forecasting using stacked lstm networks,NO,,,,"Onshore/offshore wind turbines play a vital role in addressing the increasing worldwide energy demand. Enhancing the wind power harnessing capability of turbines and extending the life expectancy of their components support further reductions in the final cost of wind energy. Data-driven techniques can complement existing physics-based approaches for complex problems such as wind farm wake modeling. In this paper, a deep learning model is developed to predict the local short-Term wind characteristics. A data pre-processing pipeline that includes data cleaning and normalizing steps is developed to generate the training dataset. Time-series forecasting models based on long-short-Term-memory (LSTM) and convLSTM are developed and trained for local short-Term wind forecasting. The model is validated through experiments on three-year data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) database. The conducted experiments showed favorable performance based on root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 test scores. The R2 values for predicting 1-minute, 30-minute, and 1 hour, wind characteristics for both LSTM and convLSTM were above 0.92. The results are in agreement with the literature. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed models for short-Term wind forecasting compared to similar ones.  2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Google Traces Analysis for Deep Machine Learning Cloud Elastic Model,NO,,,,"Data set used in machine learning must be meaningful and reasonable for them to be useful. Preparing data set to be used in machine learning is an important task to map between raw data input (cause) and output (result) relation. Google traces are dump tables that contain raw data about data center servers, workload jobs and tasks status, workload demands, data center provisioned resources and hardware reconfiguration. Machine learning considers input data set and output data set as a training learning model by relating these two correlated sets as normalized values for future use. In this work, a data cleaning and full analysis for Google data center traces have been done to be used in deep machine learning models, like conventional neural network or recurrent neural network with capability of using inline learning model. Data set are processed by re-normalizing resources capacities and workloads demands (jobs and tasks), and by removing or transforming non-Available and opaque values into useful values. A novel correlation between input and output data sets for Google traces is introduced that relates workload demands with data center resources reconfiguration, and data center resources with data center capacity. The idea is to connect between demands and provisioned resources by evaluating the cloud data center configuration sets, which allows cloud manager to provision resources by setting up the best reconfiguration in scaling cloud data center. An evaluation factor (scale factor) has been introduced to evaluate elastic provisioning resources considering resources preparation time and minimum cost.  2019 IEEE.","Daradkeh, Tariq; Agarwal, Anjali; Goel, Nishith; Kozlowski, Jim",10.1109/SmartNets48225.2019.9069765,conferencePaper,NT2JVQMU,2019,,1
Multimodal Machine Learning for Display Panel Defect Layer Identification,NO,,,,"Process control in display mass production needs defect layer identification to estimate the process that causes fault conditions, which is crucial for quality fault prediction and monitoring. Defect layer identification is a labor-intensive task that requires domain knowledge of experts to make consistent decisions over multiple datasets. Sometimes, it also requires examining multiple sources of inspection images to make the final identification. In this paper, we propose a multimodal machine learning model for defect layer identification as a classification problem from multiple sources of input images. After training two single modal models from each input source, we develop a final joint fusion model to achieve the best classification performance. This work also demonstrates how to estimate the final fusion model performance without exhaustively trying all possible combinations of single modal models. In order to integrate the approach into an industrial display manufacturing defect data analytic, we propose the data coverage model, which guarantees human-level classification performance within a certain portion of data. The data coverage model improves the robustness of the multimodal model, utilizing confident learning to make a high-confidence predictions for the particle defect layer identification and adding a filter to assess whether data samples are within the coverage based on the model's latent space density estimation. This work uses particle defects data samples in 8 different layers as a combination of TEM and STEM images from display manufacturing fabrication lines. Our experimental results show that the classification accuracy improves substantially by deploying the proposed multimodal model. The results also show that it is possible to implement the data coverage model to achieve the human expert level of defect layer classification for a portion of data to automate the task.  2021 IEEE.","Lee, Janghwan; Qu, Shuhui; Kang, Yan; Jang, Wonhyouk",10.1109/ASMC51741.2021.9435664,conferencePaper,Y3FG6JPD,2021,,1
Prediction of Protein-Protein Interaction Sites with Machine-Learning-Based Data-Cleaning and Post-Filtering Procedures,NO,,,,"Accurately predicting protein-protein interaction sites (PPIs) is currently a hot topic because it has been demonstrated to be very useful for understanding disease mechanisms and designing drugs. Machine-learning-based computational approaches have been broadly utilized and demonstrated to be useful for PPI prediction. However, directly applying traditional machine learning algorithms, which often assume that samples in different classes are balanced, often leads to poor performance because of the severe class imbalance that exists in the PPI prediction problem. In this study, we propose a novel method for improving PPI prediction performance by relieving the severity of class imbalance using a data-cleaning procedure and reducing predicted false positives with a post-filtering procedure: First, a machine-learning-based data-cleaning procedure is applied to remove those marginal targets, which may potentially have a negative effect on training a model with a clear classification boundary, from the majority samples to relieve the severity of class imbalance in the original training dataset; then, a prediction model is trained on the cleaned dataset; finally, an effective post-filtering procedure is further used to reduce potential false positive predictions. Stringent cross-validation and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method, which exhibits highly competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art sequence-based PPIs predictors and should supplement existing PPI prediction methods.","Liu, GH; Shen, HB; Yu, DJ",10.1007/s00232-015-9856-z,journalArticle,HJWSE2CE,2016,,1

A methodology for conducting efficient sanitization of HTTP training datasets,NO,,,,"The performance of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems depends on the quality of the datasets used to form normal activity profiles. Suitable datasets should include high volumes of real-life data free from attack instances. On account of this requirement, obtaining quality datasets from collected data requires a process of data sanitization that may be prohibitive if done manually, or uncertain if fully automated. In this work, we propose a sanitization approach for obtaining datasets from HTTP traces suited for training, testing, or validating anomaly-based attack detectors. Our methodology has two sequential phases. In the first phase, we clean known attacks from data using a pattern-based approach that relies on tools that detect URI-based known attacks. In the second phase, we complement the result of the first phase by conducting assisted manual labeling systematically and efficiently, setting the focus of expert examination not on the raw data (which would be millions of URIs), but on the set of words that compose the URIs. This dramatically downsizes the volume of data that requires expert discernment, making manual sanitization of large datasets feasible. We have applied our method to sanitize a trace that includes 45 million requests received by the library web server of the University of Seville. We were able to generate clean datasets in less than 84 h with only 33 h of manual supervision. We have also applied our method to some public benchmark datasets, confirming that attacks unnoticed by signature-based detectors can be discovered in a reduced time span.","Díaz-Verdejo, Jesús E.; Estepa, Antonio; Estepa, Rafael; Madinabeitia, German; Muñoz-Calle, Fco.

Predicting Hydraulic Conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners Using a Neural Network Algorithm,NO,,,,"Hydraulic conductivity tests on geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) to evaluate chemical compatibility can require months to years to reach equilibrium. There is a need for alternative methods to screen GCLs for chemical compatibility that are more expedient. In this study, a neural network machine learning (ML) algorithm was used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of Na-Bentonite (NaB) GCLs to leachate chemistry. Development of the ML predictive model (MLPM) included five steps: data collection, data cleaning and normalization, algorithm selection, parameters optimization, and model validation and evaluation. The MLPM is based on data collected from two decades of tests conducted on NaB GCLs with a broad range of leachates. Bentonite characteristics, permeant chemistry, and stress conditions are incorporated into the MLPM. Validation showed that the MLPM predicts hydraulic conductivity within one order of magnitude of the measured hydraulic conductivity in 85% of the cases.

Novel approaches to assess the quality of fertility data stored in dairy herd management software,NO,,,,"ABSTRACT Scientific journals and popular press magazines are littered with articles in which the authors use data from dairy herd management software. Almost none of such papers include data cleaning and data quality assessment in their study design despite this being a very critical step during data mining. This paper presents 2 novel data cleaning methods that permit identification of animals with good and bad data quality. The first method is a deterministic or rule-based data cleaning method. Reproduction and mutation or life-changing events such as birth and death were converted to a symbolic (alphabetical letter) representation and split into triplets (3-letter code). The triplets were manually labeled as physiologically correct, suspicious, or impossible. The deterministic data cleaning method was applied to assess the quality of data stored in dairy herd management from 26 farms enrolled in the herd health management program from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Ghent University, Belgium. In total, 150,443 triplets were created, 65.4% were labeled as correct, 17.4% as suspicious, and 17.2% as impossible. The second method, a probabilistic method, uses a machine learning algorithm (random forests) to predict the correctness of fertility and mutation events in an early stage of data cleaning. The prediction accuracy of the random forests algorithm was compared with a classical linear statistical method (penalized logistic regression), outperforming the latter substantially, with a superior receiver operating characteristic curve and a higher accuracy (89 vs. 72%). From those results, we conclude that the triplet method can be used to assess the quality of reproduction data stored in dairy herd management software and that a machine learning technique such as random forests is capable of predicting the correctness of fertility data.","Hermans, K.; Waegeman, W.; Opsomer, G.; Van Ranst, B.; De Koster, J.; Van Eetvelde, M.; Hostens, M.",10.3168/jds.2016-11896,journalArticle,TN7ITCH4,2017,,1
BNAS-v2: Memory-Efficient and Performance-Collapse-Prevented Broad Neural Architecture Search,NO,,,,"In this article, we propose BNAS-v2 to further improve the efficiency of broad neural architecture search (BNAS), which employs a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) as the search space. In BNAS, the single-path sampling-updating strategy of an overparameterized BCNN leads to terrible unfair training issue, which restricts the efficiency improvement. To mitigate the unfair training issue, we employ a continuous relaxation strategy to optimize all paths of the overparameterized BCNN simultaneously. However, continuous relaxation leads to a performance collapse issue that leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned BCNN. For that, we propose the confident learning rate (CLR) and introduce the combination of partial channel connections and edge normalization. Experimental results show that 1) BNAS-v2 delivers state-of-the-art search efficiency on both CIFAR-10 (0.05 GPU days, which is 4x faster than BNAS) and ImageNet (0.19 GPU days) with better or competitive performance; 2) the above two solutions are effectively alleviating the performance collapse issue; and 3) BNAS-v2 achieves powerful generalization ability on multiple transfer tasks, e.g., MNIST, FashionMNIST, NORB, and SVHN.

Anatomical classification of upper gastrointestinal organs under various image capture conditions using AlexNet,NO,,,,"Background: Machine learning has led to several endoscopic studies about the automated localization of digestive lesions and prediction of cancer invasion depth. Training and validation dataset collection are required for a disease in each digestive organ under a similar image capture condition; this is the first step in system development. This data cleansing task in data collection causes a great burden among experienced endoscopists. Thus, this study classified upper gastrointestinal (GI) organ images obtained via routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) into precise anatomical categories using AlexNet. Method: In total, 85,246 raw upper GI endoscopic images from 441 patients with gastric cancer were collected retrospectively. The images were manually classified into 14 categories: 0) white-light (WL) stomach with indigo carmine (IC); 1) WL esophagus with iodine; 2) narrow-band (NB) esophagus; 3) NB stomach with IC; 4) NB stomach; 5) WL duodenum; 6) WL esophagus; 7) WL stomach; 8) NB oralpharynxlarynx; 9) WL oralpharynxlarynx; 10) WL scaling paper; 11) specimens; 12) WL muscle fibers during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); and 13) others. AlexNet is a deep learning framework and was trained using 49,174 datasets and validated using 36,072 independent datasets. Results: The accuracy rates of the training and validation dataset were 0.993 and 0.965, respectively. Conclusions: A simple anatomical organ classifier using AlexNet was developed and found to be effective in data cleansing task for collection of EGD images. Moreover, it could be useful to both expert and non-expert endoscopists as well as engineers in retrospectively assessing upper GI images.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","Igarashi, Shohei; Sasaki, Yoshihiro; Mikami, Tatsuya; Sakuraba, Hirotake; Fukuda, Shinsaku",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103950,journalArticle,6X64PRAI,2020,,1

Unsupervised Representation Learning of Player Behavioral Data with Confidence Guided Masking,NO,,,,"Players of online games generate rich behavioral data during gaming. Based on these data, game developers can build a range of data science applications, such as bot detection and social recommendation, to improve the gaming experience. However, the development of such applications requires data cleansing, training sample labeling, feature engineering, and model development, which makes the use of such applications in small and medium-sized game studios still uncommon. While acquiring supervised learning data is costly, unlabeled behavioral logs are often continuously and automatically generated in games. Thus we resort to unsupervised representation learning of player behavioral data to optimize intelligent services in games. Behavioral data has many unique properties, including semantic complexity, excessive length, etc. A worth noting property within raw player behavioral data is that a lot of it is task-irrelevant. For these data characteristics, we introduce a BPE-enhanced compression method and propose a novel adaptive masking strategy called Masking by Token Confidence (MTC) for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pre-training task. MTC is designed to increase the masking probabilities of task-relevant tokens. Experiments on four downstream tasks and successful deployment in a world-renowned Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) prove the effectiveness of the MTC strategy1.  2022 ACM.","Pu, Jiashu; Lin, Jianshi; Mao, Xiaoxi; Tao, Jianrong; Shen, Xudong; Shang, Yue; Wu, Runze",10.1145/3485447.3512275,conferencePaper,GICUNXAJ,2022,,1

Model Selection for Predictive Quality in Hydraulic Testing,NO,,,,"Manufacturing companies are confronted with enormous challenges such as increasing product complexity, shorter product life cycles and growing product diversity. Politically and socially, increased demands regarding sustainability and resource consumption are streaming into the focus of companies. One solution strategy to increase the productivity of existing production systems while ensuring existing quality standards is the application of data-driven analytical methods such as machine learning. Due to the frequent changes in production conditions, the analysis of real manufacturing data is linked to sophisticated data pre-processing. Changes in production data are manifested in trends and systematic shifts over time. Data pre-processing includes rule-based data cleaning, the application of dimension reduction techniques and the identification of comparable data subsets. Within the used dataset of hydraulic valves by Bosch, the comparability of the same production conditions in the manufacturing of hydraulic valves can be identified within certain periods. Machine learning methods can process large amounts of data, unfavorable row-column ratios and discover dependencies between the input data and the specified target variable as well as evaluate the multidimensional influence of all input variables on the target variable. For use cases in manufacturing, neural networks, support vector machines and tree-based methods have so far proved to be very successful. The use of cross-process production data along the value chain of hydraulic valves is a promising approach to predict the quality characteristics of workpieces. Within this research, machine learning methods with deep and shallow structures are applied to predict the internal leakage of hydraulic valves based on geometric gauge blocks from machining, mating data from assembly and hydraulic measurement data from end-of-line testing. Moreover, the most suitable methods are selected, and accurate quality predictions are obtained.","Neunzig, Christian; Fahle, Simon; Schulz, Jürgen; Möller, Matthias; Kuhlenkötter, Bernd",10.1016/j.procir.2022.04.052,journalArticle,8BRXRHDG,2022,,1

Second, the three consecutive weeks' data are cleaned to establish 21 DTTNs based on the proposed big data processing technology. Then, multiple topology measures that characterize the complexities' day-to-day dynamic evolution of these networks are provided. Third, these measures of 21 DTTNs are calculated and subsequently explained with actual implications. They are used as a training set for modeling the BP neural network which is designed for predicting DTTN complexities evolution. Finally, the reliability of the designed BP neural network is verified by comparing with the actual data and the results obtained from ARIMA method simultaneously. Because network complexities are the basis for modeling cascading failures and conducting link prediction in complex system, this proposed research framework not only provides a novel perspective for analyzing DTTN from the level of system aggregated behavior, but can also be used to improve the DTTN management level.",Lin Zhang; Jian Lu; Jialin Zhou; Jinqing Zhu; Yunxuan Li; Qian Wan,10.1142/S0217984918500628,journalArticle,25QKG8KN,2018,,1

In each prediction model, the original wind speed data are decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue signal by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. Then the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter is used to reduce noise for high-frequency IMFs. Next the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model are combined to predict low-frequency IMFs and the noise reduction results respectively. At the end, all those forecast results are added and form a one-way result. By weighted average of two one -way results, the repairing result is calculated. The experimental results from multiple prediction cases show that this method can get more accurate results.",X. Shen; Y. Qu; S. Huang; Z. Li; K.

Sign to Speech Convolutional Neural Network-Based Filipino Sign Language Hand Gesture Recognition System,NO,,,,"Sign Language Recognition is a breakthrough for helping deaf-mute people and has been studied for many years. Unfortunately, every research has its own limitation and are still unable to be used commercially. In this study, we developed a real-Time Filipino sign language hand gesture recognition system based on Convolutional Neural Network. A manually gathered dataset consists of 237 video clips with 20 different gestures. This dataset underwent data cleaning and augmentation using image pre-processing techniques. The Inflated 3D convolutional neural network was used to train the Filipino sign language recognition model. The experiments considered retraining the pretrained model with top layers and all layers. As a result, the model retrained with all layers using imbalanced dataset was shown to be more effective and achieving accuracy up to 95% over the model retrained with top layers to classify different signs or hand gestures. Using the Rapid Application Development model, the Filipino sign language recognition application was developed and assessed its usability by the target users. With different parameters used in the evaluation, the application found to be effective and efficient.  2021 IEEE.","Jarabese, Mark Benedict D.; Marzan, Charlie S.; Boado, Jenelyn Q.; Lopez, Rushaine Rica Mae F.; Ofiana, Lady Grace B.; Pilarca, Kenneth John P.",10.1109/ISCSIC54682.2021.00036,conferencePaper,963L49L2,2021,,1
Conceptual Machine Learning Framework for Initial Data Analysis,NO,,,,"This century has witnessed the emergence of new branch of science-data science that facilitates the analysis of large amounts of data which in turn helps in taking model-based data-driven decisions. The prelude to any successful analytical model building and implementation phase is a properly conducted initial data analysis stage. IDA encompasses laborious tasks of data cleansing: missing value treatment, outlier detection, checking the veracity of data, data transformation, and thus preparing data for model building. A systematic, disciplined, and non-personalized approach to IDA reduces the probability of incorrect and inaccurate results from the model. The amount of data presented for model building today makes the IDA stage a very crucial task which cannot be manually conducted. Machine learning can be applied to analyze complex and bigger data, find patterns accurately, etc. Hence, it could also be used for data preparation prior to model building. This paper tries to reduce the ad hoc nature of IDA by providing a conceptual framework using machine learning.","Smitha Rao, M.S.; Pallavi, M.; Geetha, N.",10.1007/978-981-13-7150-9_6,conferencePaper,LZDLM33G,2019,,1
The landscape of R packages for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis,NO,,,,"The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets with a large number of heterogeneous variables leads to the increasing interest in the automation of common tasks for data analysis. The most time-consuming part of this process is the Exploratory Data Analysis, crucial for better domain understanding, data cleaning, data validation, and feature engineering. There is a growing number of libraries that attempt to automate some of the typical Exploratory Data Analysis tasks to make the search for new insights easier and faster. In this paper, we present a systematic review of existing tools for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (autoEDA). We explore the features of fifteen popular R packages to identify the parts of the analysis that can be effectively automated with the current tools and to point out new directions for further autoEDA development.

Hybrid Deep Collaborative Filtering for Job Recommendation,NO,,,,"In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in a series of areas, but there is few published work on deep learning for job recommendation. Most researchers focus on the application of traditional algorithms, most of which still use algorithms like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. In this paper, we study and improve the existing recommender algorithm based on deep learning and apply it to the field of job recommendation, hoping to solve the problems existing in traditional recommender algorithm. We collect the information of the candidate and the job from a human resources business system, then performed pre-processing operations on collected data, such as data cleaning, data transforming and data reduction, and obtain a human resources data warehouse for job recommender algorithm. In addition, we propose Hybrid Deep Collaborative Filtering (HDCF) algorithm based on Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL) algorithm. With the help of the feature extraction ability of deep learning, HDCF overcomes the shortcomings of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms when dealing with sparse data and cold-start items. Experimental results show that HDCF has better recommendation performance than traditional recommender algorithms such as Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF).","Chen, WJ; Zhang, XM; Wang, HX; Xu, HJ; IEEE",,conferencePaper,ZV8D4AJT,2017,,1

Representing Character Sequences as Sets : A simple and intuitive string encoding algorithm for NLP data cleaning,NO,,,,"Data preparation is vital in the field of machine learning, especially in natural language processing. This paper briefly describes a method of encoding character sequences, which is inspired by biological memory systems. The algorithm can be thought of as a type of artificial neural network, which is only used to store text data in a specific way, not generate predictions.To test the viability of the approach, the task of searching for words in a dictionary was used, utilizing two simple heuristic rules. The goal is to produce tools capable of cleaning texts written in any language, which uses a phonemic writing system. Texts written in two specific languages are being processed during development and experimentation, they are English and Bulgarian.User-friendliness and minimization of data obfuscation are the driving requirements. Another requirement is compatibility with other machine learning methods, since the algorithm is not intended for solving an entire NLP case from start to finish.

Big data driven lithium-ion battery modeling method based on SDAE-ELM algorithm and data pre-processing technology,NO,,,,"As one of the bottleneck technologies of electric vehicles (EVs), the battery hosts complex and hardly observable internal chemical reactions. Therefore, a precise mathematical model is crucial for the battery management system (BMS) to ensure the secure and stable operation of the battery in a multi-variable environment. First, a Cloud-based BMS (C-BMS) is established based on a database containing complete battery status information. Next, a data cleaning method based on machine learning is applied to the big data of batteries. Meanwhile, to improve the model stability under dynamic conditions, an F-divergence-based data distribution quality assessment method and a sampling-based data preprocess method is designed. Then, a lithium-ion battery temperature-dependent model is built based on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders- Extreme Learning Machine (SDAE-ELM) algorithm, and a new training method combined with data preprocessing is also proposed to improve the model accuracy. Finally, to improve reliability, a conjunction working mode between the C-BMS and the BMS in vehicles (V-BMS) is also proposed, providing as an applied case of the model. Using the battery data extracted from electric buses, the effectiveness and accuracy of the model are validated.

Data mining approach to construction productivity prediction for cutter suction dredgers,NO,,,,"Cutter suction dredgers are important equipment in the dredging engineering. However, dredging construction productivity is affected by many factors such as soil, hydrology, meteorology and underwater sundries, making it difficult to obtain accurate prediction results. This paper presents a new integrated approach for using intelligent data mining algorithms to analyze dredger monitoring data and estimate the effective productivity. Through these combination algorithms, alongside Lasso and Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), the key features affecting the productivity are filtered out from a 255-dimensional monitoring data set. The continuous mean data cleaning method is proposed according to the characteristics of the filtered data, followed by a clean-up of the feature data to increase smoothness. Four machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, K-Nearest, Naive Bayes and eXtreme Gradient Enhancement (XGBoost), are used to estimate and analyze the productivity of a cutter suction dredger and applied to actual engineering cases. The results show that the prediction accuracy of XGBoost exceeds 90%, which is better than other algorithms used. Finally, the model is compared with the predictive model trained by the characteristics that influence productivity derived from the traditional method. The results still show that the XGBoost model with features obtained from machine learning as input terms has a better prediction effect.

Making Artificial Intelligence Work for Investigative Journalism,NO,,,,"Many have envisioned the use of AI methods to find hidden patterns of public interest in large volumes of data, greatly reducing the cost of investigative journalism. But so far only a few investigative stories have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods, and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a particular story, which means that training data is not readily available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts ""newsworthy"" are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.","Stray, J",10.1080/21670811.2019.1630289,journalArticle,4N4KEVT8,2019,,1

A Machine Learning Approach to Detection of Critical Alerts from Imbalanced Multi-Appliance Threat Alert Logs,NO,,,,"The extraordinary number of alerts generated by network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can desensitize security analysts tasked with incident response. Security information and event management systems (SIEMs) perform some rudimentary automation but cannot replicate the decision-making process of a skilled analyst. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can detect patterns in data with appropriate training. In practice, the majority of the alert data comprises false alerts, and true alerts form only a small proportion. Consequently, a naive engine that classifies all security alerts into the majority class can yield a superficial high accuracy close to 100%. Without any correction for the class imbalance, the false alerts will dominate algorithmic predictions resulting in poor generalization performance. We propose a machine-learning approach to address the class imbalance problem in multi-appliance security alert data and automate the security alert analysis process performed in security operations centers (SOCs). We first used the neighborhood cleaning rule (NCR) to identify and remove ambiguous, noisy, and redundant false alerts. Then, we applied the support vector machine synthetic minority oversampling technique (SVMSMOTE) to generate synthetic training true alerts. Finally, we fit and evaluated the decision tree and random forest classifiers. In the experiments, using alert data from eight security appliances, we demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly reduce the need for manual auditing, decreasing the number of uninspected alerts and achieving a performance of 99.524% in recall.  2021 IEEE.","Ndichu, Samuel; Ban, Tao; Takahashi, Takeshi; Inoue, Daisuke",10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671956,conferencePaper,ZBEFZCQ6,2021,,1

Confident Learning-Based Domain Adaptation for Hyperspectral Image Classification,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,label,"Cross-domain hyperspectral image classification is one of the major challenges in remote sensing, especially for target domain data without labels. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in domain adaptation. However, most of them leverage unlabeled target data only from a statistical perspective but neglect the analysis at the instance level. For better statistical alignment, existing approaches employ the entire unevaluated target data in an unsupervised manner, which may introduce noise and limit the discriminability of the neural networks. In this article, we propose confident learning-based domain adaptation (CLDA) to address the problem from a new perspective of data manipulation. To this end, a novel framework is presented to combine domain adaptation with confident learning (CL), where the former reduces the interdomain discrepancy and generates pseudo-labels for the target instances, from which the latter selects high-confidence target samples. Specifically, the confident learning part evaluates the confidence of each pseudo-labeled target sample based on the assigned labels and the predicted probabilities. Then, high-confidence target samples are selected as training data to increase the discriminative capacity of the neural networks. In addition, the domain adaptation part and the confident learning part are trained alternately to progressively increase the proportion of high-confidence labels in the target domain, thus further improving the accuracy of classification. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLDA method outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.

Addressing Inaccurate Nosology in Mental Health: A Multilabel Data Cleansing Approach for Detecting Label Noise From Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data in Mood and Psychosis Disorders,NO,,,,"Background Mental health diagnostic approaches are seeking to identify biological markers to work alongside advanced machine learning approaches. It is difficult to identify a biological marker of disease when the traditional diagnostic labels themselves are not necessarily valid. Methods We worked with T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 1493 individuals comprising healthy control subjects, patients with psychosis, and their unaffected first-degree relatives. Specifically, the dataset included 176 bipolar disorder probands, 134 schizoaffective disorder probands, 240 schizophrenia probands, 362 control subjects, and 581 patient relatives. We assumed that there might be noise in the diagnostic labeling process. We detected label noise by classifying the data multiple times using a support vector machine classifier, and then we flagged those individuals in which all classifiers unanimously mislabeled those subjects. Next, we assigned a new diagnostic label to these individuals, based on the biological data (magnetic resonance imaging), using an iterative data cleansing approach. Results Simulation results showed that our method was highly accurate in identifying label noise. Both diagnostic and biotype categories showed about 65% and 63% of noisy labels, respectively, with the largest amount of relabeling occurring between the healthy control subjects and individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well as in unaffected close relatives. The extraction of imaging features highlighted regional brain changes associated with each group. Conclusions This approach represents an initial step toward developing strategies that need not assume that existing mental health diagnostic categories are always valid but rather allows us to leverage this information while also acknowledging that there are misassignments.","Rokham, Hooman; Pearlson, Godfrey; Abrol, Anees; Falakshahi, Haleh; Plis, Sergey; Calhoun, Vince D.",10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.05.008,journalArticle,F8H63L9R,2020,,1
End-to-End Automated Machine Learning System for Supervised Learning Problems,NO,,,,"Automated machine learning (AutoML) represents one of the fastest-growing fields in both industry and academia. Its popularity has increased over the last few years due to the rising demand for machine learning systems usable by non-experts. Existing open-source systems fail to fully automate the machine learning tasks, being more like a black box that generates non-reusable pipelines. We propose an end-to-end system accessible to non-specialists and data scientists who wish to effortlessly create reusable and easy to understand pipelines for any regression and classification problems. The proposed solution increases the automation level by performing an advanced data cleaning followed by a complete feature engineering process without any domain knowledge about the data set. These processes are integrated into a search that generates for each model the optimum instance of preprocessed data. Bayesian optimization (BO) with a Gaussian process (GP) maximizes the performance of these models that will be ensembled using standard and probability-based stacking. We prove that the system performs better than 43.47% of practitioners on real-world data sets, being robust to any variation of tabular data. The true potential is revealed by surpassing at least one similar tool in 50% of performed benchmarks.

ML-based Telegram bot for real estate price prediction,NO,,,,"Telegram chatbots are one of the main sections in Telegram applications that get more attention and provide huge business opportunities for companies nowadays. Also, Machine learning algorithms have been used in numerous fields and industries and one of the main growing markets is real estate. It is already helping real estate agents to respond more quickly to clients' questions and develop landing pages that fit customers' needs. However, one of the main time-consuming stages for a real estate agent is the process of answering questions about price per location and knowing which locations clients are interested in. In order to solve these problems, we have built a telegram chatbot to answer customers of any real estate agent with the price of a real estate property based on their current Geolocation. This bot can predict the price of a real estate property using room numbers, Geolocation, and surface area in square meters. These are the inputs for machine learning algorithms to give an approximate price. The bot can predict based on the source of the data-set, for example, we have collected our data from classified ads website for real estate in Amman, Jordan. We have used python and web scraping library for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. As a result, by using Geolocation we have increased the model accuracy to 1.3X and our bot can be replicated in any markets based on the dataset. We believe our work can be taken to different markets and make real estate agent's job easy and more profitable by changing leads to potential customers thought answering their questions.","Salem, H.; Mazzara, M.",10.1088/1742-6596/1694/1/012010,conferencePaper,6YNKNKXK,2020,,1

Detection of Anomalies in a Time Series Data using InfluxDB and Python,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Analysis of water and environmental data is an important aspect of many intelligent water and environmental system applications where inference from such analysis plays a significant role in decision making. Quite often these data that are collected through sensible sensors can be anomalous due to different reasons such as systems breakdown, malfunctioning of sensor detectors, and more. Regardless of their root causes, such data severely affect the results of the subsequent analysis. This paper demonstrates data cleaning and preparation for time-series data and further proposes cost-sensitive machine learning algorithms as a solution to detect anomalous data points in a time-series data. The following models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines have been modified to support the cost-sensitive learning which penalizes misclassified samples thereby minimizing the total misclassification cost. Our results showed that Random Forest outperformed the rest of the models at predicting the positive class (i.e anomalies). Applying predictive model improvement techniques like data oversampling seem to provide little or no improvement to the Random Forest model. Interestingly, with recursive feature elimination we achieved a better model performance thereby reducing the dimensions in the data. Finally, with Influxdb and Kapacitor the data was ingested and streamed to generate new data points to further evaluate the model performance on unseen data, this will allow for early recognition of undesirable changes in the drinking water quality and will enable the water supply companies to rectify on a timely basis whatever undesirable changes abound.  2020, CC BY.","John, Anih T.; Amadi, Bede Chika; Umeokpala, Festus Chima",,journalArticle,JRS4I99U,2020,aug,1

A systematic review of big data-based urban sustainability research: State-of-the-science and future directions,NO,,,,"The future of humanity depends increasingly on the performance of cities. Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.","Kong, Lingqiang; Liu, Zhifeng; Wu, Jianguo",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123142,journalArticle,L24WP4PW,2020,,1
Prediction of environment variables in precision agriculture using a sparse model as data fusion strategy,NO,,,,"Precision agriculture seeks to optimize production processes by monitoring and analyzing environmental variables. For example, establishing farming actions on the crop requires analyzing variables such as temperature, ambient humidity, soil moisture, solar irradiance, and Rainfall. Although these signals might contain valuable information, it is vital to mix up the monitored signals and analyze them as a whole to provide more accurate information than analyzing the signals separately. Unfortunately, monitoring all these variables results in high costs. Hence it is necessary to establish an appropriate method that allows the infer variables behavior without the direct measurement of all of them. This paper introduces a multi-sensor data fusion technique, based on a sparse representation, to find the most straightforward and complete linear equation to predict and understand a particular variable behavior based on other monitored environmental variables measurements. Moreover, this approach aims to provide an interpretable model that allows understanding how these variables are combined to achieve such results. The fusion strategy explained in this manuscript follows a four-step process that includes 1. data cleaning, 2. redundant variable detection, 3. dictionary generation, and 4. sparse regression. The algorithm requires a target variable and two highly correlated signals. It is essential to point out that the developed method has no restrictions to specific variables. Consequently, it is possible to replicate this method for the semiautomatic prediction of multiple critical environmental variables. As a case study, this work used the SML2010 data set of the UCI machine learning repository to predicted the humidity's derivative trend function with an error rate lower than 17% and a mean absolute error lower than 6%. The experiment results show that even though sparse model predictions might not be the most accurate compared to those of linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) since it is not a black-box model, it guarantees greater interpretability of the problem.","Mancipe-Castro, L.; Gutiérrez-Carvajal, R.E.",10.1016/j.inpa.2021.06.007,journalArticle,YML4WKMZ,2022,,1

Towards self-managing cloud storage with reinforcement learning,NO,,,,"Cloud storage services are often associated with various performance issues due to load imbalance, interference from background tasks such as data scrubbing, backfilling, recovery, and the difference in processing capabilities of heterogeneous servers in a datacenter. This has a significant impact on a broad range of applications that are characterized by massive working sets and real-time constraints. However, it is challenging and burdensome for human operators to hand-tune various control-knobs in a cloud-scale storage cluster for maintaining optimal performance under diverse workload conditions. Our study on an open-source object-based storage system, Ceph, shows that common load balancing strategies are ineffective unless they are adapted according to workload characteristics. Furthermore, positive effects of an applied strategy may not be immediately visible. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning based system adaptation technique that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks. In particular, we applied a stochastic policy gradient based reinforcement learning technique to track performance hotspots in the storage cluster, and take appropriate corrective actions to maximize future performance under a variety of complex scenarios. For this purpose, we leveraged system-level performance monitoring and commonly available control-knobs in object-based cloud storage systems. We implemented the developed techniques to build an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) system for object based storage cluster, and evaluated its performance on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed. Experiments using Cloud Object Storage Benchmark (COSBench) show that, ARM improves the average read and write response time of Ceph storage cluster by upto 50% and 33% respectively, compared to the default case. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic load rebalancing technique in terms of read and write performance of Ceph storage by 43% and 36% respectively.  2019 IEEE.","Noel, Ridwan Rashid; Mehra, Rohit; Lama, Palden",10.1109/IC2E.2019.000-9,conferencePaper,GIHGTM64,2019,,1

Predicting Duration of CKD Progression in Patients with Hypertension and Diabetes,NO,,,,"Renal failure is one of major medical diseases that is recently on the rise, especially in Thailand. In general, patients with hypertension and diabetes are at high risk of encountering this disorder. The medical cost for a large group of chronic-disease patients has been the burden not only to the local hospitals, but also the country as awhole. Without forward planning, the allocated budget may not cover the expense of increasing cases. This research aims to develop an intelligent model to predict the duration to progress kidney disease in those patients with hypertension and diabetes. As such, the predictive model can help physicians to acknowledge patients' risk and set up a plan to prolong the progression duration, perhaps by modifying their behaviors. The methodology of data mining is employed for such cause, with records of 360 patients from Phan hospital's database in Chiang Rai province between 2004 and 2014. Prior model generation, the underlying data has gone through conventional steps of data cleaning and preparation, such that the problems of incomplete and biased data are resolved. To explore the baseline of prediction performance, four classical classification techniques are exploited to create the desired model. These include decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Artificial Neural Networks. Based on 10-fold cross validation, the overall accuracy obtained with the aforementioned techniques is around 70% to 80%, with the highest of 86.7% being achieved by Artificial Neural Networks.","Khannara, W; Iam-On, N; Boongoen, T",10.1007/978-3-319-27000-5_11,conferencePaper,5NHB8SF6,2016,,1

Traffic Density Classification Using Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest Method,NO,,,,"Traffic management is done to overcome congestion due to overcrowding and overcapacity. However, this arrangement still utilizes information obtained from various entities on the road, namely the police and transportation service officers. Observation of conditions and situations on the road is still subjective, so traffic management becomes subjective. However, there are potential technologies that can be utilized to help the existing problems. With these problems and opportunities, there is in providing traffic density information that is more objective utilizing the latest technology. The development of various types of information system adaptation and the use of technology is able to provide information on a regular basis. Machine learning as a form of technology development that is being optimized, can solve the information needs typical of traffic control. In this study, a traffic density classification model was made using an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest. The application of this research is carried out in five stages, namely understanding business needs, understanding data, cleaning and preparing data, optimizing parameters and modeling, and evaluating.

Evaluating Deterioration of Tunnels Using Computational Machine Learning Algorithms,NO,,,,"Tunnels are an integrated part of the transportation infrastructure. Structural evaluation and inspection of tunnels are vital tasks to assess the deterioration of tunnels and maintain their level of service. Researchers have developed many predictive models that describe the deterioration of various infrastructure systems using data from formal inspections. However, there is a lack of research that developed predictive models of deterioration of tunnels in the US. Therefore, this paper investigated the feasibility of using various machine learning techniques to develop a computational data-driven decision support tool that predicts the deterioration of tunnels in the US. An ex ante framework for predicting the deterioration of tunnels in the US was developed. The research methodology comprised (1) collecting, cleaning, and standardizing data for tunnels in the US from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); (2) identifying the best subset of variables that allow predicting the deterioration of tunnels; (3) utilizing existing machine learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machine (SVM), to develop classification models that predict the deterioration of tunnels; (4) optimizing the accuracy of the developed models by determining the best set of hyperparameters that result in the most accurate performance; (5) comparing the performance of the developed models and selecting the best performing model to be used as a decision support tool; and (6) evaluating and validating the performance of the selected model. The results identified 18 variables that greatly affect the deterioration of tunnels, with the tunnel width having the greatest impact on the prediction of deterioration of tunnels. Results indicated that the RF algorithm reached an accuracy of 85.38%, which was the highest accuracy, compared with KNN, ANN, and SVM, which reached an accuracy of 80.12%, 56.14%, and 56.73%, respectively. In addition, the entropy criterion function with a maximum of five features and 500 estimators successfully constructed the best hyperparameters for the selected RF model. Therefore, the developed decision support tool can be used by transportation entities to estimate the overall condition of tunnels based on specific tunnel parameters with reasonable prediction accuracy. It also can aid decision makers in developing, optimizing, and prioritizing maintenance plans and allocation of funding.","Ahmed, M.O.; Khalef, R.; Ali, G.G.; El-adaway, I.H.",10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0002162,journalArticle,3DSCUY4T,2021,,1

The Classification of Chinese Sensitive Information Based on BERT-CNN,NO,,,,"The traditional classification method of Chinese sensitive information mainly relies on the frequency of the co-occurrence of sensitive words and keywords. However, it is difficult to detect the meaning and context relationship of some complex statements. In this paper, a new model is proposed to classify Chinese network sensitive information. The model, which is based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and latest pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers), is called the BERT-CNN deep learning model. Firstly, nearly 20,000 comments of corresponding videos are collected from YouTube, after data cleaning and labeling, the texts are divided into four categories to build the SLD (sensitive language detection) dataset. Finally, the word vectors from the pre-trained BERT are used as the input of the CNN model, constructing the Chinese sensitive information classifying BERT-CNN model. The result reveals that, compared with the traditional neural network model, the BERT-CNN model proposed in this paper improves the generalization ability of word embedding, and can effectively achieve the recognition and classification of the network sensitive information in short text dataset. The experimental results perform better than the classic CNN and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models.  2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Wang, Yujie; Shen, Xianjun; Yang, Yujuan",10.1007/978-981-15-5577-0_20,conferencePaper,WGCTSLKV,2020,,1

A deep sequence-to-sequence method for accurate long landing prediction based on flight data,NO,,,,"In civil aviation industry, runway overrun is a typical landing safety incident concerned by both airlines and authorities. Among various contributing factors to the runway overrun incident, long landing plays an important role. However, existing studies for long landing prediction mainly depend on classic machine learning methods and handcrafted features. As a result, they usually require much expert knowledge and provide unsatisfactory results. To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative deep sequence-to-sequence model which utilizes QAR (Quick Access Recorder) data for accurate long landing pre- diction. Specifically, to cope with the high heterogeneity of QAR dataset, a data pre-processing procedure is first proposed which includes data cleaning, interpolation and normalization steps. Second, to avoid the noises incurred by too many QAR parameters and relieve the reliance on expert experience, the GBDT (gradient boosting decision trees) model is employed to choose the most relevant parameters as features. Then a CNN-LSTM and TG-attention encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to accurately predict future aircraft ground speed and radio height sequences, based on which the touchdown distance can be finally calculated. Experimental results on a large QAR dataset with 44,176 A321 flights validate effectiveness of the proposed method. 2021 The Authors.

A hierarchical machine learning classification approach for secondary task identification from observed driving behavior data,NO,,,,"According to NHTSA, more than 3477 people (including 551 non-occupants) were killed and 391,000 were injured due to distraction-related crashes in 2015. The distracted driving epidemic has long been under research to identify its impact on driving behavior. There have been a few attempts to detect drivers engagement in secondary tasks from observed driving behavior. Yet, to the authors knowledge, not much effort has been directed to identify the types of secondary tasks from driving behavior parameters. This study proposes a bi-level hierarchical classification methodology using machine learning to identify the different types of secondary tasks drivers are engaged in using their driving behavior parameters. At the first level, drivers engagement in secondary tasks is detected, while at the second level, the distinct types of secondary tasks are identified. Comparative evaluation is performed between nine ensemble tree classification methods to identify three types of secondary tasks (hand-held cellphone calling, cellphone texting, and interaction with an adjacent passenger). The inputs to the models are five driving behavior parameters (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, pedal position, and yaw rate) along with their standard deviations. The results showed that the overall secondary task detection accuracy ranged from 66% to 96%, except for the Decision Tree that was able to detect engagement in secondary tasks with a high accuracy of 99.8%. For the identification of secondary tasks types, the overall accuracy ranged from 55% to 79%, with the highest accuracy of 82.2% achieved by the Random Forest method. The findings of the paper show the proposed methodology promising to (1) characterize drivers engagement in unlawful secondary tasks (such as texting) as a counter measure to prevent crashes, and (2) alert drivers to pay attention back to the main driving task when risky changes to their driving behavior take place.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","Osman, Osama A.; Hajij, Mustafa; Karbalaieali, Sogand; Ishak, Sherif",10.1016/j.aap.2018.12.005,journalArticle,ZIZG7V66,2019,,1

"Exploring Customers' Behavior - Analysing Customer Data, Customer Segmentation and Predicting Customers' Behavior on Black Friday",NO,,,,"Due to massive expansion of trading businesses, especially e-commerces, it is necessary for companies to compete for their status among customers. As most of the customers value customer experience and claim that customer experience is the most important parameter when it comes to their decision making, in this work we focus on exploring those claims using ""Black Friday"" dataset. The aim of this study is to perform customer segmentation and suggest a strategy based on customers' analysis and division, and to propose an optimal model for predicting customers' behavior. Data mining and machine learning techniques were used to perform analysis, clustering, and model building. At first, data cleaning and preprocessing was done, followed by an extensive analysis of data. Then, K-means clustering algorithm was used to perform segmentation. Finally, three different models were built with a goal of predicting customers' purchase behavior (in this case purchase value). After comparing the results of the models, it was concluded that Random Forest Regressor performed the best. In this paper we discuss results that we got, compare them to the previous studies and draw conclusions that might be useful for marketers and decision makers, as they can be the base for their new strategies.

On the importance of building high-quality training datasets for neural code search,NO,,,,"The performance of neural code search is significantly influenced by the quality of the training data from which the neural models are derived. A large corpus of high-quality query and code pairs is demanded to establish a precise mapping from the natural language to the programming language. Due to the limited availability, most widely-used code search datasets are established with compromise, such as using code comments as a replacement of queries. Our empirical study on a famous code search dataset reveals that over one-third of its queries contain noises that make them deviate from natural user queries. Models trained through noisy data are faced with severe performance degradation when applied in real-world scenarios. To improve the dataset quality and make the queries of its samples semantically identical to real user queries is critical for the practical usability of neural code search. In this paper, we propose a data cleaning framework consisting of two subsequent filters: a rule-based syntactic filter and a model-based semantic filter. This is the first framework that applies semantic query cleaning to code search datasets. Experimentally, we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework on two widely-used code search models and three manually-annotated code retrieval benchmarks. Training the popular DeepCS model with the filtered dataset from our framework improves its performance by 19.2% MRR and 21.3% Answer@1, on average with the three validation benchmarks.  2022, CC BY.","Sun, Zhensu; Li, Li; Liu, Yan; Du, Xiaoning; Li, Li",,journalArticle,GAUCSV7K,2022,,1

A number of approaches have already been investigated in order to provide solution in views of operationally reaching this still challenging problem. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive and structured overview of existing contributions in the literature. For this purpose, a taxonomy is proposed to categorize the whole set of automatic and semi-automatic methods addressing MBES data cleaning. The non-supervised algorithms that compose the majority of the methods developed in the hydrographic field, are mainly described according to both the features of the bathymetric data and the type of outliers to detect.

Improvement of training set structure in fusion data cleaning using Time-Domain Global Similarity method,Specific,,,,"Traditional data cleaning identifies dirty data by classifying original data sequences, which is a class-imbalanced problem since the proportion of incorrect data is much less than the proportion of correct ones for most diagnostic systems in Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices. When using machine learning algorithms to classify diagnostic data based on class-imbalanced training set, most classifiers are biased towards the major class and show very poor classification rates on the minor class. By transforming the direct classification problem about original data sequences into a classification problem about the physical similarity between data sequences, the class-balanced effect of Time-Domain Global Similarity (TDGS) method on training set structure is investigated in this paper. Meanwhile, the impact of improved training set structure on data cleaning performance of TDGS method is demonstrated with an application example in EAST POlarimetry-INTerferometry (POINT) system.  2017 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.","Liu, J.; Lan, T.; Qin, H.",10.1088/1748-0221/12/10/C10004,journalArticle,G6JPD9HH,2017,,1

PClean: Bayesian Data Cleaning at Scale with Domain-Specific Probabilistic Programming [arXiv],YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Data cleaning is naturally framed as probabilistic inference in a generative model, combining a prior distribution over ground-truth databases with a likelihood that models the noisy channel by which the data are filtered, corrupted, and joined to yield incomplete, dirty, and denormalized datasets. Based on this view, we present PClean, a unified generative modeling architecture for cleaning and normalizing dirty data in diverse domains. Given an unclean dataset and a probabilistic program encoding relevant domain knowledge, PClean learns a structured representation of the data as a relational database of interrelated objects, and uses this latent structure to impute missing values, identify duplicates, detect errors, and propose corrections in the original data table. PClean makes three modeling and inference contributions: (i) a domain-general non-parametric generative model of relational data, for inferring latent objects and their network of latent connections; (ii) a domain-specific probabilistic programming language, for encoding domain knowledge specific to each dataset being cleaned; and (iii) a domain-general inference engine that adapts to each PClean program by constructing data-driven proposals used in sequential Monte Carlo and particle Gibbs. We show empirically that short ( 50-line) PClean programs deliver higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data cleaning systems based on machine learning and weighted logic; that PClean's inference algorithm is faster than generic particle Gibbs inference for probabilistic programs; and that PClean scales to large real-world datasets with millions of rows.","Lew, A.K.; Agrawal, M.; Sontag, D.; Mansinghka, V.K.",,journalArticle,JK5DEQE2,2020,aug,1
Activities of Daily Living and Environment Recognition Using Mobile Devices: A Comparative Study,NO,,,,"The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) using the sensors available in off-the-shelf mobile devices with high accuracy is significant for the development of their framework.

However, the results may be improved with the implementation of other methods. Similar to the initial proposal of the framework, this paper proposes the recognition of eight ADL, e.g., walking, running, standing, going upstairs, going downstairs, driving, sleeping, and watching television, and nine environments, e.g., bar, hall, kitchen, library, street, bedroom, living room, gym, and classroom, but using the Instance Based k-nearest neighbour (IBk) and AdaBoost methods as well.

Data-Driven Prediction and Optimization of Energy Use for Transit Fleets of Electric and ICE Vehicles,NO,,,,"Due to the high upfront cost of electric vehicles, many public transit agencies can afford only mixed fleets of internal combustion and electric vehicles. Optimizing the operation of such mixed fleets is challenging because it requires accurate trip-level predictions of electricity and fuel use as well as efficient algorithms for assigning vehicles to transit routes. We present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of trip-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets and for the optimization of vehicle assignments, which we evaluate using data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN. We first introduce a data collection, storage, and processing framework for system-level and high-frequency vehicle-level transit data, including domain-specific data cleansing methods. We train and evaluate machine learning models for energy prediction, demonstrating that deep neural networks attain the highest accuracy. Based on these predictions, we formulate the problem of minimizing energy use through assigning vehicles to fixed-route transit trips. We propose an optimal integer program as well as efficient heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, demonstrating the scalability and performance of these algorithms numerically using the transit network of CARTA.  2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Clustering-based self-imputation of unlabeled fault data in a fleet of photovoltaic generation systems,Specific,,,,"This work proposes a fault detection and imputation scheme for a fleet of small-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems, where the captured data includes unlabeled faults. On-site meteorological information, such as solar irradiance, is helpful for monitoring PV systems. However, collecting this type of weather data at every station is not feasible for a fleet owing to the limitation of installation costs. In this study, to monitor a PV fleet efficiently, neighboring PV generation profiles were utilized for fault detection and imputation, as well as solar irradiance. For fault detection from unlabeled raw PV data, K-means clustering was employed to detect abnormal patterns based on customized input features, which were extracted from the fleet PVs and weather data. When a profile was determined to have an abnormal pattern, imputation for the corresponding data was implemented using the subset of neighboring PV data clustered as normal. For evaluation, the effectiveness of neighboring PV information was investigated using the actual rooftop PV power generation data measured at several locations in the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) campus. The results indicate that neighboring PV profiles improve the fault detection capability and the imputation accuracy. For fault detection, clustering-based schemes provided error rates of 0.0126 and 0.0223, respectively, with and without neighboring PV data, whereas the conventional prediction-based approach showed an error rate of 0.0753. For imputation, estimation accuracy was significantly improved by leveraging the labels of fault detection in the proposed scheme, as much as 18.32% reduction in normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) compared with the conventional scheme without fault consideration.  2020 by the authors.","Park, Sunme; Park, Soyeong; Kim, Myungsun; Hwang, Euiseok",10.3390/en13030737,journalArticle,SL2YKXD6,2020,,1

A Novel FCM and DT based Segmentation and Profiling Approach for Customer Relationship Management,NO,,,,"In the current era of e-businesses, customer relationship management is a decisive process for selecting profitable customers and enhancing customer relationships for the betterment of the organization. However, most customer-oriented organizations face a common problem of categorizing customers, understanding the difference between them, and extracting profitable customers. In this paper, we present an approach to address these issues identifying the future and current values of customers. This helps in identifying and retaining the customers that a firm can most profitably serve. In our proposed system, we purify data through pre-processing and data cleaning, and then three key parameters i.e. recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) are extracted from data. A Analytical Hierarchical Process is then applied to calculate the weights of RFM. These weighted RFM parameters are used for categorization of customers with the help of a fuzzy-c-mean algorithm. The validity of clusters is checked with Davies-Bouldin Index and finally, classification is done using decision tree and recommendation is given to enhance customer relationships. We evaluated the performance of our proposed system on two publicly available KDD Cup and Instacart datasets and achieved an accuracy rate of 95.5% and 94.3% respectively.

Attack Detection for Wireless Enterprise Network: A Machine Learning Approach,NO,,,,"An increasing number of enterprises are adopting wireless technology to deploy networks. However, wireless enterprise networks are more vulnerable than wired networks because of the broadcast feature. Thus, illegal attacks such as data theft and information forgery seriously threaten the property and information security of users and enterprises; these phenomena are attracting increasing attention from both academia and industry. Additionally, effectively detecting the attacks in the wireless enterprise networks is one of todays most important and challenging problems, especially in Wi-Fi networks, as attacks become increasingly covert and diverse. Fortunately, WiFi networks produce large amounts of data, providing copious big data for researchers. In this paper, using the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID), which is derived from the real-world Wi-Fi network, we introduce machine learning to detect network attacks. To significantly increase the training and convergence speeds, we deploy two-dimensional data cleaning and select 18 useful attributes from the original set of 154. Then, we introduce support vector machine (SVM) to detect attacks based on the cleaned dataset. The detection accuracy for flooding attacks, injection attacks, and normal data reached 89.18%, 87.34%, and 99.88% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a two-dimensional data cleaning method with an SVM to improve the detection accuracy for attacks. Finally, our detection results are comparable with the existing studies; however, our method operates with simpler data attributes with faster and more efficient training speed.  2018 IEEE.","Qin, Yinuo; Li, Bo; Yang, Mao; Yan, Zhongjiang",10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567797,conferencePaper,M8VT3UC2,2018,,1

Automatic Twitter Crime Prediction Using Hybrid Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network with World Cup Optimization,NO,,,,"Social media are digitally mediated platforms that allow people to create and exchange content, professional interests, ideas, and other forms of expression through virtual networks. Users often utilize web-based programs on their PCs and laptops to visit social media sites, or they download programs that provide their devices social media capabilities.

"Towards Tabular Embeddings, Training the Relational Models",NO,,,,"Correctly identifying the semantic label of a table column (e.g. artist ) or the domain of a tuple (e.g. Song) is crucial for data science tasks, such as schema matching, data cleaning and discovery. Existing data preparation and integration systems are known to make mistakes that need to be corrected by humans, which is labor-intensive and expensive especially at scale [19], [20], [25], [9], [8]. The accuracy is also known to suffer on dirty data. In this paper we define and evaluate tabular embeddings to help increase the accuracy.Embeddings, is a well-known dimensionality reduction technique, usually applied to represent (one-dimensional) text documents/sentences as vectors for further analytics [28], [7], [23]. Using embeddings lowers dimensionality, as well as the models trained with embeddings often exhibit higher accuracy, compared to the same trained without such, because the embeddings vectors store the context information. Our 2-dimensional embeddings are more suitable for tables rather than text. We justify their efficiency on fundamental tasks on tables such as classifying columns and tuples.We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and compare the Neural Network trained with tabular embeddings against the same trained without such embeddings. We report significant accuracy gains in tuple classification when using the Neural Network trained with our tabular embeddings - up to 17.6% delta in F-measure for Songs compared with the same without our embeddings. For training and evaluating all our embeddings and models, we use a large-scale WebTables dataset having 15 million tables coming from  248K English Web sources [12].","Khan, R.; Gubanov, M.",10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377769,conferencePaper,JLKSLH2X,2020,,1

DWreck: a Data Wrecker Framework for Generating Unclean Datasets,NO,,,,"In this paper, we present DWreck, a data wrecker framework for generating unclean datasets by counterproductively applying different data quality dimensions. In a typical data-analysis pipeline, data cleaning is the most cost-intensive, laborious, and time-consuming step. Unclean dataset or partially cleaned dataset can lead to incorrect training of machine learning models and result in wrong conclusions. Generally, data-scientists examine null, missing, or duplicate values, and the dataset is cleaned by removing the entire record or imputing the values. However, deleting the records, or imputing the values cannot be termed as comprehensive cleaning, as these cleaning techniques may result in a reduction in the population of data, and increased error in estimation due to biased values. For systematically cleaning an unclean dataset, it is necessary to comply with the data quality dimensions such as completeness, validity, consistency, accuracy, and conformity. The errors described as violations of expectations for completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency and other dimensions of data quality often impede the successful completion of information processing streams and consequently degrade the dependent business processes. Therefore, educating a data-scientist for comprehensively cleaning a raw-dataset acquired for analysis is an incremental learning process. Moreover, for extensive training on cleaning a dataset on different quality dimensions, it is necessary to provide a variety of datasets that are unclean on various data quality dimensions. Hence, in this paper, we present DWreck, a data wrecker framework for generating unclean datasets by counterproductively applying different data quality dimensions. The DWreck framework is designed on the principles of microservices architecture pattern. For allowing function-specific extensibility, the DWreck comprises four groups of microservices: (a) Dataset Profiling, (b) Data type Processing, (c) Counterproductive Dimensions, and (d) Miscellaneous. The orchestrator coordinates the different microservices in a complex workflow that is further split into three sub-workflows to generate an unclean (wrecked) dataset as an output. Finally, we evaluate the DWreck framework on twenty seed-datasets to generate corresponding wrecked datasets.","Chouhan, A.; Prabhune, A.; Prabhuraj, P.; Chaudhari, H.",10.1109/BigDataService49289.2020.00020,conferencePaper,WG7TGG4D,2020,,1

A Verifiable Imputation Analysis for Univariate Time Series and Enabling Package,NO,,,,"This paper proposes a verifiable imputation process and an enabling tool for univariate time series. Common ad-hoc and case-specific imputation are not enough to ensure high quality and effective imputation. We adopt the similar verification logic of supervised learning. We use artificial missing sampling as the test set to estimate a set of imputers' performances and use the estimated performances to select the best imputer. To ensure the correctness of selection, we analyze the impact of various factors on estimation accuracy. Those factors are missing rate, size of artificial missing data and patterns, selected imputers, and noise level. We propose a two-step verifiable imputation process to integrate all of the steps. With this process, we can always leverage the most suitable imputer to achieve a high quality of imputation without tedious and error-prone data cleaning efforts. We implement the tool as a Python package, with many imputers with their unique capabilities and a API. We automate the imputation through a standard process, which returns imputed results and detailed rationales of selection along with quality metrics.  2020 IEEE.","Zhou, Nianjun; Patel, Dhaval; Iyengar, Arun; Shrivastava, Shrey; Bhamidipaty, Anuradha",10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377909,conferencePaper,UDFPKUJ4,2020,,1

A Travel Mode Identification Framework Based on Cellular Signaling Data,NO,,,,"The rapid development of telecommunication network has produced a large amount of spatial-temporal information of mobile phone users. GPS data are typically collected by smartphones apps, which are restricted to small samples of the population. Cellular signaling data (CSD) are usually collected by mobile network operators, which enables researchers to conduct travel behavior analysis of the entire population at a relatively low cost compared to GPS. However, extracting travel mode information from CSD is particularly challenging due to the noise data and low positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a travel mode identification framework based on CSD, which includes data cleansing and travel mode identification. In terms of data cleansing, oscillation sequence and drift data are mainly cleansed. For the oscillation sequence, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on time window. For the drift data, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on distance, velocity and frequency. In terms of travel mode identification, the task is divided into two dichotomous problems: motor and non-motor transport identification and public and private transport identification. Each dichotomous problem proposes an algorithm that does not rely on the ground truth dataset for model training. Finally, a ground truth dataset is constructed to verify all algorithms. The result shows that, in terms of data cleansing, the similarity between CSD after cleansing and the actual trajectory according to DTW improved by 101.13% on average. In terms of travel mode identification, the proposed method can achieve similar or even better accuracy than traditional supervised-learning algorithms (94% in motor and non-motor transport identification, 83.5% in public and private transport identification), which can be directly applied to large-scale population analysis scenarios.  2022 Jiatao Chen et al.","Chen, Jiatao; Xiong, Chen; Cai, Ming",10.1155/2022/2113213,journalArticle,TJ6H3LVC,2022,,1

Automatic Changes Detection between Outdated Building Maps and New VHR Images Based on Pre-Trained Fully Convolutional Feature Maps,NO,,,,"Detecting changes between the existing building basemaps and newly acquired high spatial resolution remotely sensed (HRS) images is a time-consuming task. This is mainly because of the data labeling and poor performance of hand-crafted features. In this paper, for efficient feature extraction, we propose a fully convolutional feature extractor that is reconstructed from the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and pre-trained on the Pascal VOC dataset. Our proposed method extract pixel-wise features, and choose salient features based on a random forest (RF) algorithm using the existing basemaps. A data cleaning method through cross-validation and label-uncertainty estimation is also proposed to select potential correct labels and use them for training an RF classifier to extract the building from new HRS images. The pixel-wise initial classification results are refined based on a superpixel-based graph cuts algorithm and compared to the existing building basemaps to obtain the change map. Experiments with two simulated and three real datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method and indicate high accuracy and low false alarm rate.","Zhang, YS; Zhu, YC; Li, HF; Chen, SY; Peng, J; Zhao, L",10.3390/s20195538,journalArticle,EXB8GNZ6,2020,,1

Finally, a chip appearance defect classification model based on a convolutional neural network is constructed.

Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 through Lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI),NO,,,,"This paper provides preliminary discourse on buzz words about Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. This discourse focuses on the lens of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Machine Learning of Artificial Intelligence (MLAI). To some extent several companies have embarked Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 within Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Through the wave of IoT Technology, Industries are adopting automated machinery. Predictive maintenance (PM) is indispensable not only toward the machinesrdquo vitality and longevity purpose, but also toward the human error reduction. This paper elaborates its discourse of Industry 4.0 and Society through the lens of CBM and MLAI. The mentioned Machine Learning, in this paper, refers to research methodology, as methodological frameworks. Those frameworks comprise several phases, which are: 1. Equipment Analysis; 2. Data Evaluation; 3. Data Selection and Process; 4. Modeling; 5. Decision Support Model Evaluation. The MLAI techniques are based upon the identification of behaviour patterns. This identification comprises datasets that exclude mathematical models or prior historical knowledge. The discourse in this paper intertwines CBM process and MLAI through data cleaning and processing, features stratification and extraction, model stratification and validation. This paper elaborates two renowned maintenance approaches which are preventive and corrective maintenance. Discourse in this paper focuses on corrective action, known as predictive maintenance (PM), or condition based maintenance (CBM) within Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). CBM is chosen as the most desirable strategy, as it involves the intervention as the consequence of the machine breakdown. It also provides cost savings toward spare parts consumption, and optimizes production.","Rahman, A.; Pasaribu, E.; Nugraha, Y.; Khair, F.; Soebandrija, K.E.N.; Wijaya, D.I.",10.1088/1757-899X/852/1/012022,conferencePaper,TU8L68VI,2020,,1

Relational pretrained transformers towards democratizing data preparation [Vision] [arXiv],YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,features,"Can AI help automate human-easy but computer-hard data preparation tasks (for example, data cleaning, data integration, and information extraction), which currently heavily involve data scientists, practitioners, and crowd workers? We envision that human-easy data preparation for relational data can be automated. To this end, we first identify the desiderata for computers to achieve near-human intelligence for data preparation: computers need a deep-learning architecture (or model) that can read and understand millions of tables; computers require unsupervised learning to perform self-learning without labeled data, and can gain knowledge from existing tasks and previous experience; and computers desire few-shot learn-ing that can adjust to new tasks with a few examples. Our proposal is called Relational Pretrained Transformers (RPTs), a general framework for various data preparation tasks, which typically consists of the following models/methods: (1) transformer, a general and powerful deep-learning model, that can read tables/texts/images;(2) masked language model for self-learning and collaborative train-ing for transferring knowledge and experience; and (3) pattern-exploiting training that better interprets a task from a few examples.We further present concrete RPT architectures for three classical data preparation tasks, namely data cleaning, entity resolution, and information extraction. We demonstrate RPTs with some initial yet promising results. Last but not least, we identify activities that will unleash a series of research opportunities to push forward the field of data preparation.","Nan Tang; Ju Fan; Fangyi Li; Jianhong Tu; Xiaoyong Du; Guoliang Li; Madden, S.; Ouzzani, M.",,journalArticle,2BJUGGQV,2020,aug,1
Outlier detection for questionnaire data in biobanks,NO,,,,"Background Biobanks increasingly collect, process and store omics with more conventional epidemiologic information necessitating considerable effort in data cleaning. An efficient outlier detection method that reduces manual labour is highly desirable. Method We develop an unsupervised machine-learning method for outlier detection, namely kurPCA, that uses principal component analysis combined with kurtosis to ascertain the existence of outliers. In addition, we propose a novel regression adjustment approach to improve detection, namely the regression adjustment for data by systematic missing patterns (RAMP). Result Application to epidemiological record data in a large-scale biobank (Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Japan) shows that a combination of kurPCA and RAMP effectively detects known errors or inconsistent patterns. Conclusions We confirm through the results of the simulation and the application that our methods showed good performance. The proposed methods are useful for many practical analysis scenarios.","Sakurai, R; Ueki, M; Makino, S; Hozawa, A; Kuriyama, S; Takai-Igarashi, T; Kinoshita, K; Yamamoto, M; Tamiya, G",10.1093/ije/dyz012,journalArticle,AJGUJ343,2019,,1
Improving the Accuracy of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Subtype Classification by Hidden Class Detection via Label Smoothing,NO,,,,"Obtaining ground-truth labels for supervised training is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Owning to their large size, only slide-level labels or a handful of coarse annotations are usually provided for pathology images, which makes the training of the classifier challenging. In this study, we propose a conceptually simple, two-stage approach to classify small and large duct types in intrahepatic chalongio-carcinoma using only slide-level labels. Unlike conventional pathology image analysis methods employ multiple instance learning (MIL) applied to overcome the problem of the slide-level label, we introduce a novel label smoothing method to progressively refine the training labels to improve the classification accuracy. The main idea is that we introduce the hidden class, which is assumed to be mutually inclusive of all ground-truth classes and less confident for classification. By iteratively refining (i.e., smoothing) per-patch labels, we can extract and discard the hidden class from the training data. We demonstrate that the proposed label filtering scheme improves the classification accuracy by up to 30% compared to the baseline MIL method and 10% compared to the state-of-the-art noisy label cleaning method. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gene mutation prior information in the classification of two different duct types. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method may provide pathologists insight into the study of correlations between genetic and histologic subtypes.",J. W. Tan; K. Lee; K. Lee; W. -K.

Bioink Formulation and Machine Learning-Empowered Bioprinting Optimization,NO,,,,"Bioprinting enables the fabrication of complex, heterogeneous tissues through robotically-controlled placement of cells and biomaterials. It has been rapidly developing into a powerful and versatile tool for tissue engineering. Recent advances in bioprinting modalities and biofabrication strategies as well as new materials and chemistries have led to improved mimicry and development of physiologically relevant tissue architectures constituted with multiple cell types and heterogeneous spatial material properties. Machine learning (ML) has been applied to accelerate these processes. It is a new paradigm for bioprinting. In this review, we explore current trends in bioink formulation and how ML has been used to accelerate optimization and enable real-time error detection as well as to reduce the iterative steps necessary for bioink formulation. We examined how rheometric properties, including shear storage, loss moduli, viscosity, shear-thinning property of biomaterials affect the printability of a bioink. Furthermore, we scrutinized the interplays between yield shear stress and the printability of a bioink. Moreover, we systematically surveyed the application of ML in precision in situ surgical site bioprinting, closed-loop AI printing, and post-printing optimization.

Spectrum Reconstruction via Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Satellite Communication Systems,NO,,,,"Satellite based spectrum sensing is studied for a system consisting of multiple satellites and a gateway (GW), where these satellites perform spectrum sensing and send mass spectrum-sensing data to the GW. To address the challenges of mass spectrum-sensing data and limited transmission capacity of the links from spectrum-sensing satellites to the GW, we propose a method called joint anomalous data repairing and deep convolutional neural network based spectrum reconstruction (ADRD-SR), which can reconstruct the original spectrum-sensing data from the incomplete data. Specifically, the GW preprocesses the incomplete data using the anomalous data repairing algorithm. A deep convolutional neural network is constructed and well trained, then it is activated to reconstruct the preprocessed spectrum data. Additionally, to sustain good reconstruction performance by tracing the dynamical spectrum-sensing data, we design a real-time evaluation oriented spectrum reconstruction framework, through seeking the events when the mean absolute error (MAE) becomes larger than a predefined threshold. Furthermore, the ADRD-SR method can reduce the MAE by more than 68% over the conventional reconstruction methods. Moreover, the reconstructed spectrum data can be used to assist spectrum sensing, and the corresponding probability of correct detection is only degraded by 5% even when 75% of the data is discarded.",X.

FairPrep: Promoting data to a first-class citizen in studies on fairness-enhancing interventions,related,,,,"The importance of incorporating ethics and legal compliance into machine-assisted decision-making is broadly recognized. Further, several lines of recent work have argued that critical opportunities for improving data quality and representativeness, controlling for bias, and allowing humans to oversee and impact computational processes are missed if we do not consider the lifecycle stages upstream from model training and deployment. Yet, very little has been done to date to provide system-level support to data scientists who wish to develop and deploy responsible machine learning methods. We aim to fill this gap and present FairPrep, a design and evaluation framework for fairness-enhancing interventions. FairPrep is based on a developer-centered design, and helps data scientists follow best practices in software engineering and machine learning. As part of our contribution, we identify shortcomings in existing empirical studies for analyzing fairness-enhancing interventions. We then show how FairPrep can be used to measure the impact of sound best practices, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling. In particular, our results suggest that the high variability of the outcomes of fairness-enhancing interventions observed in previous studies is often an artifact of a lack of hyperparameter tuning. Further, we show that the choice of a data cleaning method can impact the effectiveness of fairness-enhancing interventions. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Robust Class-Specific Autoencoder for Data Cleaning and Classification in the Presence of Label Noise,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",?,label,"We present a simple but effective method for data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise. The fundamental idea is to treat the data points with label noise as outliers of the class indicated by the corresponding noisy label. This essentially allows us to deal with the traditional supervised problem of classification with label noise as an unsupervised one, i.e., identifying outliers from each class. However, finding such dubious observations (outliers) from each class is challenging in general. We therefore propose to reduce their potential influence using class-specific feature learning by autoencoder. Particularly, we learn for each class a feature space using all the samples labeled as that class, including those with noisy (but unknown to us) labels. Furthermore, in order to solve the situation when the noise is relatively high, we propose a weighted class-specific autoencoder by considering the effect of each data point on the postulated model. To fully exploit the advantage of the learned class-specific feature space, we use a minimum reconstruction error based method for finding out the outliers (label noise) and solving the classification task. Experiments on several datasets show that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance on the task of data cleaning and classification with noisy labels.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Zhang, Weining; Wang, Dong; Tan, Xiaoyang",10.1007/s11063-018-9963-9,journalArticle,UNDWQ5H2,2019,aug,1
Prediction into the future: A novel intelligent approach for PM2.5 forecasting in the ambient air of open-pit mining,NO,,,,"PM2.5 is a major pollutant in the ambient air of open-pit mining, whose accurate prediction is significant for its removal and control design. In this study, a hybrid method was proposed for analyzing PM2.5 concentration. A field measurement of PM2.5 concentration was conducted at an operating open-pit mine in northern China. The data was cleaned to remove the outliers in the PM2.5 results. Gradient boosting machine (GBM) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used for the regression and classification analysis. In terms of regression, different scenarios were designed to evaluate the effect of time interval for future predictions (5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 40 min, 1 h, and 2 h ahead) on the performance. The classification of PM2.5 concentration into ‘severe’ and ‘not severe’ was also analysed. The results are as follows: (i) A total of 37 data instances were detected to be outliers, and the regression performance was improved after data cleaning (from 0.902 to 0.937 on the training set and from 0.877 to 0.940 on the testing set). (ii) The percentage of training set percentage was determined to be 70%, and PSO performed well in optimizing the hyper-parameters of GBM, (iii) The regression was quite satisfactory with the correlation coefficient being larger than 0.9. The testing performance decreased with the increase in time interval. (iv) An average accuracy of 0.954 was achieved during the classification of PM2.5 concentration. The predicted PM2.5 concentration could work as a precursor for the heavy PM pollution around open-pit mining.","Lu, Xiang; Zhou, Wei; Qi, Chongchong; Luo, Huaiting; Zhang, Dongxu; Pham, Binh Thai",10.1016/j.apr.2021.101084,journalArticle,X743VEW5,2021,,1

Evaluating the impact of a two-stage multivariate data cleansing approach to improve to the performance of machine learning classifiers: A case study in human activity recognition,Specific,,,,"Human activity recognition (HAR) is a popular field of study. The outcomes of the projects in this area have the potential to impact on the quality of life of people with conditions such as dementia. HAR is focused primarily on applying machine learning classifiers on data from low level sensors such as accelerometers. The performance of these classifiers can be improved through an adequate training process. In order to improve the training process, multivariate outlier detection was used in order to improve the quality of data in the training set and, subsequently, performance of the classifier. The impact of the technique was evaluated with KNN and random forest (RF) classifiers. In the case of KNN, the performance of the classifier was improved from 55.9% to 63.59%.  2020 by the authors.

Disaggregated Retail Forecasting: A Gradient Boosting Approach,NO,,,,"This paper presents an investigation of the disaggregated forecast problem that is central to retail operations profitability as it supports accurate inventory decisions on point of sales: forecasting lower than customer demand results in out-of-stock events and conversely, forecasting higher than customer demand leads to overstocks and inventory losses. The complexity of the problem is related to different aspects, including the large number of stores and products of modern retailers, the complex marketing and promotional strategies that impact customer demand, and cross-product effects that are difficult to model. We propose a method that encompasses (i) data cleansing methods for improving sales information usually available for retailers, (ii) a learning algorithm that considers marketing, promotional and cross-product variables and (iii) a structural change correction method to account for disruptions in consumer behavior. Our approach is validated using a real public dataset from a large retailer (Corporacion Favorita) containing data from 54 stores and 4036 products. Our accuracy results are compared to the Base-Lift model, a widely used benchmark model for retail forecasting. Results show that our proposed approach yields improvements up to 26.72% in accuracy metrics, outperforming conventional forecasting models. The results of a simulation conducted with the aim to quantify the advantage of more accurate forecasting on inventory performance show a 45.83% reduction in stockouts and 7.51% reduction in stock on hand. Finally, it is also important to highlight that the approach itself has a high degree of automation, which is an important requirement for modern retailers.  2022, The Authors.

Enriching integrated statistical open city data by combining equational knowledge and missing value imputation,NO,,,,"Several institutions collect statistical data about cities, regions, and countries for various purposes. Yet, while access to high quality and recent such data is both crucial for decision makers and a means for achieving transparency to the public, all too often such collections of data remain isolated and not re-useable, let alone comparable or properly integrated. In this paper we present the Open City Data Pipeline, a focused attempt to collect, integrate, and enrich statistical data collected at city level worldwide, and re-publish the resulting dataset in a re-useable manner as Linked Data. The main features of the Open City Data Pipeline are: (i) we integrate and cleanse data from several sources in a modular and extensible, always up-to-date fashion; (ii) we use both Machine Learning techniques and reasoning over equational background knowledge to enrich the data by imputing missing values, (iii) we assess the estimated accuracy of such imputations per indicator. Additionally, (iv) we make the integrated and enriched data, including links to external data sources, such as DBpedia, available both in a web browser interface and as machine-readable Linked Data, using standard vocabularies such as QB and PROV. Apart from providing a contribution to the growing collection of data available as Linked Data, our enrichment process for missing values also contributes a novel methodology for combining rule-based inference about equational knowledge with inferences obtained from statistical Machine Learning approaches. While most existing works about inference in Linked Data have focused on ontological reasoning in RDFS and OWL, we believe that these complementary methods and particularly their combination could be fruitfully applied also in many other domains for integrating Statistical Linked Data, independent from our concrete use case of integrating city data.  2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bischof, Stefan; Harth, Andreas; Kampgen, Benedikt; Polleres, Axel; Schneider, Patrik",10.1016/j.websem.2017.09.003,journalArticle,F6EAANP5,2018,,1

DRIPP: DRIVEN POINT PROCESSES to MODEL STIMULI INDUCED PATTERNS in M/EEG SIGNALS,NO,,,,"The quantitative analysis of non-invasive electrophysiology signals from electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) boils down to the identification of temporal patterns such as evoked responses, transient bursts of neural oscillations but also blinks or heartbeats for data cleaning. Several works have shown that these patterns can be extracted efficiently in an unsupervised way, e.g., using Convolutional Dictionary Learning. This leads to an event-based description of the data. Given these events, a natural question is to estimate how their occurrences are modulated by certain cognitive tasks and experimental manipulations. To address it, we propose a point process approach. While point processes have been used in neuroscience in the past, in particular for single cell recordings (spike trains), techniques such as Convolutional Dictionary Learning make them amenable to human studies based on EEG/MEG signals. We develop a novel statistical point process model  called driven temporal point processes (DriPP)  where the intensity function of the point process model is linked to a set of point processes corresponding to stimulation events. We derive a fast and principled expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. Simulations reveal that model parameters can be identified from long enough signals. Results on standard MEG datasets demonstrate that our methodology reveals event-related neural responses  both evoked and induced  and isolates non-task-specific temporal patterns.

Deep entity matching with adversarial active learning,YES,ML4DC,tabular,el,"Entity matching (EM), as a fundamental task in data cleansing and integration, aims to identify the data records in databases that refer to the same real-world entity. While recent deep learning technologies significantly improve the performance of EM, they are often restrained by large-scale noisy data and insufficient labeled examples. In this paper, we present a novel EM approach based on deep neural networks and adversarial active learning. Specifically, we design a deep EM model to automatically complete missing textual values and capture both similarity and difference between records. Given that learning massive parameters in the deep model needs expensive labeling cost, we propose an adversarial active learning framework, which leverages active learning to collect a small amount of ""good"" examples and adversarial learning to augment the examples for stability enhancement. Additionally, to deal with large-scale databases, we present a dynamic blocking method that can be interactively tuned with the deep EM model. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of our approach and validate the effectiveness of all the proposed modules.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Huang, Jiacheng; Hu, Wei; Bao, Zhifeng; Chen, Qijin; Qu, Yuzhong",10.1007/s00778-022-00745-1,journalArticle,98FLVMQY,2022,aug,1
Forecasting of Heart Diseases in Early Stages Using Machine Learning Approaches,NO,,,,"In the area of computer science, the terms 'machine learning' as well as 'data science' are no longer new buzzwords.

ML may be used to determine if a person has a cardiovascular illness based on particular characteristics such as chest discomfort, cholesterol levels, age, and other factors. Cardiovascular disease diagnosis can be simplified using ML classification algorithms that are based on supervised learning.

"Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Acute Respiratory Failure, Ventilator Dependence, and Mortality in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease",NO,,,,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of mortality and contributes to high morbidity worldwide. Patients with COPD have a higher risk for acute respiratory failure, ventilator dependence, and mortality after hospitalization compared with the general population. Accurate and early risk detection will provide more information for early management and better decision making. This study aimed to build prediction models using patients' characteristics, laboratory data, and comorbidities for early detection of acute respiratory failure, ventilator dependence, and mortality in patients with COPD after hospitalization. We retrospectively collected the electronic medical records of 5061 patients with COPD in three hospitals of the Chi Mei Medical Group, Taiwan. After data cleaning, we built three prediction models for acute respiratory failure, ventilator dependence, and mortality using seven machine learning algorithms. Based on the AUC value, the best model for mortality was built by the XGBoost algorithm (AUC = 0.817), the best model for acute respiratory failure was built by random forest algorithm (AUC = 0.804), while the best model for ventilator dependence was built by LightGBM algorithm (AUC = 0.809). A web service application was implemented with the best models and integrated into the existing hospital information system for physician's trials and evaluations. Our machine learning models exhibit excellent predictive quality and can therefore provide physicians with a useful decision-making reference for the adverse prognosis of COPD patients.","Liao, KM; Liu, CF; Chen, CJ; Shen, YT",10.3390/diagnostics11122396,journalArticle,XEDXDBK4,2021,,1
Data collection and quality challenges in deep learning: A data-centric AI perspective,Secondary works,,,,"Software 2.0 is a fundamental shift in software engineering where machine learning becomes the new software, powered by big data and computing infrastructure. As a result, software engineering needs to be re-thought where data becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation is that 8090% of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation and data cleaning techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training where using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model training. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve problems in these directions.  2021, CC BY.","Whang, Steven Euijong; Roh, Yuji; Song, Hwanjun; Lee, Jae-Gil",,journalArticle,D4TQEK9E,2021,,1

A hybrid data cleaning framework using Markov logic networks,YES,ML4DC,?,features,"With the increase of dirty data, data cleaning turns into a crux of data analysis. Most of the existing algorithms rely on either qualitative techniques (e.g., data rules) or quantitative ones (e.g., statistical methods). In this paper, we present a novel hybrid data cleaning framework on top of Markov logic networks (MLNs), termed as MLNClean, which is capable of cleaning both schema-level and instance-level errors. MLNClean mainly consists of two cleaning stages, namely, first cleaning multiple data versions separately (each of which corresponds to one data rule), and then deriving the final clean data based on multiple data versions. Moreover, we propose a series of techniques/concepts, e.g., the MLN index, the concepts of reliability score and fusion score, to facilitate the cleaning process. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of MLNClean to the state-of-the-art approach in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS FOR DIRECT CURRENT TRACK CODED SIGNALS,NO,,,,"Designed for detecting train presence on tracks, track circuits must maintain a level of high availability for railway signaling systems. Due to the fail-safe nature of these critical devices, any failures will result in a declaration of occupancy in a section of track which restricts train movements. It is possible to automatically diagnose and, in some cases, predict the failures of track circuits by performing analytics on the track signals. In order to perform these analytics, we need to study the coded signals transmitted to and received from the track. However, these signals consist of heterogeneous pulses that are noisy for data analysis. Thus, we need techniques which will automatically group homogeneous pulses into similar groups. In this paper, we present data cleansing techniques which will cluster pulses based on digital analysis and machine learning. We report the results of our evaluation of clustering algorithms that improve the quality of analytic data. The data were captured under revenue service conditions operated by Alstom. For clustering algorithm, we used the kappa-means algorithm to cluster heterogeneous pulses. By tailoring the parameters for this algorithm, we can control the pulses of the cluster, allowing for further analysis of the track circuit signals in order to gain insight regarding its performance.","Qin, S; Mijatovic, N; Fries, J; Kiss, J; ASME",,conferencePaper,G8BKYTMP,2019,,1

Green intelligent financial system construction paradigm based on deep learning and concurrency models,NO,,,,"Green finance represents a new trend and new direction for future financial development, and it is an innovation and change in the financial field. The role of the financial market in environmental protection has gradually become the consensus of the financial community. Although the total amount of environmental protection investment in China shows a growing trend, the actual environmental protection investment still has a large gap compared with the increasing capital demand for environmental protection work. Financial resources play a key role in resource allocation. As long as funds are gradually withdrawn from polluting industries, they will be more invested in green and environmental industries, and resources such as land and labor will be optimally allocated. Faced with the complex international and domestic economic environment and increasing environmental pressures, this article proposes the green intelligent financial system construction paradigm based on deep learning and concurrency models.

CCCa framework - Classification system in big data environment with clustering and cache concepts,NO,,,,"The expansion of the data is swelling at an astonishing pace. The increasing usage of the digital technology massively increases the growth of the data generated by individuals or organizations/corporation produces big data. The big data environment generally uses the Map reduce framework which will take care of the job execution in Hadoop. Nowadays SPARK is becoming a popular framework which is written on top of the Hadoop framework to elevate the execution speed using runtime environment. A novel CCCa framework is proposed in this paper which includes the classification, clustering and cache techniques. This input data quality is improved by data cleansing activity. Similarity based clustering technique is involved to partition the job data into various clusters. Classification phase predicts the behavior of the data and artificial neural network (ANN) is applied for the classification of big data by means of the back propagation technique. The cache substitution technique is recommended to avoid the repetition of job processing. The proposed framework assures the consumption of less memory, computational time and achieved a higher level of accuracy and the prediction of the behavior of the dataset.

An efficient way of text-based emotion analysis from social media using LRA-DNN,NO,,,,"Text devices are effectively and heavily used for interactions these days. Emotion extraction from the text has derived huge importance and is upcoming area of research in Natural Language Processing. Recognition of emotions from text has high practical utilities for quality improvement like in Human-Computer Interaction, recommendation systems, online education, data mining and so on. However, there are the issues of irrelevant feature extraction during emotion extraction from text. It causes mis-prediction of emotion. To overcome such challenges, this paper proposes a Leaky Relu activated Deep Neural Network (LRA-DNN). The proposed model comes under four categories, such as pre-processing, feature extraction, ranking and classification. The collected data from the dataset are pre-processed for data cleansing, appropriate features are extracted from the pre-processed data, relevant ranks are assigned for each extracted feature in the ranking phase and finally, the data are classified and accurate output is obtained from the classification phase. Publically available datasets are used in this research to compare the results obtained by the proposed LRA-DNN with the previous state-of-art algorithms. The outcomes indicated that the proposed LRA-DNN obtains the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the rate of 94.77%, 92.23%, and 95.91% respectively which is promising compared to the existing ANN, DNN and CNN methods. It also efficiently reduces the mis-prediction and misclassification error.","Shelke, Nilesh; Chaudhury, Sushovan; Chakrabarti, Sudakshina; Bangare, Sunil L.; Yogapriya, G.; Pandey, Pratibha",10.1016/j.neuri.2022.100048,journalArticle,CA6MEIUI,2022,,1
Towards markerless computer-aided surgery combining deep segmentation and geometric pose estimation: application in total knee arthroplasty,NO,,,,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical procedure performed in patients suffering from knee arthritis. The correct positioning of the implants is strongly related to multiple surgical variables that have a tremendous impact on the success of the surgery. Computer-based navigation systems have been investigated and developed in order to assist the surgeon in accurately controlling those surgical variables. The existing technologies are very costly, require additional bone incisions for fixing markers to be tracked, and these markers are usually bulky, interfering with the standard surgical flow. This work presents a markerless navigation system that supports the surgeon in accurately performing the TKA procedure. The proposed system uses a mobile RGB-D camera for replacing the existing optical tracking systems and does not require markers to be tracked. We combine an effective deep learning-based approach for accurately segmenting the bone surface with a robust geometry-based algorithm for registering the bones with pre-operative models. The favourable performance of our pipeline is achieved by (1) employing a semi-supervised labelling approach for generating training data from real TKA surgery data, (2) using effective data augmentation techniques for improving the generalisation capability and (3) using appropriate depth data cleaning strategies. The construction of this complete markerless registration prototype that generalises for unseen intra-operative data is non-obvious, and relevant insights and future research directions can be derived. The experimental results show encouraging performance for video-based TKA.","Felix, I.; Raposo, C.; Antunes, M.; Rodrigues, P.; Barreto, J.P.",10.1080/21681163.2020.1835554,journalArticle,UXNT5QXQ,2021,,1

"IndiaSat: A Pixel-Level Dataset for Land-Cover Classification on Three Satellite Systems - Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2",NO,,,,"Land-cover (LC) classification is required for land management and planning models, and is increasingly done through remote sensing data. Supervised machine learning methods applied to satellite imagery can help with high-resolution LC classification but demand a labeled dataset for training and evaluation of the models. The availability of such datasets is limited though, especially for developing regions like in India. We describe a large pixel-level dataset, IndiaSat, that we have curated and provided for open use, consisting of 180,414 pixels labeled into four LC classes: greenery, water bodies, barren land, and built-up area. Initial labels are obtained through the crowd-sourced mapping platform Open Street Maps (OSM), and then manually curated and corrected. We describe our data cleaning methodology and ensure spatial diversity across different geographic regions in the country. We show that the IndiaSat dataset can be used to train simple classifiers deployed on commodity platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) for three popular and openly accessible satellite systems: Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2, with high accuracy, and to additionally build LC change detection models to determine pixel-level changes over a sequence of several years.  2021 ACM.","Bansal, Chahat; Ahlawat, Hari Om; Jain, Mayank; Prakash, Om; Mehta, Shivani A; Singh, Deepanshu; Baheti, Harshavardhansushil; Singh, Suyash; Seth, Aaditeshwar",10.1145/3460112.3471953,conferencePaper,CZRYGKSM,2021,,1

Opportunistic method for road surface noise labelling: Data cleaning,Specific,,,,"Road surface type and degradation contribute significantly to the rolling noise emission. In recent times, due to the innovation in vehicle propulsion, rolling noise also becomes a main factor in noise emission for lower order roads. Monitoring and labelling these roads, requires considerably more effort than monitoring primary roads and highways due to their large number. Therefore, we propose an opportunistic method where vehicles that are on the roads for other purposes, are used for rolling noise monitoring. The proposed method may also have some additional benefits over the standard CPX regarding the distribution of tires used and the spread of typical driving speeds. However, measurement conditions are not as well known and may influence the results obtained from individual vehicles significantly. The abundance of measurements data from many vehicles will nevertheless allow to eliminate any modifiers and confounders. To that end, a machine learning cleaning algorithm inspired by denoising auto-encoders has been designed and implemented. This cleaning algorithm improves the convergence of measurements, giving the same quality of measurements with a lower number of passages and cars on a road segment.

However, Spark and Flink usually show different performance under batch and stream processing workloads.

Smart traffic management system using deep learning for smart city applications,NO,,,,"Already known as densely populated areas with land use including housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities and communication, nowadays, cities tend to grow even bigger. Genuine road-user's types are emerging with further technological developments to come. As cities population size escalates, and roads getting congested, government agencies such as Department of Transportation (DOT) through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are in pressing need to perfect their management systems with new efficient technologies. The challenge is to anticipate on never before seen problems, in their effort to save lives and implement sustainable cost-effective management systems. To make things yet more complicated and a bit daunting, self-driving car will be authorized in a close future in crowded major cities where roads are to be shared among pedestrians, cyclists, cars, and trucks. Roads sizes and traffic signaling will need to be constantly adapted accordingly. Counting and classifying turning vehicles and pedestrians at an intersection is an exhausting task and despite traffic monitoring systems use, human interaction is heavily required for counting. Our approach to resolve traffic intersection turning-vehicles counting is less invasive, requires no road dig up or costly installation. Live or recorded videos from already installed camera all over the cities can be used as well as any camera including cellphones. Our system is based on Neural Network and Deep Learning of object detection along computer vision technology and several methods and algorithms. Our approach will work on still images, recorded-videos, real-time live videos and will detect, classify, track and compute moving object velocity and direction using convolution neural network.

When Considering More Elements: Attribute Correlation in Unsupervised Data Cleaning under Blocking,YES,ML4DC,?,features,"In banks, governments, and internet companies, due to the increasing demand for data in various information systems and continuously shortening of the cycle for data collection and update, there may be a variety of data quality issues in a database. As the expansion of data scales, methods such as pre-specifying business rules or introducing expert experience into a repair process are no longer applicable to some information systems requiring rapid responses. In this case, we divided data cleaning into supervised and unsupervised forms according to whether there were interventions in the repair processes and put forward a new dimension suitable for unsupervised cleaning in this paper. For weak logic errors in unsupervised data cleaning, we proposed an attribute correlation-based (ACB)-Framework under blocking, and designed three different data blocking methods to reduce the time complexity and test the impact of clustering accuracy on data cleaning. The experiments showed that the blocking methods could effectively reduce the repair time by maintaining the repair validity. Moreover, we concluded that the blocking methods with a too high clustering accuracy tended to put tuples with the same elements into a data block, which reduced the cleaning ability. In summary, the ACB-Framework with blocking can reduce the corresponding time cost and does not need the guidance of domain knowledge or interventions in repair, which can be applied in information systems requiring rapid responses, such as internet web pages, network servers, and sensor information acquisition.",Pei Li; Chaofan Dai; Wenqian Wang,10.3390/sym11040575,journalArticle,ZU8G4IBR,2019,aug,1

Robust classification with noisy labels for manufacturing applications: a hybrid approach based on active learning and data cleaning,Specific,,,,"Classification is an important machine learning technique that attracts growing interests in various manufacturing applications. Learning an accurate classifier generally requires a large-scale perfectly-labeled training dataset. However, such ""golden"" labels are not only expensive but also difficult to collect in practice. To facilitate accurate classification in the presence of noisy labels, we propose a novel hybrid method based on active learning and data cleaning. Specifically, we first train an initial classifier with noisily- labeled data. Based on its prediction outcomes, a set of most informative samples is queried for manual annotation. To effectively correct other incorrect labels, we further self-label the unqueried samples based on the true labels provided by human experts and the estimated labels predicted by the initial classifier. As demonstrated by the experimental results based on two industrial datasets, the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy over other conventional methods.",Shuo Zhao; Xin Li; Ying-Chi Chen,10.1109/IECON48115.2021.9589632,conferencePaper,JSSNWB2U,2021,,1
Responsible AI challenges in end-to-end machine learning,NO,,,,"Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday lives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision  depth, breadth, and usability  to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.  2021, CC BY.","Whang, Steven Euijong; Tae, Ki Hyun; Roh, Yuji; Heo, Geon",,journalArticle,CKQ3T3S7,2021,,1
A Survey on Sampling and Profiling over Big Data (Technical Report),NO,,,,"Due to the development of internet technology and computer science, data is exploding at an exponential rate. Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Hence, sampling technology has been widely studied and used in big data context, e.g., methods for determining sample size, combining sampling with big data processing frameworks. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Therefore, this paper focuses on researching sampling and profiling in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling tasks. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.

Medical Specialty Recommendations by an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot on a Smartphone: Development and Deployment,NO,,,,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has limited daily activities and even contact between patients and primary care providers. This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients'symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. Objective: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. Methods: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. Results: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F-1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F-1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. Conclusions: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful.

State-of-health estimation of lithium-ion batteries based on semi-supervised transfer component analysis,NO,,,,"Accurate state-of-health estimation can ensure the safe and reliable operation of Lithium-ion batteries in any given application. Nevertheless, most of the state-of-health estimation methods require a large amount of laboratory aging data to offer precise results. As obtaining battery aging data under laboratory conditions requires a considerable amount of time and incurs high economic costs, in this paper, a method based on transfer learning is proposed to monitor state-of-health of batteries. A novel data processing method based on maximum mean discrepancy is considered to eliminate redundant information and minimize the difference between different data distributions. Then, mutual information is used to prove that the correlation between processed data is not decreased. To validate the developed transfer learning method, the data sets of four batteries in different working conditions are considered. Different error-detection methods, maximum average error, mean squared error and root mean squared error, which are utilized to evaluate the proposed model. The state of health is estimated effectively with less than 2.5% error considering the aforementioned errors after processed by using semi-supervised transfer component analysis algorithm, although the training set only accounts for about 35% of the entire set. The results indicate that transfer learning plays an important role in improving the estimation accuracy of a battery state-of-health.

To properly analyze data, it is important to maintain high-quality data. Thus, research on data cleaning is also important. It is difficult to automatically detect and correct inconsistent values for data requiring expert knowledge or data created by many contributors, such as integrated data from heterogeneous data sources. An example of such data is metadata for scientific datasets, which should be confirmed by data managers while handling the data. To support the efficient cleaning of data by data managers, we propose a data cleaning architecture in which data managers interactively browse and correct portions of data through views.

IMPLEMENTATION OF A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF INDONESIA'S 2019 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,NO,,,,"In 2019, citizens of Indonesia participated in the democratic process of electing a new president, vice president, and various legislative candidates for the country. The 2019 Indonesian presidential election was very tense in terms of the candidates' campaigns in cyberspace, especially on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, etc. The Indonesian people used social media platforms to express their positive, neutral, and also negative opinions on the respective presidential candidates. The campaigning of respective social media users on their choice of candidates for regents, governors, and legislative positions up to presidential candidates was conducted via the Internet and online media. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to conduct sentiment analysis on the candidates in the 2019 Indonesia presidential election based on Twitter datasets. The study used datasets on the opinions expressed by the Indonesian people available on Twitter with the hashtags (#) containing ""Jokowi and Prabowo."" We conducted data pre-processing using a selection of comments, data cleansing, text parsing, sentence normalization and tokenization based on the given text in the Indonesian language, determination of class attributes, and, finally, we classified the Twitter posts with the hashtags (#) using Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve an optimal and maximum optimization accuracy. The study provides benefits in terms of helping the community to research opinions on Twitter that contain positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Sentiment Analysis on the candidates in the 2019 Indonesian presidential election on Twitter using non-conventional processes resulted in cost, time, and effort savings. This research proved that the combination of the SVM machine learning algorithm and alphabetic tokenization produced the highest accuracy value of 79.02%. While the lowest accuracy value in this study was obtained with a combination of the NBC machine learning algorithm and N-gram tokenization with an accuracy value of 44.94%.","Buntoro, GA; Arifin, R; Syaifuddiin, GN; Selamat, A; Krejcar, O; Viedma, EREA; Fujita, H",10.31436/iiumej.v22i1.1532,journalArticle,DGIR7GI9,2021,,1

Using internet search queries to predict human mobility in social events,NO,,,,"While our transport systems are generally designed for habitual behavior, the dynamics of large and mega cities systematically push it to its limits. Particularly, transport planning and operations in large events are well known to be a challenge. Not only they imply stress to the system on an irregular basis, their associated mobility behavior is also difficult to predict. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between number of public transport arrivals with the semi-structured data mined from online announcement websites. However, these models tend to be complex in form and demand substantial information retrieval, extraction and data cleaning work, and so they are difficult to generalize from city to city. In contrast, this paper focuses on enriching previously mined information about special events using automated web search queries. Since this context data comes in unstructured natural language form, we employ supervised topic model to correlate it with real measurements of transport usage. In this way, the proposed approach is more generic and a transit agency can start planning ahead as early as the event is announced on the web. The results show that using information mined from the web search not only shows high prediction accuracy of public transport demand, but also potentially provides interesting insights about popular event categories based on extracted topics.",S.

An Efficient Approach to Software Fault Prediction,NO,,,,"The use of machine learning concepts in the software engineering field is now ubiquitous to predict software defects. Most of the Software Defect Prediction (SDP) datasets are highly imbalanced and filled with multiple irrelevant features that cause negative effects on the results.

To balance the datasets, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) oversampling technique has been used. Furthermore, to select the relevant features, three well-known feature selection techniques, as well as their ensembles, have been applied.

An Automated In-Depth Feature Learning Algorithm for Breast Abnormality Prognosis and Robust Characterization from Mammography Images Using Deep Transfer Learning,NO,,,,"Simple Summary Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters is crucial in mammography, which reduces disease consequences and initiates treatment at an early stage. A misinterpretation of mammography may lead to an unneeded biopsy of the false-positive results, decreasing the patient's chances of survival. This study aims to increase the probability of early breast mass identification to ensure better treatment and minimize mortality risk. However, this study proposes a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to extract features of varying densities and classify normal and suspicious mammography regions. Two different experiments were carried out to validate the consistency of diagnoses and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks. Additionally, the deep features extracted are used to train the support vector machine algorithm, resulting in an outstanding performance in the second experiment. Furthermore, this study confirms an improvement in mass recognition accuracy through data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation. Our deep learning hybrid model obtained a classification accuracy of 97.8%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model's improvements are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist's strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients' mammography images. Background: Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters have paramount significance in mammography, which aids in mitigating the disease's complexities and curing it at early stages. However, a wrong mammogram interpretation may lead to an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive findings, which reduces the patient's survival chances. Consequently, approaches that learn to discern breast masses can reduce the number of misconceptions and incorrect diagnoses. Conventionally used classification models focus on feature extraction techniques specific to a particular problem based on domain information. Deep learning strategies are becoming promising alternatives to solve the many challenges of feature-based approaches. Methods: This study introduces a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based deep learning method to extract features at varying densities and discern mammography's normal and suspected regions. Two different experiments were carried out to make an accurate diagnosis and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). The in-depth features extracted from the ConvNet are also used to train the support vector machine algorithm to achieve excellent performance in the second experiment. Additionally, DCNN is the most frequently used image interpretation and classification method, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Moreover, this study pertains to data cleaning, preprocessing, and data augmentation, and improving mass recognition accuracy. The efficacy of all models is evaluated by training and testing three mammography datasets and has exhibited remarkable results. Results: Our deep learning ConvNet+SVM model obtained a discriminative training accuracy of 97.7% and validating accuracy of 97.8%, contrary to this, VGGNet16 method yielded 90.2%, 93.5% for VGGNet19, 63.4% for GoogLeNet, 82.9% for MobileNetV2, 75.1% for ResNet50, and 72.9% for DenseNet121. Conclusions: The proposed model's improvement and validation are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist's strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients' mammography images.","Mahmood, T; Li, JQ; Pei, Y; Akhtar, F",10.3390/biology10090859,journalArticle,N5DUALMY,2021,,1
Optimal Feature Selection with Weight Optimised Deep Neural Network for Incremental Learning-Based Intrusion Detection in Fog Environment,NO,,,,"Fog computing acts as an intermediate component to reduce the delays in communication among end-users and the cloud that offer local processing of requests among end-users through fog devices. Thus, the primary aim of fog devices is to ensure the authenticity of incoming network traffic. Anyhow, these fog devices are susceptible to malicious attacks. An efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is necessary to offer secure functioning of fog for improving efficiency. IDSs are a fundamental component for any security system like the Internet of things (IoT) and fog networks for ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS). Even though different machine learning and deep learning models have shown their efficiency in intrusion detection, the deep insight of managing the incremental data is a complex part. Therefore, the main intent of this paper is to implement an effective model for intrusion detection in a fog computing platform. Initially, the data dealing with intrusion are collected from diverse benchmark sources. Further, data cleaning is performed, which is to identify and remove errors and duplicate data, to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables accurate decision making. The conceptual and temporal features are extracted. Concerning reducing the data length for reducing the training complexity, optimal feature selection is performed based on an improved meta-heuristic concept termed Modified Active Electrolocation-based Electric Fish Optimization (MAE-EFO). With the optimally selected features or data, incremental learning-based detection is accomplished by Incremental Deep Neural Network (I-DNN). This deep learning model optimises the testing weight using the proposed MAE-EFO by concerning the objective as to minimise the error difference between the predicted and actual results, thus enhancing the performance of new incremental data. The validation of the proposed model on the benchmark datasets and other datasets achieves an attractive performance when compared over other state-of-the-art IDSs.  2022 World Scientific Publishing Co.","Abdussami, Aftab Alam; Farooqui, Mohammed Faizan",10.1142/S0219649222500423,journalArticle,W2WAE8U9,2022,,1
Deep metric learning with locality sensitive angular loss for self-correcting source separation of neural spiking signals,NO,,,,"Neurophysiological time series, such as electromyographic signal and intracortical recordings, are typically composed of many individual spiking sources, the recovery of which can give fundamental insights into the biological system of interest or provide neural information for man-machine interfaces. For this reason, source separation algorithms have become an increasingly important tool in neuroscience and neuroengineering. However, in noisy or highly multivariate recordings these decomposition techniques often make a large number of errors, which degrades human-machine interfacing applications and often requires costly post-hoc manual cleaning of the output label set of spike timestamps. To address both the need for automated post-hoc cleaning and robust separation filters we propose a methodology based on deep metric learning, using a novel loss function which maintains intra-class variance, creating a rich embedding space suitable for both label cleaning and the discovery of new activations. We then validate this method with an artificially corrupted label set based on source-separated high-density surface electromyography recordings, recovering the original timestamps even in extreme degrees of feature and class-dependent label noise. This approach enables a neural network to learn to accurately decode neurophysiological time series using any imperfect method of labelling the signal.  2021, CC BY-SA.","Clarke, Alexander Kenneth; Farina, Dario",,journalArticle,R6KV9QSG,2021,,1

The purpose of this paper is to help researchers gain a proper understanding of machine learning and its applications in healthcare. In this paper, we first present a classification of machine learning-based schemes in healthcare. According to our proposed taxonomy, machine learning-based schemes in healthcare are categorized based on data pre-processing methods (data cleaning methods, data reduction methods), learning methods (unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning), evaluation methods (simulation-based evaluation and practical implementation-based evaluation in real environment) and applications (diagnosis, treatment).

A case-based reasoning system for recommendation of data cleaning algorithms in classification and regression tasks,NO,,,,"Recently, advances in Information Technologies (social networks, mobile applications, Internet of Things, etc.) generate a deluge of digital data; but to convert these data into useful information for business decisions is a growing challenge. Exploiting the massive amount of data through knowledge discovery (KD) process includes identifying valid, novel, potentially useful and understandable patterns from a huge volume of data. However, to prepare the data is a non-trivial refinement task that requires technical expertise in methods and algorithms for data cleaning. Consequently, the use of a suitable data analysis technique is a headache for inexpert users. To address these problems, we propose a case-based reasoning system (CBR) to recommend data cleaning algorithms for classification and regression tasks. In our approach, we represent the problem space by the meta-features of the dataset, its attributes, and the target variable. The solution space contains the algorithms of data cleaning used for each dataset. We represent the cases through a Data Cleaning Ontology. The case retrieval mechanism is composed of a filter and similarity phases. In the first phase, we defined two filter approaches based on clustering and quartile analysis. These filters retrieve a reduced number of relevant cases. The second phase computes a ranking of the retrieved cases by filter approaches, and it scores a similarity between a new case and the retrieved cases. The retrieval mechanism proposed was evaluated through a set of judges. The panel of judges scores the similarity between a query case against all cases of the case-base (ground truth). The results of the retrieval mechanism reach an average precision on judges ranking of 94.5% in top 3 (P@3), for top 7 (P@7) 84.55%, while in top 10 (P@10) 78.35%.","Corrales, David Camilo; Ledezma, Agapito; Corrales, Juan Carlos",10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106180,journalArticle,W58FAIW5,2020,,1

CNN for Detection of COVID-19 Using Chest X-Ray Images,NO,,,,"Coronavirus spread globally in the late 2019, causing the wholeworld to face an existential health crisis. According to the recent report, animals may also get infected by the virus, so something needs to be done to eliminate this threat named corona. What if we are able to detect the virus at an early stage so that the time it gets to the critical condition, we would be equipped with certain measures. The first thing that gets affected in the body of the infected person are the lungs. So to check out the lung infection, we alreadyhave certain traditional techniques, but theautomated detection of lung infection using CT Images gives an edge over the traditional healthcare system. Several challenges are faced in the segmentation of infected regions, including high variation in infection characteristics and low-intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. In this work, we have taken the PA view of the chest X-ray images, which were found unhealthy at the time of screening.

A Qualitative Assessment of Machine Learning Support for Detecting Data Completeness and Accuracy Issues to Improve Data Analytics in Big Data for the Healthcare Industry,Specific,,,,"Tackling Data Quality issues as part of Big Data can be challenging. For data cleansing activities, manual methods are not efficient due to the potentially very large amount of data. This paper aims to qualitatively assess the possibilities for using machine learning in the process of detecting data incompleteness and inaccuracy, since these two data quality dimensions were found to be the most significant by a previous research study conducted by the authors. A review of existing literature concludes that there is no unique machine learning algorithm most suitable to deal with both incompleteness and inaccuracy of data. Various algorithms are selected from existing studies and applied against a representative big (healthcare) dataset. Following experiments, it was also discovered that the implementation of machine learning algorithms in this context encounters several challenges for Big Data quality activities. These challenges are related to the amount of data particualar machine learning algorithms can scale to and also to certain data type restrictions imposed by some machine learning algorithms. The study concludes that 1) data imputation works better with linear regression models, 2) clustering models are more efficient to detect outliers but fully automated systems may not be realistic in this context. Therefore, a certain level of human judgement is still needed.  2020 IEEE.","Juddoo, Suraj; George, Carlisle",10.1109/ELECOM49001.2020.9297009,conferencePaper,6CFR654T,2020,,1
Accurate Prediction Scheme of Water Quality in Smart Mariculture With Deep Bi-S-SRU Learning Network,NO,,,,"In the smart mariculture, the timely and accurate predictions of water quality can help farmers take countermeasures before the ecological environment deteriorates seriously. However, the openness of the mariculture environment makes the variation of water quality nonlinear, dynamic and complex. Traditional methods face challenges in prediction accuracy and generalization performance. To address these problems, an accurate water quality prediction scheme is proposed for pH, water temperature and dissolved oxygen. First, we construct a new huge raw data set collected in time series consisting of 23,204 groups of data. Then, the water quality parameters are preprocessed for data cleaning successively through threshold processing, mean proximity method, wavelet filter, and improved smoothing method. Next, the correlation between the water quality to be predicted and other dynamics parameters is revealed by the Pearson correlation coefficient method. Meanwhile, the data for training is weighted by the discovered correlation coefficients. Finally, by adding a backward SRU node to the training sequence, which can be integrated into the future context information, the deep Bi-S-SRU (Bi-directional Stacked Simple Recurrent Unit) learning network is proposed. After training, the prediction model can be obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed prediction method achieve higher prediction accuracy than the method based on RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with similar or less time computing complexity. In our experiments, the proposed method takes 12.5ms to predict data on average, and the prediction accuracy can reach 94.42&amp;#x0025; in the next 3&amp;#x007E;8 days.",J. Liu; C. Yu; Z. Hu; Y.

Outdated Fact Detection in Knowledge Bases,NO,,,,"Knowledge bases (KBs), which store high-quality information, are crucial for many applications, such as enhancing search results and serving as external sources for data cleaning. Not surprisingly, there exist outdated facts in most KBs due to the rapid change of information. Naturally, it is important to keep KBs up-to-date. Traditional wisdom has investigated the problem of using reference data (such as new facts extracted from the news) to detect outdated facts in KBs. However, existing approaches can only cover a small percentage of facts in KBs. In this paper, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop approach for outdated fact detection in KBs. It trains a binary classifier using features such as historical update frequency and existence time of a fact to compute the likelihood of a fact in a KB to be outdated. Then, it interacts with humans to verify whether a fact with high likelihood is indeed outdated. In addition, it also uses logical rules to detect more outdated facts based on human feedback. The outdated facts detected by the logical rules will also be fed back to train the ML model further for data augmentation. Extensive experiments on real-world KBs, such as Yago and DBpedia, show the effectiveness of our solution.",Shuang Hao; Chengliang Chai; Guoliang Li; Nan Tang; Ning Wang; Xiang Yu,10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00196,conferencePaper,YXURKVFS,2020,,1

Communication-Efficient Robust Federated Learning with Noisy Labels,NO,,,,"Federated learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm over distributed located data. In FL, the data is kept locally by each user. This protects the user privacy, but also makes the server difficult to verify data quality, especially if the data are correctly labeled. Training with corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however, little attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to mitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight for each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization performance over a validation set. More formally, the process can be formulated as a Federated Bilevel Optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problem is a type of optimization problem with two levels of entangled problems. The non-distributed bilevel problems have witnessed notable progress recently with new efficient algorithms. However, solving bilevel optimization problems under the Federated Learning setting is under-investigated. We identify that the high communication cost in hypergradient evaluation is the major bottleneck. So we propose Comm-FedBiO to solve the general Federated Bilevel Optimization problems; more specifically, we propose two communication-efficient subroutines to estimate the hypergradient. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve the noisy label problem. Our approach has shown superior performance on several real-world datasets compared to various baselines.  2022, CC BY.","Li, Junyi; Pei, Jian; Huang, Heng",10.48550/arXiv.2206.05558,journalArticle,WA5LMDIY,2022,,1
RumbleML: Program the lakehouse with JSONiq [Scalable Data Science],YES,DC4ML,any,,"Lakehouse systems have reached in the past few years unprecedented size and heterogeneity and have been embraced by many industry players. However, they are often difficult to use as they lack the declarative language and optimization possibilities of relational engines. This paper introduces RumbleML, a high-level, declarative library integrated into the RumbleDB engine and with the JSONiq language. RumbleML allows using a single platform for data cleaning, data preparation, training, and inference, as well as management of models and results. It does it using a purely declarative language (JSONiq) for all these tasks and without any performance loss over existing platforms (e.g. Spark). The key insights of the design of RumbleML are that training sets, evaluation sets, and test sets can be represented as homogeneous sequences of flat objects; that models can be seamlessly embodied in function items mapping input test sets into prediction-augmented result sets; and that estimators can be seamlessly embodied in function items mapping input training sets to models. We argue that this makes JSONiq a viable and seamless programming language for data lakehouses across all their features, whether database-related or machine-learning-related. While lakehouses bring Machine Learning and Data Wrangling on the same platform, RumbleML also brings them to the same language, JSONiq. In the paper, we present the first prototype and compare its performance to Spark showing the benefit of a huge functionality and productivity gain for cleaning up, normalizing, validating data, feeding it into Machine Learning pipelines, and analyzing the output, all within the same system and language and at scale.MSC Codes 68N99 Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Predictive maintenance of abnormal wind turbine events by using machine learning based on condition monitoring for anomaly detection,NO,,,,"The predictive maintenance of wind turbines has become a critical issue with the rapid development of wind power generation. The early detection of abnormal operation conditions can prevent failure status, which takes a long time to recover. Energy waste can also be reduced while maintenance efficiency can be improved by using a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to monitor the operation status of wind turbines. Massive data are generated from different sensors during wind turbine operation, and SCADA can be used to gather reports about hundreds of possible abnormal conditions. The popular maintenance methods have been mostly designed on the basis of statistical analysis and data mining. However, such schemes need not only big data but also sophisticated processing techniques. This study addresses the aforementioned challenges by proposing a deep learning model with comprehensive data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on batch size to achieve abnormal early detection. The necessary data preprocessing is initially conducted besides the conventional data cleaning and normalization steps, and time-series data windowing and label settings are also performed. Then, the imbalanced classes in the records are addressed by adopting an augmentation scheme called the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Principal component analysis is also used to enhance the training. Finally, the proposed deep learning method with fine-tuning is compared with three machine learning models for early anomaly event detection. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can identify potential faults 72 hours before they occur, and the precision rate exceeds 90 %.  2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chen, Huan; Hsu, Jyh-Yih; Hsieh, Jia-You; Hsu, Hsin-Yao; Chang, Chia-Hao; Lin, Yu-Ju",10.1007/s12206-021-1105-z,journalArticle,QRL7QWWT,2021,,1

An Accurate Neural Network for Cytologic Whole-Slide Image Analysis,NO,,,,"Typically, high accuracy in deep learning is achieved by large dataset in pixel-wise labeling for segmentation or image-level labeling for classification. However, in biomedical domain, the challenge is not only the availability of image data itself, but also the acquisition of relevant annotations for these images from clinicians. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage architecture to jointly perform the tasks of detection, segmentation and classification of abnormal cells and cancer. Compared with one-step detection for all the catalogues, we combine the advantage of image-level and pixel-level labeling in our deep learning based framework. We use the detection of lesions in cervical clinical dataset as a case study for performance evaluation. In the first stage, a hybrid ResNet and U-Net architecture is designed to predict three catalogues of nuclei, cytoplasm and background with pixel-wise labeled segmentation map. In the second stage, a residual learning based model is applied to the identified nuclei for subtype classification. Confirmed with cytotechnologist, the proposed model is estimated to efficiently deduct more than 90% annotation burden compared with pixel-wise labeling approach. Moreover, the proposed two-stage approach model outperforms one-stage neural network in segmentation and classification for objects with high similarities in appearance.

Railroad accident analysis using extreme gradient boosting,NO,,,,"Railroads are critical to the economic health of a nation. Unfortunately, railroads lose hundreds of millions of dollars from accidents each year. Trends reveal that derailments consistently account for more than 70 % of the U.S. railroad industry’s average annual accident cost. Hence, knowledge of explanatory factors that distinguish derailments from other accident types can inform more cost-effective and impactful railroad risk management strategies. Five feature scoring methods, including ANOVA and Gini, agreed that the top four explanatory factors in accident type prediction were track class, type of movement authority, excess speed, and territory signalization. Among 11 different types of machine learning algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting method was most effective at predicting the accident type with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) metric of 89 %. Principle component analysis revealed that relative to other accident types, derailments were more strongly associated with lower track classes, non-signalized territories, and movement authorizations within restricted limits. On average, derailments occurred at 16 kph below the speed limit for the track class whereas other accident types occurred at 32 kph below the speed limit. Railroads can use the integrated data preparation, machine learning, and feature ranking framework presented to gain additional insights for managing risk, based on their unique operating environments.","Bridgelall, Raj; Tolliver, Denver D.",10.1016/j.aap.2021.106126,journalArticle,2V35SNKC,2021,,1

Automation of cleaning and ensembles for outliers detection in questionnaire data,Specific,,,,"This article is focused on the automatic detection of the corrupted or inappropriate responses in questionnaire data using unsupervised outliers detection. The questionnaire surveys are often used in psychology research to collect self-report data and their preprocessing takes a lot of manual effort. Unlike with numerical data where the distance-based outliers prevail, the records in questionnaires have to be assessed from various perspectives that do not relate so much. We identify the most frequent types of errors in questionnaires. For each of them, we suggest different outliers detection methods ranking the records with the usage of normalized scores. Considering the similarity between pairs of outlier scores (some are highly uncorrelated), we propose an ensemble based on the union of outliers detected by different methods. Our outlier detection framework consists of some well-known algorithms but we also propose novel approaches addressing the typical issues of questionnaires. The selected methods are based on distance, entropy, and probability.

SVAD: End-to-End Sensory Data Analysis for IoBT-Driven Platforms,NO,,,,"The rapid advancement of IoT technologies has led to its flexible adoption in battle field networks, known as Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) networks. One important application of IoBT networks is the weather sensory network characterized with a variety of weather, land and environmental sensors.

To interpret the incoming data in real-time, machine learning algorithms are required to automate strategic decision-making.

Cognitive spammer: A Framework for PageRank analysis with Split by Over-sampling and Train by Under-fitting,NO,,,,"From the past few years, there is an exponential increase in one of the most popular technologies of the modern era called as Internet of Things (IoT). In IoT, various objects perform the tasks of sensing, communication, and computation for providing uninterrupted services (e.g., e-health, e-transportation, security access, etc.) to the end users. In this era, Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) is an another paradigm of IoT developed to enhance the capabilities of intelligence in IoT objects where these objects can take independent decisions in any environment. IoT follows the service oriented architecture (SOA), in which the application layer is the topmost layer. It enables the IoT objects to interact with the other objects located across the globe. The power of learning, thinking, and understanding by these objects, can make the information access more accurate and reliable but Web spam is one of the challenges while accessing information from the web. It has been observed from the literature review that search engines are preferred mostly by the people for accessing information. The efficient ranking by the search engines can reduce the computational cost of information exchange by IoT objects. Search engines should be able to prevent the spam from being injected into the web. But, the existing techniques for this problem target in finding the spam after its occurrence in search engine result pages. So, in this proposal, we present an intelligent cognitive spammer framework, Cognitive spammer, which eliminates the spam pages during the web page rank score calculation by search engines. The framework update the Google’s ranking algorithm, PageRank in such a way that it automatically prevents link spam by considering the link structure of web for rank score computation. The updated PageRank algorithm provided the better ranking of web pages. The proposed framework is validated with the WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset. Before processing, the dataset is preprocessed with a new technique, called as ‘Split by Over-sampling and Train by Under-fitting’ to remove the trade off between imbalanced instances of target class. After data cleaning, we applied machine learning techniques (Bagged model, Boosted linear model, etc) with the web page features to make accurate predictions. The detection classifiers only consider the link features of the web page irrespective of the page content. Out of the fifteen classifiers, best three are ensemble, which results in better performance with overall accuracy improvement. Ten-fold cross validation has also been applied with the resulted ensemble model, which results in getting the accuracy of 99.6% in the proposed scheme.","Makkar, Aaisha; Kumar, Neeraj",10.1016/j.future.2018.07.046,journalArticle,YWMZ9RRL,2019,,1

A Method for Anomaly Detection of State Information of Transformer Based on Association Rules and Elman Neural Network,NO,,,,"In order to identify the transformer abnormal state accurately, this paper presents a method considering the correlation degree between the monitoring sequences and using the Elman neural network. Firstly, the degree of association between the state monitoring of the transformer is calculated by the association rule, and the prediction error formula is modified by the sequence correlation degree. And then use the trained Elman neural network to predict the sequence to find the abnormal points. The abnormal data is divided into abnormal sensor data and abnormal device status data. For sensor abnormalities, data cleaning is required. For device status abnormalities, we need analyze the device's abnormal type. The test results show that the correlation analysis of sequence data and the combination of Elman neural network can effectively improve the accuracy of transformer state anomaly detection.  2018 IEEE.","Lin, Jun; Yan, Yingjie; Zhang, Qinqin; Sheng, Gehao; Xie, Da; Gu, Chenghong",10.1109/CMD.2018.8535763,conferencePaper,B6ATW4U9,2018,,1
Semantic Data Understanding with Character Level Learning,NO,,,,"Databases are growing in size and complexity. With the emergence of data lakes, databases have become open, fast evolving and highly heterogeneous. Understanding the complex relationships among different entity types in such scenarios is both challenging and necessary to data scientists. We propose an approach that utilizes a convolutional neural network to learn patterns associated with each entity type in the database at the character level. We demonstrate that the learned character-level patterns can capture sufficient semantic information for many useful applications including data lake schema exploration, and interactive data cleaning.  2020 IEEE.","Mior, Michael J.; Pu, Ken Q.",10.1109/IRI49571.2020.00043,conferencePaper,CB96XQJP,2020,,1
Anti-interference from Noisy Labels: Mean-Teacher-assisted Confident Learning for Medical Image Segmentation,NO,,,,"Manually segmenting medical images is expertise-demanding, time-consuming and laborious. Acquiring massive high-quality labeled data from experts is often infeasible. Unfortunately, without sufficient high-quality pixel-level labels, the usual data-driven learning-based segmentation methods often struggle with deficient training. As a result, we are often forced to collect additional labeled data from multiple sources with varying label qualities. However, directly introducing additional data with low-quality noisy labels may mislead the network training and undesirably offset the efficacy provided by those high-quality labels. To address this issue, we propose a Mean-Teacher-assisted Confident Learning (MTCL) framework constructed by a teacher-student architecture and a label self-denoising process to robustly learn segmentation from a small set of high-quality labeled data and plentiful low-quality noisy labeled data. Particularly, such a synergistic framework is capable of simultaneously and robustly exploiting (i) the additional dark knowledge inside the images of low-quality labeled set via perturbation-based unsupervised consistency, and (ii) the productive information of their low-quality noisy labels via explicit label refinement. Comprehensive experiments on left atrium segmentation with simulated noisy labels and hepatic and retinal vessel segmentation with real-world noisy labels demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of our approach as well as its effectiveness on label denoising.

Detecting Uncertainty of Mortality Prediction Using Confident Learning,NO,,,,"Early mortality prediction is an actively researched problem that has led to the development of various severity scores and machine learning (ML) models for accurate and reliable detection of mortality in severely ill patients staying in intensive care units (ICUs). However, the uncertainty of such predictions due to irregular patient sampling, missing information, or high diversity of patient data has not yet been adequately addressed. In this paper, we used confident learning (CL) to incorporate sample-uncertainty information into our mortality prediction models and evaluated the performance of these models using a large dataset of 139,367 unique ICU admissions within the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD). The results of our study validate the importance of uncertainty quantification in patient outcome prediction and show that the state-of-the-art ML models augmented with CL are more robust against epistemic error and class imbalance.  2021 IEEE.","Abad, Zahra Shakeri Hossein; Lee, Joon",10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629505,conferencePaper,WQVNUS6X,2021,,1
Resilience Improvements for Space-Based Radio Frequency Machine Learning,NO,,,,"Recent work has quantified the degradations that occur in convolutional neural nets (CNN) deployed in harsh environments like space-based image or radio frequency (RF) processing applications. Such degradations yield a robust correlation and causality between single-event upset (SEU) induced errors in memory weights of on-orbit CNN implementations. However, minimal considerations have been given to how the resilience of CNNs can be improved algorithmically as opposed to via enhanced hardware. This paper focuses on RF-processing CNNs and performs an in-depth analysis of applying software-based error detection and correction mechanisms, which may subsequently be combined with protections of radiation-hardened processor platforms. These techniques are more accessible for low cost smallsat platforms than ruggedized hardware. Additionally, methods for minimizing the memory and computational complexity of the resulting resilience techniques are identified. Combined with periodic scrubbing, the resulting techniques are shown to improve expected lifetimes of CNN-based RF-processing algorithms by several orders of magnitude.","Wong, L.J.; Altland, E.; Detwiler, J.; Fermin, P.; Kuzin, J.M.; Moeliono, N.; Abdalla, A.S.; Headley, W.C.; Michaels, A.J.",10.1109/ISNCC49221.2020.9297212,conferencePaper,JY4XDRZM,2020,,1

Emotion Analysis Model of Microblog Comment Text Based on CNN-BiLSTM,NO,,,,"Aiming at the problems of over reliance on labor and low generalization of traditional emotion analysis methods based on dictionary and machine learning, an emotion analysis model of microblog comment text based on deep learning is proposed. Firstly, text is obtained through microblog crawler program. After data preprocessing, including data cleaning, Chinese word segmentation, removal of stop words, and so on, the Skip-gram model is used for word vector training on a large-scale unmarked corpus, and then the trained word vector is used as the text input of CNN-BiLSTM model, which combines Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Considering the historical context information and the subsequent context information, BiLSTM can better use the temporal relationship of text to learn sentence semantics. CNN can extract hidden features from the text and combine them. Finally, after Adamax optimization training, the emotion type of microblog comment text is output. The proposed model combines the learning advantages of BiLSTM and CNN. The overall accuracy of text emotion analysis has been greatly improved, with an accuracy of 0.94 and an improvement of 8.51% compared with the single CNN model.  2022 Aichuan Li and Shujuan Yi.","Li, Aichuan; Yi, Shujuan",10.1155/2022/1669569,journalArticle,U57UWQSB,2022,,1

Effects of Image Processing Operations on Adversarial Noise and Their Use in Detecting and Correcting Adversarial Images,NO,,,,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance on several tasks and have been widely applied in both academia and industry. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning attacks in which noise is added to the input to change the networks' output. Consequently, DNN-based mission-critical applications such as those used in self-driving vehicles have reduced reliability and could cause severe accidents and damage. Moreover, adversarial examples could be used to poison DNN training data, resulting in corruptions of trained models. Besides the need for detecting adversarial examples, correcting them is important for restoring data and system functionality to normal. We have developed methods for detecting and correcting adversarial images that use multiple image processing operations with multiple parameter values. For detection, we devised a statistical-based method that outperforms the feature squeezing method. For correction, we devised a method that uses for the first time two levels of correction. The first level is label correction, with the focus on restoring the adversarial images' original predicted labels (for use in the current task). The second level is image correction, with the focus on both the correctness and quality of the corrected images (for use in the current and other tasks). Our experiments demonstrated that the correction method could correct nearly 90% of the adversarial images created by classical adversarial attacks and affected only about 2% of the normal images.

A novel deep learning framework for standardizing the label of OARs in CT,NO,,,,"When organs at risk (OARs) are contoured in computed tomography (CT) images for radiotherapy treatment planning, the labels are often inconsistent, which severely hampers the collection and curation of clinical data for research purpose. Currently, data cleaning is mainly done manually, which is time-consuming. The existing methods for automatically relabeling OARs remain unpractical with real patient data, due to the inconsistent delineation and similar small-volume OARs. This paper proposes an improved data augmentation technique according to the characteristics of clinical data. Besides, a novel 3D non-local convolutional neural network is proposed, which includes a decision making network with voting strategy. The resulting model can automatically identify OARs and solve the problems in existing methods, achieving the accurate OAR re-labeling goal. We used partial data from a public head-and-neck dataset (HN_PETCT) for training, and then tested the model on datasets from three different medical institutions. We have obtained the state-of-the-art results for identifying 28 OARs in the head-and-neck region, and also our model is capable of handling multi-center datasets indicating strong generalization ability. Compared to the baseline, the final result of our model achieved a significant improvement in the average true positive rate (TPR) on the three test datasets (+8.27%, +2.39%, +5.53%, respectively). More importantly, the F1 score of small-volume OAR with only 9 training samples increased from 28.63% to 91.17%.

An epistemic approach to model uncertainty in data-graphs,NO,,,,"Graph databases are becoming widely successful as data models that allow to effectively represent and process complex relationships among various types of data. As with any other type of data repository, graph databases may suffer from errors and discrepancies with respect to the real-world data they intend to represent. In this work we explore the notion of probabilistic unclean graph databases, previously proposed for relational databases, in order to capture the idea that the observed (unclean) graph database is actually the noisy version of a clean one that correctly models the world but that we know partially. As the factors that may be involved in the observation can be many, e.g, all different types of clerical errors or unintended transformations of the data, we assume a probabilistic model that describes the distribution over all possible ways in which the clean (uncertain) database could have been polluted. Based on this model we define two computational problems: data cleaning and probabilistic query answering and study for both of them their corresponding complexity when considering that the transformation of the database can be caused by either removing (subset) or adding (superset) nodes and edges.

Method for dataset preparation for soil data analysis in decision support applications,NO,,,,"Nowadays, publically available soil health cards (SHC) are easily understandable and useful means of knowledge transfer about soil conditions to farmers for sustainable soil management in farms. The SHCs are the true representative of precise and useful information about the physicochemical properties and nutrient status of agricultural soil. Before SHCs, the soil test records generally lie with soil test laboratories (STLs) and their availability in form of soil datasets is very limited. Moreover, the datasets are not big enough to be utilized as test datasets in soil investigation and development of futuristic and intelligent decision support and advisory systems. To address the issue, this paper presents a simple method for soil dataset preparation from SHCs for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based soil research and analysis applications. The method collects wide number of SHCs for particular location and applies simple parsing and data cleaning concepts, implemented by utilizing open-source python libraries, to set of SHCs to prepare soil dataset. The dataset prepared by the proposed method can be used in a variety of intelligent data-driven decision support applications such as soil classification, nutrient prediction, and fertilizer recommendation. The dataset thus generated by the proposed method would help both researchers and soil scientists in their future research on soil health monitoring and decision support for sustainable farm management.","Motia, S.; Reddy, S.R.N.",10.1088/1757-899X/1022/1/012104,conferencePaper,6XCW43Q9,2021,,1

EnAli: entity alignment across multiple heterogeneous data sources,NO,,,,"Entity alignment is the problem of identifying which entities in a data source refer to the same real-world entity in the others. Identifying entities across heterogeneous data sources is paramount to many research fields, such as data cleaning, data integration, information retrieval and machine learning. The aligning process is not only overwhelmingly expensive for large data sources since it involves all tuples from two or more data sources, but also need to handle heterogeneous entity attributes. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach, called EnAli, to match entities across two or more heterogeneous data sources. EnAli employs a generative probabilistic model to incorporate the heterogeneous entity attributes via employing exponential family, handle missing values, and also utilize the locality sensitive hashing schema to reduce the candidate tuples and speed up the aligning process. EnAli is highly accurate and efficient even without any ground-truth tuples. We illustrate the performance of EnAli on re-identifying entities from the same data source, as well as aligning entities across three real data sources.

Diabetic retinopathy classification using VGG16 neural network,NO,,,,"Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy is one of the main complications of diabetes mellitus. To assess the progression of the disease, retinal images are commonly obtained through fundus examination. However, those images may present problems such as low contrast, inadequate lighting, and unsatisfactory noise level, among other aspects that can compromise medical analysis and intervention. In this context, this work aims to apply the neural network VGG16 to classify the diabetic retinopathy in 5 categories and with an additional class (named class 5) to report low quality of digital retinal images publicly available in the DDR, EyePACS/Kaggle, and IDRiD databases. Methods: The proposed methodology includes pre-processing of retinal images, consisting of size adequacy, data cleaning (the removal of low-quality images from other classes and inclusion of them in class 5), data augmentation and class balancing during the training phase, and hyperparameter adjustment and image classification using the VGG16 neural network.

EBOD: An ensemble-based outlier detection algorithm for noisy datasets,NO,,,,"Real-world datasets often comprise outliers (e.g., due to operational error, intrinsic variability of the measurements, recording mistakes, etc.) and, hence, require cleansing as a prerequisite to any meaningful machine learning analysis. However, data cleansing is often a laborious task that requires intuition or expert knowledge. In particular, selecting an outlier detection algorithm is challenging as this choice is dataset-specific and depends on the nature of the considered dataset. These difficulties have prevented the development of a ""one-fits-all"" approach for the cleansing of real-world, noisy datasets. Here, we present an unsupervised, ensemble-based outlier detection (EBOD) approach that considers the union of different outlier detection algorithms, wherein each of the selected detectors is only responsible for identifying a small number of outliers that are the most obvious from their respective standpoints. The use of an ensemble of weak detectors reduces the risk of bias during outlier detection as compared to using a single detector. The optimal combination of detectors is determined by forwardbackward search. By taking the example of a noisy dataset of concrete strength measurements as well as a broad collection of benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our EBOD method systematically outperforms all alternative detectors, when used individually or in combination. Based on this new outlier detection method, we explore how data cleansing affects the complexity, training, and accuracy of an artificial neural network.  2021 The Authors","Ouyang, Boya; Song, Yu; Li, Yuhai; Sant, Gaurav; Bauchy, Mathieu",10.1016/j.knosys.2021.107400,journalArticle,998U7MJW,2021,,1

Deep API Learning Revisited,NO,,,,"Understanding the correct API usage sequences is one of the most important tasks for programmers when they work with unfamiliar libraries. However, programmers often encounter obstacles to finding the appropriate information due to either poor quality of API documentation or ineffective query-based searching strategy. To help solve this issue, researchers have proposed various methods to suggest the sequence of APIs given natural language queries representing the information needs from programmers. Among such efforts, Gu et al. adopted a deep learning method, in particular an RNN Encoder-Decoder architecture, to perform this task and obtained promising results on common APIs in Java. In this work, we aim to reproduce their results and apply the same methods for APIs in Python. Additionally, we compare the performance with a more recent Transformer-based method, i.e., CodeBERT, for the same task. Our experiment reveals a clear drop in performance measures when careful data cleaning is performed. Owing to the pretraining from a large number of source code files and effective encoding technique, CodeBERT outperforms the method by Gu et al., to a large extent. Copyright  2022, The Authors.

Active label cleaning for improved dataset quality under resource constraints,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,label,"Imperfections in data annotation, known as label noise, are detrimental to the training of machine learning models and have a confounding effect on the assessment of model performance. Nevertheless, employing experts to remove label noise by fully re-annotating large datasets is infeasible in resource-constrained settings, such as healthcare. This work advocates for a data-driven approach to prioritising samples for re-annotation-which we term ""active label cleaning"". We propose to rank instances according to estimated label correctness and labelling difficulty of each sample, and introduce a simulation framework to evaluate relabelling efficacy.

A hybrid machine learning model for short-term estimated time of arrival prediction in terminal manoeuvring area,NO,,,,"4D trajectory prediction is the core element of future air transportation system, which is intended to improve the operational ability and the predictability of air traffic. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model to address the short-term trajectory prediction problem in Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) by application of machine learning methods. The proposed model consists of two parts: clustering-based preprocessing and Multi-Cells Neural Network (MCNN)-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering and data re-sampling, we applied principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of trajectory vector variable. Then, the trajectories are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using nested cross validation, MCNN model is trained to find out the appropriate prediction model of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each individual cluster cell. Finally, the predicted ETA for each new flight is generated in different cluster cells classified by decision trees. To assess the performance of MCNN model, the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is proposed as the comparison learning model, and K-means++ and DBSCAN are proposed as two comparison clustering models in preprocessing part. With real 4D trajectory data in Beijing TMA, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model MCNN with DBSCAN in preprocessing is the most effective and robust hybrid machine learning model, both in trajectory clustering and short-term 4D trajectory prediction. In addition, it can make an accurate trajectory prediction in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with regards to comparison models.  2018 Elsevier Ltd","Wang, Zhengyi; Liang, Man; Delahaye, Daniel",10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.019,journalArticle,4TLDHUZY,2018,,1
Global macroevolution and macroecology of passerine song,NO,,,,"Studying the macroevolution of the songs of Passeriformes (perching birds) has proved challenging. The complexity of the task stems not just from the macroevolutionary and macroecological challenge of modeling so many species, but also from the difficulty in collecting and quantifying birdsong itself. Using machine learning techniques, we extracted songs from a large citizen science dataset, and then analyzed the evolution, and biotic and abiotic predictors of variation in birdsong across 578 passerine species. Contrary to expectations, we found few links between life-history traits (monogamy and sexual dimorphism) and the evolution of song pitch (peak frequency) or song complexity (standard deviation of frequency). However, we found significant support for morphological constraints on birdsong, as reflected in a negative correlation between bird size and song pitch. We also found that broad-scale biogeographical and climate factors such as net primary productivity, temperature, and regional species richness were significantly associated with both the evolution and present-day distribution of bird song features. Our analysis integrates comparative and spatial modeling with newly developed data cleaning and curation tools, and suggests that evolutionary history, morphology, and present-day ecological processes shape the distribution of song diversity in these charismatic and important birds.","Pearse, WD; Morales-Castilla, I; James, LS; Farrell, M; Boivin, F; Davies, TJ",10.1111/evo.13450,journalArticle,VSNBCZ3W,2018,,1
RNN-assisted network coding for secure heterogeneous Internet of Things with unreliable storage,NO,,,,"With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT), integrating a variety of IoT can result in novel applications. However, IoT devices are often deployed in an open environment where IoT are inclined to be malfunctioned. Although data reliability can be achieved by data recovery with conventional replication, the communication between IoT is susceptible to eavesdropping. Therefore, in this paper, we study the eavesdropping prevention of data repair in IoT environments based on network coding. We theoretically derive the relation between security level and storage in heterogeneous IoT systems. To further reduce the repair bandwidth, we exploit recurrent neural network for the storage failure prediction. Under the condition when failure probability and workloads of storage devices are considered, two allocation algorithms are proposed to avoid data repair. Finally, we show the relation between storage cost and reliability with different numbers of IoT devices. Experimental results manifest that the proposed allocation algorithms can outperform the baseline case by 18.4% in terms of the security level.",Chen-Hung Liao; Hong-Han Shuai; Li-Chun Wang,10.1109/JIOT.2019.2902376,journalArticle,PHNGG3UL,2019,,1

Learning from time-synchronized power system measurements with rare anomalous event records to detect PMU data manipulation attacks,NO,,,,"PMU data manipulation attacks (DMA) which maliciously modify the synchrophasor measurements in power systems, is an emerging type of cyber-attack aiming to mislead the control center into taking erroneous control actions. Widespread application of PMU produces a vast amount of time-synchronized historical operating data, making it possible to turn to machine learning approaches to detect the attacks. However, anomalous events occur rarely in practice. To construct a balanced training dataset, where normal and anomalous instances need to be evenly extracted and labeled from historical operating records, is sure to cost plenty of human efforts and may introduce uncontrollable experience errors. In this paper, we design a novel detection model with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE)-based data augmentation and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)-based data cleaning technique to reconstruct the imbalanced training dataset into a balanced one to train the subsequent XGBoost classifier. Experiments show that although rare anomalous historical event records are needed, our model is still able to effectively detect out DMAs in power systems.",J. Wang; D.

Probabilistic Modeling for Novelty Detection with Applications to Fraud Identification [arXiv],NO,,,,"Novelty detection is the unsupervised problem of identifying anomalies in test data which significantly differ from the training set. Novelty detection is one of the classic challenges in Machine Learning and a core component of several research areas such as fraud detection, intrusion detection, medical diagnosis, data cleaning, and fault prevention. While numerous algorithms were designed to address this problem, most methods are only suitable to model continuous numerical data. Tackling datasets composed of mixed-type features, such as numerical and categorical data, or temporal datasets describing discrete event sequences is a challenging task. In addition to the supported data types, the key criteria for efficient novelty detection methods are the ability to accurately dissociate novelties from nominal samples, the interpretability, the scalability and the robustness to anomalies located in the training data. In this thesis, we investigate novel ways to tackle these issues. In particular, we propose (i) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for mixed-type data (ii) an experimental comparison of novelty detection methods for sequence data, (iii) a probabilistic nonparametric novelty detection method for mixed-type data based on Dirichlet process mixtures and exponential-family distributions and (iv) an autoencoder-based novelty detection model with encoder/decoder modelled as deep Gaussian processes. We first propose to model mixed -type features with a nonparametric mixture of exponential family distributions. The resulting algorithm is a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model. We compare this method against a wide set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection. The selected methods are benchmarked on publicly available datasets and novel industrial datasets from the company Amadeus. We further run extensive scalability, memory consumption and robustness tests in order to build a full overview of the algorithms characteristics.","Domingues, R.",,journalArticle,D8CT2X4G,2019,,1

Integration of petrophysical log data with computational intelligence forthe development of a lithology predictor,NO,,,,"Wrong manual interpretation from the log data about the formation type and other important information canbe catastrophic for the company-operator. With Machine-Learning (ML) (a branch of Artificial Intelligence)algorithms, the interpretation of formation type from the log data has been addressed. As a result, we havesuccessfully developed a program able to accurately predict the type of formation. Using the conventional Machine Learning technique of splitting the data into training, validation andtest sets, we tried six different ML algorithms to fit with the training part of the data and then verifytheir prediction accuracy with cross-validation scores and cross-validation predictions which tests theperformance of the classifiers (ML algorithms) on the validation set. The three best performing classifierswere selected and further improved by a search of classifier's best hyperparameters. These improvedclassifiers are further tested on unseen data to produce a comparative analysis. Our prediction accuracy with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) scores and ROC-Area Under-the-Curve (ROC-AUC) for each type of formation from the log data lies in the range of 95-99%, exceptfor formations such as shaly sandstone and shale (50% and 84% respectively). The reason for this seemedto be under-fitting i.e., during the training, the classifiers did not see enough instances of these types offormation to know exactly what characteristics of the data make the type of formation to be shaly sandstoneor shale. The issue of under-fitting was verified by skimming through the data. To resolve this problem, we suggest training classifiers with a larger data with more targets (types of formation). Furthermore, during the data cleaning (prior to classifier training) and data analysis phases we have discovered importantrelationships between well logs and defined relative importance of each well log for different formations.This observation can be investigated further to help eliminate the use of multiple well logs while dealing withsome formations (based on prior geological knowledge) and reduce the cost of the well logging operations.Using our program with a larger well log data consisting of more formation type instances, we can train theclassifiers to accurately predict the formation type irrespectively of differences in formation type. Our program is dynamic in the sense that with different targets, i.e., type of formation fluid instead oftype of formation or both together, it can successfully predict either or both targets. Increasing the numbers of data instances resulted in a better training and thus, more accurate predictions. Utilization of the programwill make the formation-evaluation process easier, faster, automated and more-precise.

Iterative label cleaning for transductive and semi-supervised few-shot learning,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,label,"Few-shot learning amounts to learning representations and acquiring knowledge such that novel tasks may be solved with both supervision and data being limited. Improved performance is possible by transductive inference, where the entire test set is available concurrently, and semi-supervised learning, where more unlabeled data is available. These problems are closely related because there is little or no adaptation of the representation in novel tasks. Focusing on these two settings, we introduce a new algorithm that leverages the manifold structure of the labeled and unlabeled data distribution to predict pseudo-labels, while balancing over classes and using the loss value distribution of a limited-capacity classifier to select the cleanest labels, iterately improving the quality of pseudo-labels.

Next, two data sets have been established, containing 575 facial motor nerve conduction study reports and 233 auditory brainstem response reports, respectively.

The performance comparisons of accuracy and recall rate among different algorithms indicate that the random forest algorithm has the optimal performance over the other two in both data sets. Moreover, the comparisons have been carried out in the cases with and without deviation standardization for each algorithm, and the results demonstrate that the deviation standardization has a certain effect on the accuracy improvement. Additionally, it is found that the random forest algorithm can present the ranking of the features in order of importance. Consequently, the random forest is proven to be an optimal algorithm for computer-aided diagnosis systems.

LIMA: Fine-grained Lineage Tracing and Reuse in Machine Learning Systems,related,,,,"Machine learning (ML) and data science workflows are inherently exploratory. Data scientists pose hypotheses, integrate the necessary data, and run ML pipelines of data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The repetitive nature of these workflows, and their hierarchical composition from building blocks exhibits high computational redundancy. Existing work addresses this redundancy with coarse-grained lineage tracing and reuse for ML pipelines. This approach allows using existing ML systems, but views entire algorithms as black boxes, and thus, fails to eliminate fine-grained redundancy and to handle internal non-determinism. In this paper, we introduce LIMA, a practical framework for efficient, fine-grained lineage tracing and reuse inside ML systems. Lineage tracing of individual operations creates new challenges and opportunities. We address the large size of lineage traces with multi-level lineage tracing and reuse, as well as lineage deduplication for loops and functions; exploit full and partial reuse opportunities across the program hierarchy; and integrate this framework with task parallelism and operator fusion. The resulting framework performs fine-grained lineage tracing with low overhead, provides versioning and reproducibility, and is able to eliminate fine-grained redundancy.

Parcellating Speech Networks Using Connectivity and Multivariate Meta-Analysis,NO,,,,"A densely interconnected patchwork of cortical areas tiles the brain, balancing the integration and segregation of functions. The eminent strategy for charting the functions of this landscape has involved pinning tightly controlled behavioral tasks onto large and often isolated patches of cortex in piecemeal. Recent developments have made it possible to study the organization of this rich functional landscape from the bottom-up, by mapping the connectivity networks that underpin brain areas situated within larger functional regions. At the same time, the availability of large databases that aggregate published functional neuroimaging work make it possible to infer the functions of such connectivity-defined areas from a much broader behavioral space than can be accessed by any individual study. In the first study of the present work, this bottom-up approach was leveraged to elucidate functional organization around the planum temporale (PT), an anatomical region that has been shown to be critical to speech production, but which has also been associated with a variety of other functions in functional neuroimaging studies. Functional connectivity estimated from multiecho resting state data (N =137) was used to map areas within the posterior perisylvian zone that functional neuroimaging studies have associated with the PT. A deliberate parcellation of this zone was produced by forming cluster ensembles from complementary unsupervised learning algorithms that produced reliable parcellations (12 clustering approaches were tested for their reliability). The resulting parcellation was well-aligned with observer-independent architectonic work, and even outperformed several popular atlases when used to classify external data. Registering the networks and areas within this parcellation to published functional neuroimaging work revealed that the functional zone associated with the PT was comprised of multiple speech areas, including an area involved in rehearsal and an area involved in production. Further, multiple areas were associated with receptive speech, auditory, and sensorimotor processing. At a broad level, a second study tested the extent to which there can be agreement between areas defined from the bottom-up based on connectivity data, and functional areas embedded in published neuroimaging work. That is, a parcellation of temporal and inferior parietal cortex based on structural connectivity (N = 70) was compared to a parcellation resulting from the same clustering approach adapted to brain-behavior associations (i.e., meta-analyses of behaviors). This functional parcellation carved out areas with similar behavioral profiles and was implemented in the service of localizing areas involved in speech perception. Prior meta-analytic studies with the same goal have used sample sizes now known to be insufficient, produced incompatible results, and failed to consider whether speech responsive areas are involved in other functions. Clustering was performed over lower-dimensional functional networks extracted from brain-behavior associations. Auditory and speech processes were robustly distinguished irrespective of how many functional networks were defined. A more optimal set of functional networks showed evidence of a posteriorly directed speech processing hierarchy that implicated an area in ventral superior temporal gyrus, posterior to auditory cortex, in speech sound analysis. The functional parcellation isolated areas along this speech hierarchy and captured the extent to which they were shared across functional networks. Overall, there was significant spatial correspondence between the functional and structural parcellations, and the parcel associated with speech sound processing showed the best fit to structural connectivity data. Structural data indicated that this parcel could be distinguished based on its strong connectivity along the middle longitudinal fasciculus. A third study investigated a more targeted hypothesis about the role of pMTG in error correction. The results of this study helped better characterize the function of one of two areas from the functional parcellation presented in the second study that were both associated with the pMTG, but difficult to functionally distinguish in a precise way. Previous work has demonstrated suggestive evidence of internal error detection and correction in left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) on the basis that this area tended toward showing a stronger response when potential speech errors (i.e., not realized) are biased towards nonwords compared to words. Building on this prior work, an experiment was designed introducing novel tongue twister stimuli that attempted to further tax internal error correction and detection mechanisms by biasing potential speech errors towards taboo words. Although the pMTG demonstrated significantly greater response to taboo words than neutral words in a large sample of participants (N=40), other areas also showed an effect. Behavioral associations in the wider neuroimaging literature were used to better understand the functional significance of activity outside the pMTG, demonstrating that only activity within this area was likely to signal word-level processing, and therefore explain the internal error correction mechanism investigated. Taken together, these studies present a more nuanced description of the functional and structural networks underpinning the speech system and point to more specific functions that these networks may support.

Characterizing label errors: Confident learning for noisy-labeled image segmentation,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,label,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in image processing for its mighty capability to fit huge amount of data. However, if the training data are corrupted by noisy labels, the resulting performance might be deteriorated. In the domain of medical image analysis, this dilemma becomes extremely severe. This is because the medical image annotation always requires medical expertise and clinical experience, which would inevitably introduce subjectivity. In this paper, we design a novel algorithm based on the teacher-student architecture for noisy-labeled medical image segmentation. Creatively, We introduce confident learning (CL) method to identify the corrupted labels and endow CNN an anti-interference ability to the noises. Specifically, the CL technique is introduced to the teacher model to characterize the suspected wrong-labeled pixels. Since the noise identification maps are a little away from sufficient precision, the spatial label smoothing regularization technique is utilized to generate soft-corrected masks for training the student model. Since our method identifies and revises the noisy labels of the training data in a pixel-level rather than simply assigns lower weights to the noisy masks, it outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the noisy-labeled image segmentation task on the JSRT dataset, especially when the training data are severely corrupted by noises.

Large-scale real-world radio signal recognition with deep learning,NO,,,,"In the past ten years, many high-quality datasets have been released to support the rapid development of deep learning in the fields of computer vision, voice, and natural language processing. Nowadays, deep learning has become a key research component of the Sixth-Generation wireless systems (6G) with numerous regulatory and defense applications. In order to facilitate the application of deep learning in radio signal recognition, in this work, a large-scale real-world radio signal dataset is created based on a special aeronautical monitoring system - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). This paper makes two main contributions. First, an automatic data collection and labeling system is designed to capture over-the-air ADS-B signals in the open and real-world scenario without human participation. Through data cleaning and sorting, a high-quality dataset of ADS-B signals is created for radio signal recognition. Second, we conduct an in-depth study on the performance of deep learning models using the new dataset, as well as comparison with a recognition benchmark using machine learning and deep learning methods.

Optimal pre-processing to achieve fairness and its relationship with total variation barycenter,related,,,,"We use disparate impact, i.e., the extent that the probability of observing an output depends on protected attributes such as race and gender, to measure fairness. We prove that disparate impact is upper bounded by the total variation distance between the distribution of the inputs given the protected attributes. We then use pre-processing, also known as data repair, to enforce fairness. We show that utility degradation, i.e., the extent that the success of a forecasting model changes by pre-processing the data, is upper bounded by the total variation distance between the distribution of the data before and after pre-processing. Hence, the problem of finding the optimal pre-processing regiment for enforcing fairness can be cast as minimizing total variations distance between the distribution of the data before and after pre-processing subject to a constraint on the total variation distance between the distribution of the inputs given protected attributes. This problem is a linear program that can be efficiently solved. We show that this problem is intimately related to finding the barycenter (i.e., center of mass) of two distributions when distances in the probability space are measured by total variation distance. We also investigate the effect of differential privacy on fairness using the proposed the total variation distances. We demonstrate the results using numerical experimentation with a practice dataset. Copyright  2021, The Authors. All rights reserved.","Farokhi, Farhad",,journalArticle,66UPFXW2,2021,,1

Efficient heart disease prediction-based on optimal feature selection using DFCSS and classification by improved Elman-SFO,NO,,,,"Prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. In this study, an efficient heart disease prediction is developed based on optimal feature selection. Initially, the data pre-processing process is performed using data cleaning, data transformation, missing values imputation, and data normalisation. Then the decision function-based chaotic salp swarm (DFCSS) algorithm is used to select the optimal features in the feature selection process. Then the chosen attributes are given to the improved Elman neural network (IENN) for data classification. Here, the sailfish optimisation (SFO) algorithm is used to compute the optimal weight value of IENN. The combination of DFCSS-IENN-based SFO (IESFO) algorithm effectively predicts heart disease. The proposed (DFCSS-IESFO) approach is implemented in the Python environment using two different datasets such as the University of California Irvine (UCI) Cleveland heart disease dataset and CVD dataset. The simulation results proved that the proposed scheme achieved a high-classification accuracy of 98.7% for the CVD dataset and 98% for the UCI dataset compared to other classifiers, such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbour, Elman neural network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree.","Wankhede, J.; Kumar, M.; Sambandam, P.",10.1049/iet-syb.2020.0041,journalArticle,GU5TRYTK,2020,,1

However, the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms is very sensitive to multiple ingredients (e.g.,hyper-parameters tuning and data cleaning) where a significant human effort is required to achieve good results. Thus, building well-performing machine learning algorithms requires domain knowledge and highly specialized data scientists. Automated machine learning (autoML) aims to make easier and more accessible the use of machine learning algorithms for researchers with varying levels of expertise.

Distributed intrusion detection system in the cloud environment based on Apache Kafka and Apache Spark,NO,,,,"After, the emergence of cloud computing (CC), it’s gained more attraction to be used for organizations and users.

Nearest neighbor classifiers over incomplete information: From certain answers to certain predictions,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,features,"Machine learning (ML) applications have been thriving recently, largely attributed to the increasing availability of data. However, inconsistency and incomplete information are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, and their impact on ML applications remains elusive. In this paper, we present a formal study of this impact by extending the notion of Certain Answers for Codd tables, which has been explored by the database research community for decades, into the field of machine learning. Specifically, we focus on classification problems and propose the notion of ""Certain Predictions"" (CP) - a test data example can be certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of all possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same prediction. We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines whether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the number of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given that general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without assumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP queries can be developed - we show that it is possible to answer both queries in linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds. We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of ""data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML)."" We show that our proposed CPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of classification accuracy with mild manual cleaning effort.

FAIR1M: A Benchmark Dataset for Fine-grained Object Recognition in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery [arXiv],NO,,,,"With the rapid development of deep learning, many deep learning-based approaches have made great achievements in object detection task. It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven method. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some limitations in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale benchmark on object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 sub-categories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the quantity of instances and the quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution, (4) it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel evaluation method and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a visual classification task using several State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep learning-based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results strongly indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is considerably more challenging than existing datasets.","Xian Sun; Peijin Wang; Zhiyuan Yan; Feng Xu; Ruiping Wang; Wenhui Diao; Jin Chen; Jihao Li; Yingchao Feng; Tao Xu; Weinmann, M.; Hinz, S.; Cheng Wang; Kun Fu",,journalArticle,S4IB7QJS,2021,,1

Accurate COVID-19 Health Outcome Prediction and Risk Factors Identification through an Innovative Machine Learning Framework Using Longitudinal Electronic Health Records,NO,,,,"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that has caused a worldwide pandemic and put a strain on the global healthcare systems. To better protect and treat higher risk individuals and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems, it is crucial to identify risk factors and build accurate predictive models for COVID-19 related health outcomes. However, current predictive models focus on predicting the risk of mortality, and rely on COVID-19 specific medical data such as CT scans and COVID-19 lab tests results after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. To address these issues, we developed an innovative supervised machine learning framework using synthetic veteran Electronic Health Records (EHR) which were routinely collected during past clinic visits. Our models accurately predicted COVID-19 related health outcomes including mortality, ventilation, days in hospital or ICU. In particular, we developed a series of unique and effective data processing algorithms, including data cleaning, vector representation, initial feature screening. Then we trained models using state-of-the-art machine learning strategies combined with different parameter settings. Our machine learning pipeline not only consistently outperformed those developed by other research groups using the same set of EHR, but also achieved similar accuracy as those trained on medical data that were only available after COVID-19 diagnosis. In addition, top risk factors for COVID-19 were identified, which include age, diabetes, metabolic syndromes, heart disease, kidney disease etc., and are consistent with epidemiology findings. Built on veteran's EHR, our results were especially relevant to veterans and filled in the gap of missing COVID-19 research for veterans who are at much higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness than the general population. This project also demonstrated that longitudinal EHR data can be successfully leveraged to provide a holistic prediction of an individual's health risk based on past health records, which is critical for controlling emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.  2021 IEEE.","Feng, Alice",10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00099,conferencePaper,RXZLPHG3,2021,,1

Differentiation Between Anteroposterior and Posteroanterior Chest X-Ray View Position With Convolutional Neural Networks,NO,,,,"Purpose Detection and validation of the chest X-ray view position with use of convolutional neural networks to improve meta-information for data cleaning within a hospital data infrastructure. Material and Methods Within this paper we developed a convolutional neural network which automatically detects the anteroposterior and posteroanterior view position of a chest radiograph. We trained two different network architectures (VGG variant and ResNet-34) with data published by the RSNA (26 684 radiographs, class distribution 46 % AP, 54 % PA) and validated these on a self-compiled dataset with data from the University Hospital Essen (4507, radiographs, class distribution 55% PA, 45% AP) labeled by a human reader. For visualization and better understanding of the network predictions, a Grad-CAM was generated for each network decision. The network results were evaluated based on the accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC), and the F1-score against the human reader labels. Also a final performance comparison between model predictions and DICOM labels was performed. Results The ensemble models reached accuracy and F1-scores greater than 95%. The AUC reaches more than 0.99 for the ensemble models. The Grad-CAMs provide insight as to which anatomical structures contributed to a decision by the networks which are comparable with the ones a radiologist would use. Furthermore, the trained models were able to generalize over mislabeled examples, which was found by comparing the human reader labels to the predicted labels as well as the DICOM labels. Conclusion The results show that certain incorrectly entered meta-information of radiological images can be effectively corrected by deep learning in order to increase data quality in clinical application as well as in research.","Hosch, R; Kroll, L; Nensa, F; Koitka, S",10.1055/a-1183-5227,journalArticle,DMD8C4WN,2021,,1

Cloud-Edge-End Intelligence for Fault-tolerant Renewable Energy Accommodation in Smart Grid,NO,,,,"Smart grid integrates the distributed energy resources such as renewable energy with massive information to facilitate the flow of energy in the industries. The renewable energy accommodation is one of the key issues to achieve the energy efficiency in smart grid, which is difficult to obtain dynamic optimal policies due to the intermittency of renewables. To capture statuses of renewable energy for decision-making, large amounts of information in heterogeneous forms are collected by massive end devices deployed in smart grid. Such information not only provides fruitful features for existing learning based algorithms but also incurs high computation complexity. Besides, such heterogeneous data may also contain missing values, which may result in wrong policies by existing algorithms. In this paper, a novel cloud-edge-end orchestrated computing scheme is proposed to efficiently repair missing values and obtain optimal policies in two separate layers. In the first layer, deep learning based algorithms deployed can perceive the characteristics and repair the missing values. In the second layer, deep reinforcement learning based algorithms are employed to obtain optimal policies. Simulations on the real power grid dataset illustrate the effectiveness of proposed fault-tolerant renewable energy accommodation algorithm.

Road Network Data Repair Based on Graph Autoencoder-generative Adversarial Network,NO,,,,"The completeness of the traffic and road network data affects the operation of the intelligent transportation systems. This paper proposes a method based on graph autoencoder-generative adversarial network to repair the missing data in the road network. First, the spatiotemporal features of the missing road network data are extracted through the denoising graph variational autoencoder which captures the original road network information to the greatest extent. Then, based on the spatial-temporal features, the study uses the generative adversarial network to generate repaired road network data, adds reconstruction Loss, and optimizes the objective function of the generation of the confrontation network. The effective interpolation of missing data is then realized. This study uses the Seattle (Seattle) and California (PEMS04) road network speed datasets to conduct comparative experiments on data restoration with different missing types and missing rates. When the random missing rate is between 10% and 70%, the mean absolute error(MAE) index of the Seattle dataset is between 2.38 and 3.25. The MAE index of the PEMS04 data set is between 1.46 and 2.38. When the aggregated missing rate is between 10% and 70%, the MAE index of the Seattle data set is between 2.51 and 2.82. The MAE index of the PEMS04 data set is between 1.52 and 1.54.

Chef: A cheap and fast pipeline for iteratively cleaning label uncertainties,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",?,label,"High-quality labels are expensive to obtain for many machine learning tasks, such as medical image classification tasks. Therefore, probabilistic (weak) labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called Chef (CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than one big batch of samples. This yields better overall model performance and enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Implementation of Indexing Techniques to Prevent Data Leakage and Duplication in Internet,NO,,,,"Research in this area aims to create a new and efficient method for detecting near-duplicates in online content. Web pages that a search engine has scoured are first parsed to remove HTML elements and java scripts. After this phase, remove common keywords or stop words from the crawled pages. The affixes (prefix and suffix) from crawled pages are drawn by extracting keywords from the text. Finally, the collected keywords generate the similarity score between two papers. This research has proved that the suggested algorithms outperform earlier ones by conducting an extensive experimental investigation on several actual datasets. New algorithms outperform those already in use, according to the test findings. Since there are so many documents on the internet, web search engines have had difficulty finding relevant results for their customers. Overhead costs for search engines have risen dramatically due to an overabundance of almost similar or identical documents somehow. The web crawling community has long been aware of duplicate and near-identical online pages. Users want search engines to return relevant results for their searches on the first page, free of duplicates and redundancies. This is an important criterion. An essential enabler in the health industry is record or data linking, as connected data is an economic resource that may aid enhance research into health policy, detecting bad medication responses, and cutting expenses while uncovering health system fraud. Recent years have seen significant progress in several record linking approaches, mostly due to breakthroughs in data mining and machine learning. Most of these novel technologies have not yet been incorporated in current record linking systems or are disguised in commercial software as 'black boxes.' When it comes to learning about new record linking strategies and comparing old methods with new ones, this makes it difficult for users to do so. Innovative record-linking systems must be tested and implemented at low costs using flexible tools. FEBRL (Freely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage), a free, open-source software license system, is described in this work. Data cleansing and standardization, indexing (blocking), field comparisons, and record pair categorization are all included in this user-friendly graphical interface. When used as a training tool, practitioners may use Febrl to connect data sets with up to several hundred thousand records and learn about both old and novel description linking approaches.  2022 IEEE.","Nalini, M.K.; Dhinakaran, K.; Elantamilan, D.; Gnanavel, R.; Vinod, D.",10.1109/ACCAI53970.2022.9752554,conferencePaper,VDIADKFT,2022,,1
A multi-classifier framework for open source malware forensics,NO,,,,"Traditional anti-virus technologies have failed to keep pace with proliferation of malware due to slow process of their signatures and heuristics updates. Similarly, there are limitations of time and resources in order to perform manual analysis on each malware. There is a need to learn from this vast quantity of data, containing cyber attack pattern, in an automated manner to proactively adapt to ever-evolving threats. Machine learning offers unique advantages to learn from past cyber attacks to handle future cyber threats. The purpose of this research is to propose a framework for multi-classification of malware into well-known categories by applying different machine learning models over corpus of malware analysis reports. These reports are generated through an open source malware sandbox in an automated manner. We applied extensive pre-modeling techniques for data cleaning, features exploration and features engineering to prepare training and test datasets. Best possible hyper-parameters are selected to build machine learning models. These prepared datasets are then used to train the machine learning classifiers and to compare their prediction accuracy. Finally, these results are validated through a comprehensive 10-fold cross-validation methodology. The best results are achieved through Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier with random accuracy of 96% and 10-Fold Cross Validation accuracy of 91.2%.

Data Cleaning for Wind Turbine Systems Based on Iterative learning and Neural Network,Specific,,,,"The power curve is an important indicator for evaluating the power generation performance of wind turbine systems. Equipment failure and human intervention are the main factors leading abnormal data of power curve, resulting in serious deterioration of the data availability. In order to solve the negative impact of abnormal data, a novel data cleaning framework is proposed for wind turbine systems. First, the nonlinear regression model between the wind speed and the power is established by the back propagation (BP) neural network. Then, the distances between the real data and the nonlinear regression model are approximated by employing the designed auxiliary points. The candidate abnormal data and the current normal data are separated by a threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in descending order. At the same time, based on the set of candidate abnormal data, the candidate normal data is selected through another threshold judgment strategy after sorting all the distances in ascending order. On the basic of both the current normal data and the candidate normal data, the neural network based on iterative learning is applied to update the nonlinear regression model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified upon two sets of data collected by real wind turbine systems.",Y. Shen; S. Dong; Q. Wu; F.

MegaDepth: Learning Single-View Depth Prediction from Internet Photos,NO,,,,"Single-view depth prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, deep learning methods have led to significant progress, but such methods are limited by the available training data. Current datasets based on 3D sensors have key limitations, including indoor-only images (NYU), small numbers of training examples (Make3D), and sparse sampling (KITTI). We propose to use multi-view Internet photo collections, a virtually unlimited data source, to generate training data via modern structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo (MVS) methods, and present a large depth dataset called MegaDepth based on this idea. Data derived from MVS comes with its own challenges, including noise and unreconstructable objects. We address these challenges with new data cleaning methods, as well as automatically augmenting our data with ordinal depth relations generated using semantic segmentation. We validate the use of large amounts of Internet data by showing that models trained on MegaDepth exhibit strong generalization-not only to novel scenes, but also to other diverse datasets including Make3D, KITTI, and DIW, even when no images from those datasets are seen during training.","Zhengqi Li; Snavely, N.",10.1109/CVPR.2018.00218,conferencePaper,325EFW2X,2018,,1

Data-blind ML: building privacy-aware machine learning models without direct data access,NO,,,,"Traditional Machine Learning (ML) pipeline development requires the ML practitioner to directly access the data to analyze, clean and preprocess it, in order to develop an ML model, train it and evaluate its performance. When the data owner has no infrastructure for in-house development, such pipelines are outsourced. It is common that data has some level of privacy constraints that will impose a laborious and maybe expensive infrastructure, including among others contracts drafting and infrastructure improvement. Traditional approaches rely either on anonymization which does not entirely protect from identity disclosure, or on synthetic data generation which requires expertise not necessarily available to the organization. In this paper, we present Data-Blind ML, an automated framework, fueled by synthetic generative learning and distributed computing paradigms, which enables an organization to outsource the development and training of ML models without sharing any sample from the real dataset. In addition, the framework allows the ML practitioner to get feedback of the model's performance against the actual real data without accessing it directly.","Pastorino, J.; Biswas, A.K.",10.1109/AIKE52691.2021.00020,conferencePaper,4FXDDC4C,2021,,1

An interpretable method for identifying mislabeled commercial building based on temporal feature extraction and ensemble classifier,Specific,,,,"Proper building categorization is important in building energy efficiency analysis. Primary space usage (PSU) is a typical and widely used commercial building categorization method. The PSU labels are ascertained once the buildings are put into use but not always modified on time when the building usages change, which may lead to false results in analysis. In this paper, we propose a method to identify mislabeled commercial buildings based on analysis of the energy time series collected by electric meters. The method is constructed as follows: (1) data cleaning and transformation; (2) three types of temporal feature extraction; (3) several single classifier training, and the ensemble classifier building; (4) mislabel building identification and correction. The method provides a supervise way to identify mislabeled building. We applied the method to a public dataset from the Department of General Services from Washington, D.C. and found that 22.4% of the buildings were mislabeled. We also designed 1000 evaluation cases to prove the effectiveness of the method. Based on the results of the cases and the good interpretation of the method, we discuss the mislabeled buildings in reality and the temporal differences among different PSU-type buildings. We also discuss the renewal or improvement of PSU categorization.","Xiao, Tong; Xu, Peng; Ding, Renrong; Chen, Zhe",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103635,journalArticle,IWW3ZG78,2022,,1

Cell Segmentation Using a Similarity Interface with a Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network,NO,,,,"Even though convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used for cell segmentation, they require pixel-level ground truth annotations. This paper proposes a multitask learning algorithm for cell detection and segmentation using CNNs. We use dot annotations placed inside each cell indicating approximate cell centroids to create training datasets for the detection and segmentation tasks. The segmentation task is used to map the input image to foreground versus background regions, whereas the detection task is used to predict the centroids of the cells. Our multitask model shares convolutional layers between the two tasks, while having task-specific output layers. Learning two tasks simultaneously reduces the risks of overfitting and also helps in separating overlapping cells better. We also introduce a similarity interface (SI) that can be integrated with our multitask network to allow easy adaptation between domains, and to compensate for the variability in contrast and texture of cells seen in microscopy images. The SI comprises an unsupervised first layer in combination with a neighborhood similarity layer (NSL). A layer of logistic sigmoid functions is used as an unsupervised first layer to separate clustered image patches from each other. The NSL transforms its input feature map at a given pixel by computing its similarity to the surrounding neighborhood. Our proposed method achieves higher/comparable detection and segmentation scores as compared to recent state-of-the-art methods with significantly reduced effort for generating training data.  2013 IEEE.","Ramesh, Nisha; Tasdizen, Tolga",10.1109/JBHI.2018.2885544,journalArticle,YWGFAM26,2019,,1
From Theory to Practice: A Data Quality Framework for Classification Tasks,YES,,,,"The data preprocessing is an essential step in knowledge discovery projects. The experts affirm that preprocessing tasks take between 50% to 70% of the total time of the knowledge discovery process. In this sense, several authors consider the data cleaning as one of the most cumbersome and critical tasks. Failure to provide high data quality in the preprocessing stage will significantly reduce the accuracy of any data analytic project. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the data quality issues in classification tasks DQF4CT. Our approach is composed of: (i) a conceptual framework to provide the user guidance on how to deal with data problems in classification tasks; and (ii) an ontology that represents the knowledge in data cleaning and suggests the proper data cleaning approaches. We presented two case studies through real datasets: physical activity monitoring (PAM) and occupancy detection of an office room (OD). With the aim of evaluating our proposal, the cleaned datasets by DQF4CT were used to train the same algorithms used in classification tasks by the authors of PAM and OD. Additionally, we evaluated DQF4CT through datasets of the Repository of Machine Learning Databases of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). In addition, 84% of the results achieved by the models of the datasets cleaned by DQF4CT are better than the models of the datasets authors.","Corrales, D.C.; Ledezma, A.; Corrales, J.C.",10.3390/sym10070248,journalArticle,BU4NP9KT,2018,,1

Corpus Augmentation for Improving Neural Machine Translation,NO,,,,"The translation quality of neural machine translation (NMT) systems depends largely on the quality of large-scale bilingual parallel corpora available. Research shows that under the condition of limited resources, the performance of NMT is greatly reduced, and a large amount of high-quality bilingual parallel data is needed to train a competitive translation model. However, not all languages have large-scale and high-quality bilingual corpus resources available. In these cases, improving the quality of the corpora has become the main focus to increase the accuracy of the NMT results. This paper proposes a new method to improve the quality of data by using data cleaning, data expansion, and other measures to expand the data at the word and sentence-level, thus improving the richness of the bilingual data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) language model is also used to ensure the smoothness of sentence construction in the process of sentence construction. At the same time, it uses a variety of processing methods to improve the quality of the bilingual data. Experiments using three standard test sets are conducted to validate the proposed method; the most advanced fairseq-transformer NMT system is used in the training. The results show that the proposed method has worked well on improving the translation results. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the BLEU value of our method is increased by 2.34 compared with that of the baseline.","Li, ZJ; Chi, CY; Zhan, YY",10.32604/cmc.2020.010265,journalArticle,6JC7PYD9,2020,,1

Clean medical data and predict heart disease,NO,,,,"The enormous data provided by the health care environment needs many important and powerful tools for analyzing and extracting data and accessing useful knowledge. Many researchers have been interested in applying many statistical tools as well as many different data mining tools in order to improve an analysis process and extract data from a different data set. The only thing that proves the success and robustness of data mining tool is accurate diagnosis of the disease. According to the (WHO), the biggest cause of death in the last ten years or so in this vast world is heart disease. The statistical exploration tools that researchers use are tools that help decision-makers in health care to predict and diagnose heart disease. The tools used in the diagnostic process for heart disease have been thoroughly tested in order to demonstrate sufficient and acceptable accuracy. A set of patient data divided into 665 records was used, of which 300 were for males, with 365 for females, with 10 different related characteristics. The decision-making department still suffers from a lack of performance and decision-making. Our paper aims to process data in different ways before the process of accessing knowledge to make the appropriate decision through expectations of classification analysis and then using techniques to extract data with acceptable accuracy. Our goal proposed in this paper is to purify the data before the disease prediction process to get the best possible prediction and compare the results with the results of a group of previous researchers to reach an accurate diagnosis and prediction. The second part of our goal is to compare between different technologies on different data sets such as decision tree technology and the second technique is Bayesian classification technology and the last technology is neural networks and the results were (98.85%, 98.16%, 91.31%), respectively.

Veridical data science,NO,,,,"Building and expanding on principles of statistics, machine learning, and scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework, composed of both a workflow and documentation, aims to provide responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent results across the data science life cycle. The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design. It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability principle. Stability expands on statistical uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. As part of the PCS workflow, we develop PCS inference procedures, namely PCS perturbation intervals and PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations. We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our own and others. Moreover, we demonstrate its favorable performance over existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in high-dimensional, sparse linear model simulations, including a wide range of misspecified models. Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook, with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.","Yu, B; Kumbier, K",10.1073/pnas.1901326117,journalArticle,CEK94Y4U,2020,,1

On robust mean estimation under coordinate-level corruption,NO,,,,"We study the problem of robust mean estimation and introduce a novel Hamming distance-based measure of distribution shift for coordinate-level corruptions. We show that this measure yields adversary models that capture more realistic corruptions than those used in prior works, and present an information-theoretic analysis of robust mean estimation in these settings. We show that for structured distributions, methods that leverage the structure yield information theoretically more accurate mean estimation. We also focus on practical algorithms for robust mean estimation and study when data cleaning-inspired approaches that first fix corruptions in the input data and then perform robust mean estimation can match the information theoretic bounds of our analysis. We finally demonstrate experimentally that this two-step approach outperforms structure-agnostic robust estimation and provides accurate mean estimation even for high-magnitude corruption.MSC Codes 68T01, 62F99 Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Study on a prediction of P2P network loan default based on the machine learning LightGBM and XGboost algorithms according to different high dimensional data cleaning,NO,,,,"Big data and the Internet financial sector tremendously developed in the 21st century. The national emphasis on this field has also gradually improved. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is an innovative mode of borrowing that is a powerful complement to the traditional financial industry. The projected default rate on credit is an absolute prerequisite for guaranteeing the proper operation of related financial projects or platforms. In this paper, we use multi-observation and multi-dimensional data cleaning method and apply the modern machine learning algorithms LightGBM in Asia at the end of 2016 and XGboost, which are based on real P2P transaction data from Lending club. The default risk of loans in the platform is strongly and innovatively predicted. And the results of different methods are compared. Furthermore, we observe that the LightGBM algorithm based on multiple observational data set classification prediction results is the best. The average performance rate of the historical transaction data of the Lending Club platform rose by 1.28 percentage points, which reduced loan defaults by approximately $117 million.

A data cleansing approach in smart home environments using artificial neural networks,NO,,,,"A smart home is generally equipped with a set of sensors/devices able to provide intelligent and personalized services to end users. These sensors/devices can sense multiple information related to the physical environment and the residents. This information is then transmitted to a central station for further processing through wireless communication. However, the wireless medium is considered vulnerable and the sensors can fail in providing correct measurements. Moreover, a smart home system should also be able to implement a cleaning system of its sensed data and discard those instances that are erroneous or incoherent. To achieve the data quality improvements, this paper proposes a new approach that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect faulty measurements. The proposed scheme can prematurely and efficiently detect outlier data before forwarding it to a central station. The performance of the solution is validated through simulations, using realistic datasets, and compared with other well-known models. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the compared models in terms of accuracy, f-score, recall and precision metrics.  2020 IEEE.","Titouna, Chafiq; Nait-Abdesselam, Farid; Darwaish, Asim",10.1109/WiMob50308.2020.9253418,conferencePaper,38VRQ8NP,2020,,1

Trusted machine learning: Model repair and data repair for probabilistic models,related,,,,"When machine learning algorithms are used in life-critical or mission-critical applications (e.g., self driving cars, cyber security, surgical robotics), it is important to ensure that they provide some high-level correctness guarantees. We introduce a paradigm called Trusted Machine Learning (TML) with the goal of making learning techniques more trustworthy. We outline methods that show how symbolic analysis (specifically parametric model checking) can be used to learn the dynamical model of a system where the learned model satisfies correctness requirements specified in the form of temporal logic properties (e.g., safety, liveness). When a learned model does not satisfy the desired guarantees, we try two approaches: (1) Model Repair, wherein we modify a learned model directly, and (2) Data Repair, wherein we modify the data so that re-learning from the modified data will result in a trusted model. Model Repair tries to make the minimal changes to the trained model while satisfying the properties, whereas Data Repair tries to make the minimal changes to the dataset used to train the model for ensuring satisfaction of the properties. We show how the Model Repair and Data Repair problems can be solved for the case of probabilistic models, specifically Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) or Markov Decision Processes (MDP), when the desired properties are expressed in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). Specifically, we outline how the parameter learning problem in the probabilistic Markov models under temporal logic constraints can be equivalently expressed as a non-linear optimization with non-linear rational constraints, by performing symbolic transformations using a parametric model checker. We illustrate the approach on two case studies: A controller for automobile lane changing, and query router for a wireless sensor network.  2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Breaking the Zuckerberg Myth: Successful Entrepreneurs Have 10 Years of Prior Employment: Utilizing Data Science and Machine Learning to Study Socio-Economic Patterns Among Successful Entrepreneurs,NO,,,,"With the advancement of Big Data technologies, and the creation of new, open source Machine Learning and Data Science tools, we now have new methods and approaches to obtain quantitative entrepreneurship research results. This approach benefits from a seemingly inexhaustible source of information, i.e. data. In this paper, we apply data science techniques from UC Berkeley's Data-X framework to research socio-economic characteristics and traits, related to successful entrepreneurs, and their link to early stage venture success. Such techniques include the use of web scraping scripts, data cleaning, the creation of data pipelines, and visualization using open source Python libraries (e.g. Scikit-learn, Pandas) as well as other tools commonly used in the Machine Learning development stack. This paper offers two types of results of the performed quantitative study, that is in the intersection between Machine Learning and Entrepreneurship Research (Fig 1.). First that the Machine Learning development stack offers powerful tools to produce entrepreneurship research results, and this might be a new paradigm in this field of research. Second, we can now quantitatively verify from public data sources that, contrary to popular belief, a successful entrepreneur is not a young, college drop-out that had a genius idea in their dorm room. Instead, the most predictive trait of entrepreneurial success is the work experience of the founder, i.e., the number of years the founder has been employed before starting their company.

Artificial neural network assisted error correction for MLC NAND flash memory,NO,,,,"The multilevel per cell technology and continued scaling down process technology significantly improves the storage density of NAND flash memory but also brings about a challenge in that data reliability degrades due to the serious noise. To ensure the data reliability, many noise mitigation technologies have been proposed. However, they only mitigate one of the noises of the NAND flash memory channel. In this paper, we consider all the main noises and present a novel neural network-assisted error correction (ANNAEC) scheme to increase the reliability of multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory. To avoid using retention time as an input parameter of the neural network, we propose a relative log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to estimate the actual LLR. Then, we trans-form the bit detection into a clustering problem and propose to employ a neural network to learn the error characteristics of the NAND flash memory channel. Therefore, the trained neural network has optimized performances of bit error detection. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of the bit error detection and increase the endurance of NAND flash memory.  2021 by the authors.

From multiple aspect trajectories to predictive analysis: a case study on fishing vessels in the Northern Adriatic sea,NO,,,,"In this paper we model spatio-temporal data describing the fishing activities in the Northern Adriatic Sea over four years. We build, implement and analyze a database based on the fusion of two complementary data sources: trajectories from fishing vessels (obtained from terrestrial Automatic Identification System, or AIS, data feed) and fish catch reports (i.e., the quantity and type of fish caught) of the main fishing market of the area. We present all the phases of the database creation, starting from the raw data and proceeding through data exploration, data cleaning, trajectory reconstruction and semantic enrichment. We implement the database by using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform. Subsequently, we perform various analyses on the resulting spatio-temporal database, with the goal of mapping the fishing activities on some key species, highlighting all the interesting information and inferring new knowledge that will be useful for fishery management. Furthermore, we investigate the use of machine learning methods for predicting the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE), an indicator of the fishing resources exploitation in order to drive specific policy design. A variety of prediction methods, taking as input the data in the database and environmental factors such as sea temperature, waves height and Clorophill-a, are put at work in order to assess their prediction ability in this field. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to integrate fishing ships trajectories derived from AIS data, environmental data and catch data for spatio-temporal prediction of CPUE - a challenging task.","Brandoli, B; Raffaeta, A; Simeoni, M; Adibi, P; Bappee, FK; Pranovi, F; Rovinelli, G; Russo, E; Silvestri, C; Soares, A; Matwin, S",10.1007/s10707-022-00463-4,journalArticle,XU6XCSS9,0,,1
Learning QoE of Mobile Video Transmission with Deep Neural Network: A Data-Driven Approach,NO,,,,"Quality of experience (QoE) serves as a direct evaluation of users' experiences in mobile video transmission and thus essential for network management, such as network optimization. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based QoE prediction approach with a large-scale QoE dataset for mobile video transmission. Specifically, we develop a mobile phone application for collecting user QoE data when viewing videos transmitted over the mobile internet in a practical environment. Then, we construct a large-scale dataset by collecting over 80000 piece of data with four kinds of subjective scores and 89 network parameters. Each QoE metric is related to only some of the 89 network parameters. Therefore, we apply the feature selection method to find the feature parameters related to user scores. Additionally, the boxplot method is used to clean the raw data by removing outliers. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to learn the relationships between the network parameters and the subjective QoE scores. The proposed DNN can also be seen as a data-driven objective QoE prediction approach for mobile video transmission, which can be used to predict the user QoE scores. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively remove most features irrelevant to QoE prediction. Moreover, the performance of QoE prediction by the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.  1983-2012 IEEE.","Tao, Xiaoming; Duan, Yiping; Xu, Mai; Meng, Zhishen; Lu, Jianhua",10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904359,journalArticle,WZ6K9P6F,2019,,1

Correlation based neuro-fuzzy Wiener type wind power forecasting model by using special separate signals,NO,,,,"The wind power system is characterized by complex structures, numerous effect elements, and complicated physical relationships, which bring great difficulties to establish the wind power forecasting model and result in the unsatisfactory prediction accuracy of wind power. In this paper, a correlation based neuro-fuzzy Wiener type wind power forecasting model is proposed by using special separate signals to decouple dynamic linear and static nonlinear characteristics of wind power systems for high-accuracy wind power forecasting. This method introduces an autoregressive exogenous model and fuzzy neural network to explore the underlying distribution characteristics of wind power systems by correlation analysis of the linear and nonlinear information contained in time-series data of the wind power system. In addition, in order to eliminate outliers in the original data set, an abnormal data cleaning approach combining quartile and two-stage clustering algorithm is employed to reduce the computation time and improve the model accuracy. Moreover, the convergence of the Wiener model is proved by the Lyapunov function.

Power grid cloud resource status data compression method based on deep-learning,NO,,,,"Background: As the ""three-type two-net, world-class"" strategy is proposed, the key issues to be addressed are that the number of cloud resources in power grid continues to grow and there is a large amount of data to be filed every day. The long-term preservation of data, using backup data for the operation and maintenance, fault recovery, fault drill and tracking of cloud platform are essential. The traditional compression algorithm faces severe challenges. Methods: In this case, this paper proposes the deep-learning method for data compression. First, a more accurate and complete grid cloud resource status data is gathered through data cleaning, correction, and standardization, the preprocessed data is then compressed by SaDE-MSAE. Results: Experiments show that the SaDE-MSAE method can compress data faster. The data compression ratio based on neural network is basically between 45% and 60%, which is relatively stable and stronger than the traditional compression algorithm. Conclusion: The paper can compress the data quickly and efficiently in a large amount of power data. Improve the speed and accuracy of the algorithm while ensuring that the data is correct and complete, and improve the compression time and efficiency through the neural network. It gives better compression schemes and cloud resource data grid.  2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Liang, Weixuan; Zhu, Youchan; Li, Guoliang",10.2174/2213275912666190710155318,journalArticle,IRYZHJ8E,2021,,1

Utilizing Link Prediction Approach to Predict Express-Related Counterfeit Cigarette Crime Cases,NO,,,,"In this paper, an approach for express-related counterfeit cigarette criminality analysis based on link prediction approach and historical express big data is proposed. In the pre-processing stage, data integration, data cleaning and data structured processing methods are utilized to process the original express data. Then time series and graph topological features of express data are computed. The former can be computed based on package delivery and receiving frequency during a period of time, which can be regarded as time series data, by using time domain statistics. The latter can be calculated on a directed graph built with historical express big data. Next, based on this feature pool, the classifier model was trained and optimized to predict the probability of a package containing counterfeit cigarettes.

A short study on compressing decoder-based language models,NO,,,,"Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been successful for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The state-of-the-art of PLMs, however, are extremely large to be used on edge devices. As a result, the topic of model compression has attracted increasing attention in the NLP community. Most of the existing works focus on compressing encoder-based models (tiny-BERT, distilBERT, distilRoBERTa, etc), however, to the best of our knowledge, the compression of decoder-based models (such as GPT-2) has not been investigated much. Our paper aims to fill this gap. Specifically, we explore two directions: 1) we employ current state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques to improve fine-tuning of DistilGPT-2. 2) we pre-train a compressed GPT-2 model using layer truncation and compare it against the distillation-based method (DistilGPT2). The training time of our compressed model is significantly less than DistilGPT-2, but it can achieve better performance when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. We also demonstrate the impact of data cleaning on model performance. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Designing an Intelligent Virtual Educational System to Improve the Efficiency of Primary Education in Developing Countries,NO,,,,"Incorporating technology into virtual education encourages educational institutions to demand a migration from the current learning management system towards an intelligent virtual educational system, seeking greater benefit by exploiting the data generated by students in their day-to-day activities. Therefore, the design of these intelligent systems must be performed from a new perspective, which will take advantage of the new analytical functions provided by technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, educational data mining techniques, and web analytics. This paper focuses on primary education in developing countries, showing the design of an intelligent virtual educational system to improve the efficiency of primary education through recommendations based on reliable data. The intelligent system is formed of four subsystems: data warehousing, analytical data processing, monitoring process and recommender system for educational agents. To illustrate this, the paper contains two dashboards that analyze, respectively, the digital resources usage time and an aggregate profile of teachers' digital skills, in order to infer new activities that improve efficiency. These intelligent virtual educational systems focus the teaching-learning process on new forms of interaction on an educational future oriented to personalized teaching for the students, and new evaluation and teaching processes for each professor.","Alonso-Secades, V; Lopez-Rivero, AJ; Martin-Merino-Acera, M; Ruiz-Garcia, MJ; Arranz-Garcia, O",10.3390/electronics11091487,journalArticle,MTGXQ9PY,2022,,1

Predicting Ship Maintenance and Repair Labor with Artificial Neural Networks,NO,,,,"Ship maintenance and repair work cost estimation is often regarded as an ""Art,"" which may contribute to the financial success or distress of a shipyard. Regarded as experts by senior management, estimators are among the most valued resources, and nonetheless, human. Over time, estimators learn from mistakes, and get better with tenure at sharpening assessments. When estimators retire without having groomed an apprentice, shipyards may be at risk of losing a lot of know-how, all at once. These shipyards may well find very costly to experience, for a while, estimating skills stepping back on the learning curve. Yet, even shipyards relying on less advanced information technology may have unwittingly accumulated a lot of valuable data relevant to ship maintenance and repair works. These shipyards may overlook how easily accessible knowledge can be turned into a competitive advantage through predictive analytics. Not only can this data be literally mined, but machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), can now process it for a speedy and preliminary estimate through faster and cheaper computing power. To be clear, the purpose is not to replace the human estimator but to help the expert quickly assess, when times are busy, whether to bid or not on a specific project opportunity. In the absence of The Master Estimator, an Apprentice may also look for a quick and cheap sanity check of the prepared estimate before submitting a bid. The study carried out in this article is based on all ship maintenance and repair data recorded at a single North American shipyard over the last 19 years since the current information systems were implemented. This raw data extract with all directly paid hours logged daily by workers on 1277 ship maintenance and repair projects was screened through advanced data cleansing. To enrich the cleansed data tables, additional independent variables were subsequently collected internally and externally to develop a trainingtesting data set. The final 657 projects represent 136 vessels regrouped in eight types, for which 28 other independent variables were all made available for training up to testing simple ANN models. The scope of this article is limited to the estimation of the direct labor required to complete ship maintenance and repair projects on a specific type of vessels for which workforce planning and tactical pricing was deemed the most relevant to keep the business afloat.  2022 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

Data conditioning and forecasting methodology using machine learning onproduction data for a well pad,NO,,,,"A new machine learning (ML)/statistical-based methodology for conditioning and predicting productiondata for a well pad has been developed. Typically, data conditioning involves outlier detection, missingdata, data imputation, and smoothing. Time-series production data prediction can be challenging becausethe target (wellbore oil production) depends on large-scale, high-dimensional data sets with unknowndistributions and is influenced by missing data and outliers. Hence, data conditioning is key for accuratepredictions. The current work is the first attempt at using ensemble ML and statistical techniques, such asmultilayer perceptron (MLP), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector regression (SVR),for well pad data conditioning using recently disclosed subsurface and production data from a field inthe southern area of the Norwegian North Sea. The time-series forecasting based on large-scale, high-dimensional conditioned and cleaned data sets is also presented. The data with an oil production rate greater than 10 Sm3 have been retained for data cleansing, whichreduced the size of the production well data set by 14.9%. Outliers are detected using the z-score method.The missing values are predicted using a trained ML model on all available nonmissing data. The procedurefirst predicts the downhole missing values from all the wells, including the available neighboring wells, andthen uses these features to predict other missing values for the well pad. In this paper, the two approachesimplemented and compared for prediction of missing data are MLP and SVR, and PCA is performed toextract the most important data features. Production data with 12 related variables (i.e., dates, hours, temperature, pressure, etc.) are used to explorethe complex nonlinearity of features and estimate wellbore oil production with ML and deep-learningmodels. Conventional SVR and MLP methods are implemented as the benchmark. During this work, more than 60% of the missing and abnormal data from the field data set are detectedand imputed using advanced ML methods, such as MLP and SVR with radial basis function kernel. Morethan 6% of data are outliers and are removed using the z-score method. The modified SVR with time-seriesdata structure and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms are used for the comparisons. An R-squared(R2) of 98% is achieved for both the algorithms; however, LSTM has the lowest root mean square error(RMSE) results compared to SVR. Data conditioning is conventionally performed using statistical techniques, but here, an ensemble of MLtechniques is used depending on the available data. This paper presents a new methodology to performdata conditioning and production prediction for a well pad using ML and neighboring well data. The MLalgorithms used are highly efficient, as demonstrated by the results.  2020, Offshore Technology Conference.","Bagheri, Maryam; Zhao, Haoran; Sun, Manyang; Huang, Li; Madasu, Srinath; Lindner, Peggy; Toti, Giulia",,conferencePaper,AVFFCFIN,2020,,1
Intelligent data collaboration in heterogeneous-device IoT platforms,NO,,,,"The merging boundaries between edge computing and deep learning are forging a new blueprint for the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the low-quality of data in many IoT platforms, especially those composed of heterogeneous devices, is hindering the development of high-quality applications for those platforms. The solution presented in this article is intelligent data collaboration, i.e., the concept of deep learning providing IoT with the ability to adaptively collaborate to accomplish a task. Here, we outline the concept of intelligent data collaboration in detail and present a mathematical model in general form. To demonstrate one possible case where intelligent data collaboration would be useful, we prepared an implementation called adaptive data cleaning (ADC), designed to filter noisy data out of temperature readings in an IoT base station network. ADC primarily consists of a denoising autoencoder LSTM for predictions and a four-level data processing mechanism to perform the filtering. Comparisons between ADC and a maximum slop method show ADC with the lowest false error and the best filtering rates.  2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Sun, Danfeng; Wu, Jia; Yang, Jian; Wu, Huifeng",10.1145/3427912,journalArticle,LJ8JK8J6,2021,,1

Plant Leaf Disease Recognition Using Fastai Image Classification,NO,,,,"Agricultural productivity has a vital role in the Indian economy, but it is seriously hampered by pests and plant diseases. Neural networks have been a major step forward in solving this problem in the past two decades. However, the existing systems in place are computation-heavy and costly to implement. Such tasks also ideally require a dataset of leaf images that simulates real environment conditions, which is hard to find. The motivation of this paper therefore is to solve all these issues by building a light-weight and cost efficient deep learning architecture with the proposed DenseNet-121 model that classifies leaf images from a dataset called 'PlantDoc' across 28 classes with 1874 training images and 468 validation images. A separate test dataset is held out only for checking model performance on unknown data. Implementation is done using Fastai framework, because of its faster computational power, easy workflow and unique data cleaning functionalities.

"An Iterative, Self-Assessing Entity Resolution System: First Steps toward a Data Washing Machine",traditional DC,,,,"Data curation is the process of acquiring multiple sources of data, assessing and improving data quality, standardizing, and integrating the data into a usable information product, and eventually disposing of the data. The research describes the building of a proof-of-concept for an unsupervised data curation process addressing a basic form of data cleansing in the form of identifying redundant records through entity resolution and spelling corrections. The novelty of the approach is to use ER as the first step using an unsupervised blocking and stop word scheme based on token frequency. A scoring matrix is used for linking unstandardized references, and an unsupervised process for evaluating linking results based on cluster entropy. The ER process is iterative, and in each iteration, the match threshold is increased. The prototype was tested on 18 fully-annotated test samples of primarily synthetic person data varied in two different ways, good data quality versus poor data quality, and a single record layout versus two different record layouts. In samples with good data quality and using both single and mixed layouts, the final clusters had an average F-measure of 0.91, precision of 0.96, and recall of 0.87 outcomes comparable to results from a supervised ER process. In samples with poor data quality whether mixed or single layout, the average F-measure was 0.78, precision 0.74, and recall 0.83 showing that data quality assessment and improvement is still a critical component of successful data curation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of building an unsupervised ER engine to support data integration for good quality references while avoiding the time and effort to standardize reference sources to a common layout, design, and test matching rules, design blocking keys, or test blocking alignment. Also, the paper proposes how unsupervised data quality improvement processes could also be incorporated into the design allowing the model to address an even broader range of data curation applications.  2020 Science and Information Organization.

Fraud Detection by Machine Learning,NO,,,,"Fraud detection is to find unusual events during screen credit card transactions, insurance claims, account applications, etc. In this paper, five supervised models were built to identify which transactions are fraud. This work gathered the real transaction data from web site. The process of this work included data description, data cleaning, variable creation, feature selection (using filter and wrapper) and modelling. In the process of variable creation, this work created about 220 variables. After feature selection, this work finally selected 40 variables. During modelling process, five machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, neural network and boosted tree, were built. The best model turns out to be Boosted Tree, with a 54.3% FDR at 3% cutoff for testing and a 54% FDR at 3% cutoff for OOT. The research significance of this work lies in how to deal with possible risks in credit card transactions in real time.

Machine Learning Techniques for Stress Prediction in Working Employees,NO,,,,"Stress disorders are a common issue among working IT professionals in the industry today. With changing lifestyle and work cultures, there is an increase in the risk of stress among the employees. Though many industries and corporates provide mental health related schemes and try to ease the workplace atmosphere, the issue is far from control. In this paper, we would like to apply machine learning techniques to analyze stress patterns in working adults and to narrow down the factors that strongly determine the stress levels. Towards this, data from the OSMI mental health survey 2017 responses of working professionals within the tech-industry was considered. Various Machine Learning techniques were applied to train our model after due data cleaning and preprocessing. The accuracy of the above models was obtained and studied comparatively. Boosting had the highest accuracy among the models implemented. By using Decision Trees, prominent features that influence stress were identified as gender, family history and availability of health benefits in the workplace. With these results, industries can now narrow down their approach to reduce stress and create a much comfortable workplace for their employees.  2018 IEEE.","Reddy, U Srinivasulu; Thota, Aditya Vivek; Dharun, A.",10.1109/ICCIC.2018.8782395,conferencePaper,D7AYUGQB,2018,,1
Research on estimated time of arrival prediction based upon ADS-B and spatiotemporal analysis,NO,,,,"Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) is of great importance for airport department of operation and ground service. Precise ETA prediction is the core element of Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) system, which is intended to improve the real-time airport gate assignment, reduce runway intrusion risk and cut down waiting time for ground maintenance vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model to address ETA prediction problem by application of supervised learning methods based on multisource data. The proposed model consists of two parts: spatiotemporal trajectories storage and clustering-based prediction. Firstly, in the preprocessing part, after data cleaning, filtering, re-sampling and data storage, we increase the dimension of trajectory variable. Then, the discrete track points are clustered into several patterns by clustering algorithm. Using real-time data cross validation, the model is trained to find out the different prediction factor of ETA for each individual cluster cell under various conditions. Finally, the predicted ETA for each flight is generated. Lots of validation work has been approached with this model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method based on spatiotemporal data analysis is the most effective and accurate. The system that implements this model has been developed and deployed into the production runtime environment in Xian Airport, Harbin Airport, Nanjing Airport, Shenzhen Airport, etc.",Yang Jie; Chen Hui; Liu Xingyu; Wang Xuhui,10.1109/ICCASIT48058.2019.8973117,conferencePaper,QP9JKKFV,2019,,1
Computer Architectures for Incremental Learning in Water Management,NO,,,,"This paper presents an architecture and a platform for processing of water management data in real time. Stakeholders in the domain are faced with the challenge of handling large amounts of incoming sensor data from heterogeneous sources after the digitalization efforts within the sector. Our water management analytical platform (WMAP) is built upon the needs of domain experts (it provides capabilities for offline analysis) and is designed to solve real-world problems (it provides real-time data flow solutions and data-driven predictive analytics) for smart water management. WMAP is expected to contribute significantly to the water management domain, which has not yet acquired the competences to implement extensive data analysis and modeling capabilities in real-world scenarios. The proposed architecture extends existing big data architectures and presents an efficient way of dealing with data-driven modeling in the water management domain. The main improvement is in the speed (online analytics) layer of the architecture, where we introduce heterogeneous data fusion in a set of data streams that provide real-time data-driven modeling and prediction services. Using the proposed architecture, the results illustrate that models built with datasets with richer contextual information and multiple data sources are more accurate and thus more useful.","Kenda, K; Mellios, N; Senozetnik, M; Pergar, P",10.3390/su14052886,journalArticle,DC9D9P9U,2022,,1
Improving Association Rules Accuracy in Noisy Domains Using Instance Reduction Techniques,NO,,,,"Association rules learning is a machine learning method used in finding underlying associations in large datasets. Whether intentionally or unintentionally present, noise in training instances causes overfitting while building the classifier and negatively impacts classification accuracy. This paper uses instance reduction techniques for the datasets before mining the association rules and building the classifier. Instance reduction techniques were originally developed to reduce memory requirements in instance-based learning. This paper utilizes them to remove noise from the dataset before training the association rules classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted to assess the accuracy of association rules with different instance reduction techniques, namely:DecrementalReduction Optimization Procedure (DROP) 3, DROP5, ALL K-Nearest Neighbors (ALLKNN), Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN), and Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbor (RENN) in different noise ratios. Experiments show that instance reduction techniques substantially improved the average classification accuracy on three different noise levels: 0%, 5%, and 10%. The RENN algorithm achieved the highest levels of accuracy with a significant improvement on seven out of eight used datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The improvements were more apparent in the 5% and the 10% noise cases. When RENN was applied, the average classification accuracy for the eight datasets in the zero-noise test enhanced from 70.47% to 76.65% compared to the original test. The average accuracy was improved from 66.08% to 77.47% for the 5%-noise case and from 59.89% to 77.59% in the 10%-noise case. Higher confidence was also reported in building the association rules when RENN was used. The above results indicate that RENN is a good solution in removing noise and avoiding overfitting during the construction of the association rules classifier, especially in noisy domains.  2022 Tech Science Press.

Data mining and knowledge discovery in chemical processes: Effect of alternative processing techniques,NO,,,,"Data mining and knowledge discovery (DMKD) focuses on extracting useful information from data. In the chemical process industry, tasks such as process monitoring, fault detection, process control, optimization, etc., can be achieved using DMKD. However, the selection of the appropriate method for each step in the DMKD process, namely data cleaning, sampling, scaling, dimensionality reduction (DR), clustering, clustering analysis and data visualization to obtain meaningful insights is far from trivial. In this contribution, a computational environment (FastMan) is introduced and used to illustrate how method selection affects DMKD in chemical process data. Two case studies, using data from a simulated natural gas liquid plant and real data from an industrial pyrolysis unit, were conducted to demonstrate the applicability of these methodologies in real-life scenarios. Sampling and normalization methods were found to have a great impact on the quality of the DMKD results. Also, a neighbor graphs method for DR, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, outperformed principal component analysis, a matrix factorization method frequently used in the chemical process industry for identifying both local and global changes.

Deep Learning and Image Processing Techniques for Recognizing Liquid-Crystal Display Array Residue and the Automatic Planning of Laser-Cutting Segments,NO,,,,"Defect detection in thin-film transistor liquid-crystal displays (TFT-LCDs) is crucial for ensuring the quality of the display. However, because of the diversity of TFT-LCD panel defects, accurate localization and detection become difficult. To overcome these problems, this study used deep learning and image processing algorithms that automatically detect TFT array defects and presented a laser-cutting path that removes only array defect regions. First, the YOLOv4 model was used to locate the defect and glass region of interest (ROI) in panel images, and a semantic segmentation model (FCN-VGG16) was used to identify defect and glass pixel positions in the ROI. Finally, the effective cutting range of faults was determined using overlap and nonoverlap cutting (ON-cutting) judgment methods. In this investigation, three types of defects were used: D1, D2, and D3. According to the proposed ON-cutting methodology, the error repair rates (ERRs) of D1-, D2-, and D3-type defects were 4.79&#x0025;, 0&#x0025;, and 0&#x0025;, respectively. Therefore, these strategies can help manufacturers enhance the quality of TFT-LCD panels by identifying and locating the optimal glass cutting line and defective pixels.",Y. -P. Huang; T. -H.

"Finding a trend out of chaos, a machine learning approach for well spacing optimization",NO,,,,"Data-driven decisions powered by machine-learning methods are increasing in popularity when it comes to optimizing field development in unconventional reservoirs. However, since well performance is impacted by many factors (e.g., geological characteristics, completion design, well design, etc.), the challenge is uncovering trends from all the noise. By leveraging basin-level knowledge captured by big data sculpting, integrating private and public data with the use of uncertainty quantification, Augmented AI (a combination of expert-based knowledge and advanced AI frameworks) can provide quick and science-based answers for well spacing and fracking optimization and assess the full potential of an asset in unconventional reservoirs. Augmented AI is artificial intelligence powered by engineering wisdom. The Augmented AI workflow starts with data sculpting, which includes information retrieval, data cleaning and standardization, and finally a smart, deep and systematic data QC. Feature engineering generates all the relevant parameters going into the machine learning model-over 50 features have been generated for this work and categorized. The final step is to perform model tuning and ensemble, evaluating the model robustness, generating model explanation and uncertainty quantification. Augmented AI adopts an iterative machine learning modeling approach. This approach combines new and innovative engineering and G&G workflows with data-driven models so that a deep understanding of the field behavior can be developed. Loops from feature selection to model tuning are used until good model results are achieved. The loop is automated using Bayesians optimization. All machine learning models have different strengths and weaknesses for prediction. Instead of manually determining which machine learning model to use, this approach uses an adaptive ensemble machine learning approach that is a stacking algorithm that combines multiple regression models via a second level machine learning model. It smartly aggregates opinions from different models with reduced variance and better robustness. Augmented AI has been applied in unconventional reservoirs with great results. A case study in Midland Basin is presented in this paper. Domain-induced feature engineering was performed to obtain important features for predicting well performance, and initial feature selection was conducted using feature correlation analysis. A trusted and explainable ML model was built and enhanced with uncertainty quantification. After running several sensitivity analyses, Augmented AI optimized the attributes of interest, then vetted the outcome, generating a report and visualizing the results. In addition, further information about the direct impact of well spacing on EUR was deconvoluted from other parameters using an ML explanation technique for Wolfcamp Formation in Permian Basin and subsequently well spacing optimization was presented for the case study in Midland Basin. An innovative model was created using Augmented AI to optimize well spacing, leveraging big data sculpting, domain and physics-induced feature engineering, and machine learning. The learning was transferred from the basin model to the specific region of interest. Augmented AI provides efficient and systematic private data organization, an explainable machine learning model, robust production forecast with quantified uncertainty and well spacing and frac parameters optimization. Augmented AI models are already built for major basins such as Midland and Delaware basins. The learning and knowledge of the model can be transferred to any region in a basin and can be refined using more accurate private data. This allows conclusions to be drawn even with a limited number of wells.

We introduce Sherlock, a multi-input deep neural network for detecting semantic types. We train Sherlock on 686,765 data columns retrieved from the VizNet corpus by matching 78 semantic types from DBpedia to column headers. We characterize each matched column with 1, 588 features describing the statistical properties, character distributions, word embeddings, and paragraph vectors of column values. Sherlock achieves a support-weighted F1 score of 0.89, exceeding that of machine learning baselines, dictionary and regular expression benchmarks, and the consensus of crowdsourced annotations.","Hulsebos, M.; Hu, K.; Bakker, M.; Zgraggen, E.; Satyanarayan, A.; Kraska, T.; Demiralp, C.; Hidalgo, C.",,journalArticle,TH7AWZ4Y,2019,,1
"Automated, strain-based, output-only bridge damage detection",NO,,,,"This paper presents a framework for automated damage detection using a continuous stream of structural health monitoring data. The study utilized measured strains from an optimized sensor set deployed on a double track, steel, railway, truss bridge. Stringer-floor beam connection deterioration, a common deficiency, was the focus of this study; however, the proposed methodology could be used to assess the condition of a wide range of structural elements and details. The framework utilized Proper Orthogonal Modes (POMs) as damage features and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as an automated approach to infer damage location and intensity from the POMs. POM variations, which are traditionally input (load) dependent, were ultimately utilized as damage indicators. Input variability necessitated implementing ANNs to help decouple POM changes due to load variations from those caused by deficiencies, changes that would render the proposed framework input independent, a significant advancement. To develop an automated and efficient output-only damage detection framework, data cleansing and preparation were conducted prior to ANN training. Damage ""scenarios"" were artificially introduced into select output (strain) datasets recorded while monitoring train passes across the selected bridge. This information, in turn, was used to train ANNs using MATLABs Neural Net Toolbox. Trained ANNs were tested against monitored loading events and artificial damage scenarios. Applicability of the proposed, output-only framework was investigated via studies of the bridge under operational conditions. To account for the effects of potential deficiencies at the stringer-floor beam connections, measured signal amplitudes were artificially decreased at select locations. It was concluded that the proposed framework could successfully detect artificial deficiencies imposed on measured signals under operational conditions.","Rageh, A; Linzell, D; Azam, SE",10.1007/s13349-018-0311-6,journalArticle,VNW5ISEK,2018,,1

An efficient IoT based prediction system for classification of water using novel adaptive incremental learning framework,NO,,,,"Creating an adaptive, accurate, and reliable model is a universal problem.

Initially, water quality data is collected using IoT sensors. After that, data cleaning is performed by removing missing values and outliers. Next, features associated with the sensed data are obtained, and unwanted features are removed. Then, the G-SMOTE technique is proposed, which hybridizes the SMOTE and the genetic algorithm to address the imbalanced data set problem.

Recursive Monte Carlo and Variational Inference with Auxiliary Variables,NO,,,,"A key challenge in applying Monte Carlo and variational inference (VI) is the design of proposals and variational families that are flexible enough to closely approximate the posterior, but simple enough to admit tractable densities and variational bounds. This paper presents recursive auxiliary-variable inference (RAVI), a new framework for exploiting flexible proposals, for example based on involved simulations or stochastic optimization, within Monte Carlo and VI algorithms. The key idea is to estimate intractable proposal densities via meta-inference: additional Monte Carlo or variational inference targeting the proposal, rather than the model. RAVI generalizes and unifies several existing methods for inference with expressive approximating families, which we show correspond to specific choices of meta-inference algorithm, and provides new theory for analyzing their bias and variance.

Data-driven insights from predictive analytics on heterogeneous experimental data of industrial magnetic materials,NO,,,,"Data-driven methods are becoming increasingly popular in the field of materials science. While most data-driven models are trained on simulation data as it is relatively easier to collect a large amount of data from physics-based simulations, there are many challenges in applying data-driven methods on experiments: 1) experimental data is usually not clean; and 2) it generally has a greater degree of heterogeneity. In this project, we have developed a data-driven methodology to address these challenges on an industrial magnet dataset, where the goal is to predict magnetic properties (forward models) at different stages of the experimental workflow. The data-driven methodology consists of data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model development using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to accurately predict magnet properties. In particular, we have developed three different types of predictive models: 1) numerical model using only numerical data containing composition and processing information; 2) image model using image data representing structure information; and 3) combination model using both types of data together. In addition to predictive models, the analysis and comparison of results across the models provide several interesting data-driven insights. Such data-driven analytics has the potential to help guide future experiments and realize the inverse models, which could significantly reduce costs and accelerate the discovery of new magnets with superior properties. The proposed models are already deployed in Toyota Motor Corporation.  2019 IEEE.","Yang, Zijiang; Watari, Tetsushi; Ichigozaki, Daisuke; Morohoshi, Kei; Suga, Yoshinori; Liao, Wei-Keng; Choudhary, Alok; Agrawal, Ankit",10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00119,conferencePaper,SYKM8A85,2019,,1
"Electricity Consumption Prediction using Energy Data, Socio-economic and Weather Indicators. A Case Study of Spain",NO,,,,"Electricity consumption analysis and forecasting is a vital topic of research in the energy sector due to its important role in the reduction of energy waste and improvement of energy-related environmental issues. Spain is one of the largest energy consumers in Europe which consumption rates at the country level are not profoundly examined. This study presents a multivariate modeling methodology for Spain's electricity consumption prediction based on 14 socio-economic, 3 energy-related, and 2 meteorological variables using machine learning and statistical analysis tools. Historical data covering the period from January 2008 to December 2019 with monthly periodicity is used. The obtained experimental results show that the electricity consumption forecasting model combining a random forest-based feature selection method, a wavelet transform-based denoising scheme and a statistical forecasting tool called SARIMAX produces lower error rates (RMSE=0.125 and MAPE=2.85%) compared to other existing state-of-the-art techniques used for the same dataset.  2021 IEEE.","Grigoryan, Hakob",10.1109/ICCMA54375.2021.9646220,conferencePaper,QZGTED6M,2021,,1

An intermediate representation for optimizing machine learning pipelines,related,,,,"Machine learning (ML) pipelines for model training and validation typically include preprocessing, such as data cleaning and feature engineering, prior to training an ML model. Preprocessing combines relational algebra and user-defined functions (UDFs), while model training uses iterations and linear algebra. Current systems are tailored to either of the two. As a consequence, preprocessing and ML steps are optimized in isolation. To enable holistic optimization of ML training pipelines, we present Lara, a declarative domainspecific language for collections and matrices. Lara's intermediate representation (IR) re ects on the complete program, i.e., UDFs, control ow, and both data types. Two views on the IR enable diverse optimizations. Monads enable operator pushdown and fusion across type and loop boundaries. Combinators provide the semantics of domainspecific operators and optimize data access and cross-validation of ML algorithms. Our experiments on preprocessing pipelines and selected ML algorithms show the effects of our proposed optimizations on dense and sparse data, which achieve speedups of up to an order of magnitude.  2019, is held by the owner/author(s).","Kunft, Andreas; Katsifodimos, Asterios; Schelter, Sebastian; Brec, Sebastian; Rabl, Tilmann; Markl, Volker",10.14778/3342263.3342633,journalArticle,F86VP2SI,2018,,1

Confident learning: Estimating uncertainty in dataset labels,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",?,label,"Learning exists in the context of data, yet notions of confidence typically focus on model predictions, not label quality. Confident learning (CL) is an alternative approach which focuses instead on label quality by characterizing and identifying label errors in datasets, based on the principles of pruning noisy data, counting with probabilistic thresholds to estimate noise, and ranking examples to train with confidence. Whereas numerous studies have developed these principles independently, here, we combine them, building on the assumption of a class-conditional noise process to directly estimate the joint distribution between noisy (given) labels and uncorrupted (unknown) labels. This results in a generalized CL which is provably consistent and experimentally performant. We present sufficient conditions where CL exactly finds label errors, and show CL performance exceeding seven recent competitive approaches for learning with noisy labels on the CIFAR dataset. Uniquely, the CL framework is not coupled to a specific data modality or model (e.g., we use CL to find several label errors in the presumed error-free MNIST dataset and improve sentiment classification on text data in Amazon Reviews). We also employ CL on ImageNet to quantify ontological class overlap (e.g., estimating 645 missile images are mislabeled as their parent class projectile), and moderately increase model accuracy (e.g., for ResNet) by cleaning data prior to training. These results are replicable using the open-source cleanlab release. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

LODsyndesis: Global Scale Knowledge Services,NO,,,,"In this paper, we present LODsyndesis, a suite of services over the datasets of the entire Linked Open Data Cloud, which offers fast, content-based dataset discovery and object co-reference. Emphasis is given on supporting scalable cross-dataset reasoning for finding all information about any entity and its provenance. Other tasks that can be benefited from these services are those related to the quality and veracity of data since the collection of all information about an entity, and the cross-dataset inference that is feasible, allows spotting the contradictions that exist, and also provides information for data cleaning or for estimating and suggesting which data are probably correct or more accurate. In addition, we will show how these services can assist the enrichment of existing datasets with more features for obtaining better predictions in machine learning tasks. Finally, we report measurements that reveal the sparsity of the current datasets, as regards their connectivity, which in turn justifies the need for advancing the current methods for data integration. Measurements focusing on the cultural domain are also included, specifically measurements over datasets using CIDOC CRM (Conceptual Reference Model), and connectivity measurements of British Museum data.

Predicting mechanical properties of high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites by integrating micromechanics and machine learning,NO,,,,"Current development of high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (HPFRCC) mainly relies on intensive experiments. The main purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning method for effective and efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC. Specifically, this research develops machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of HPFRCC through innovative incorporation of micromechanics, aiming to increase the prediction accuracy and generalization performance by enriching and improving the datasets through data cleaning, principal component analysis (PCA), and K-fold cross-validation. This study considers a total of 14 different mix design variables and predicts the ductility of HPFRCC for the first time, in addition to the compressive and tensile strengths. Different types of machine learning methods are investigated and compared, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression tree (CART), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The results show that the developed machine learning models can reasonably predict the concerned mechanical properties and can be applied to perform parametric studies for the effects of different mix design variables on the mechanical properties. This study is expected to greatly promote efficient discovery and development of HPFRCC.  2021 by the authors.

Prediction and Staging of Hepatic Fibrosis in Children with Hepatitis C Virus: A Machine Learning Approach,NO,,,,"Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop an intelligent diagnostic system utilizing machine learning for data cleansing, then build an intelligent model and obtain new cutoff values for APRI (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio) and FIB-4 (fibrosis score) for the prediction and staging of fibrosis in children with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: Random forest (RF) was utilized in this study for data cleansing; then, prediction and staging of fibrosis, APRI and FIB-4 scores and their areas under the ROC curve (AUC) have been obtained on the cleaned dataset. A cohort of 166 Egyptian children with CHC was studied. Results: RF, APRI, and FIB-4 achieved high AUCs; where APRI had AUCs of 0.78, 0.816, and 0.77; FIB-4 had AUCs of 0.74, 0.828, and 0.78; and RF had AUCs of 0.903, 0.894, and 0.822, for the prediction of any type of fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and differentiating between mild and advanced fibrosis, respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning is a valuable addition to non-invasive methods of liver fibrosis prediction and staging in pediatrics. Furthermore, the obtained cutoff values for APRI and FIB-4 showed good performance and are consistent with some previously obtained cutoff values. There was some agreement between the predictions of RF, APRI and FIB-4 for the prediction and staging of fibrosis.","Barakat, NH; Barakat, SH; Ahmed, N",10.4258/hir.2019.25.3.173,journalArticle,RDRSSQTR,2019,,1

Evaluation of text-to-gesture generation model using convolutional neural network,NO,,,,"Conversational gestures have a crucial role in realizing natural interactions with virtual agents and robots. Data-driven approaches, such as deep learning and machine learning, are promising in constructing the gesture generation model, which automatically provides the gesture motion for speech or spoken texts. This study experimentally analyzes a deep learning-based gesture generation model from spoken text using a convolutional neural network. The proposed model takes a sequence of spoken words as the input and outputs a sequence of 2D joint coordinates representing the conversational gesture motion. We prepare a dataset consisting of gesture motions and spoken texts by adding text information to an existing dataset and train the models using specific speaker's data. The quality of the generated gestures is compared with those from an existing speech-to-gesture generation model through a user perceptual study. The subjective evaluation shows that the model performance is comparable or superior to those by the existing speech-to-gesture generation model. In addition, we investigate the importance of data cleansing and loss function selection in the text-to-gesture generation model. We further examine the model transferability between speakers. The experimental results demonstrate successful model transferability of the proposed model.

TabReformer: Unsupervised Representation Learning for Erroneous Data Detection,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Error detection is a crucial preliminary phase in any data analytics pipeline. Existing error detection techniques typically target specific types of errors. Moreover, most of these detection models either require user-defined rules or ample hand-labeled training examples. Therefore, in this article, we present TabReformer, a model that learns bidirectional encoder representations for tabular data. The proposed model consists of two main phases. In the first phase, TabReformer follows encoder architecture with multiple self-attention layers to model the dependencies between cells and capture tuple-level representations. Also, the model utilizes a Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function with the Masked Data Model objective to achieve deeper probabilistic understanding. In the second phase, the model parameters are fine-tuned for the task of erroneous data detection. The model applies a data augmentation module to generate more erroneous examples to represent the minority class. The experimental evaluation considers a wide range of databases with different types of errors and distributions. The empirical results show that our solution can enhance the recall values by 32.95% on average compared with state-of-the-art techniques while reducing the manual effort by up to 48.86%.  2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Impact of Data Quality and Target Representation on Predictions for Urban Bus Networks,NO,,,,"Passengers of urban bus networks often rely on forecasts of Estimated Times of Arrival (ETA) and live-vehicle movements to plan their journeys. ETA predictions are unreliable due to the lack of good quality historical data, while 'live' positions in mobile apps suffer from delays in data transmission. This study uses deep neural networks to predict the next position of a bus under various vehicle-location data-quality regimes. Additionally, we assess the effect of the target representation in the prediction problem by encoding it either as unconstrained geographical coordinates, progress along known trajectory or ETA at the next two stops. We demonstrate that without data cleaning, model predictions give false confidence if mean errors are used, highlighting the importance of a holistic assessment of the results. We show that target representation affects the prediction accuracy, by constraining the prediction space. The literature is vague about quality issues in public transport data. Here we show that noisy data is a problem and discuss simple but effective approaches to address these issues. Research generally only focuses on a single method of target representation. Therefore, comparing several methods is a useful addition to the literature. This gives insight into the value of addressing data quality issues in urban transport data to enable better predictions and improve the passenger experience. We show that 'rephrasing' the prediction problem by changing the target representation can yield massively improved predictions. Our findings enable researchers using deep learning approaches in public transport to make more informed decisions about essential data cleaning steps and problem representation for improved results.  2020 IEEE.","Reich, Thilo; Budka, Marcin; Hulbert, David",10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308166,conferencePaper,GJZVXH2C,2020,,1

A machine-learning–based algorithm improves prediction of preeclampsia-associated adverse outcomes,NO,,,,"Background Preeclampsia presents a highly prevalent burden on pregnant women with an estimated incidence of 2% to 5%. Preeclampsia increases the maternal risk of death 20-fold and is one of the main causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Novel biomarkers, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor in addition to a wide span of conventional clinical data (medical history, physical symptoms, laboratory parameters, etc.), present an excellent basis for the application of early-detection machine-learning models. Objective This study aimed to develop, train, and test an automated machine-learning model for the prediction of adverse outcomes in patients with suspected preeclampsia. Study Design Our real-world dataset of 1647 (2472 samples) women was retrospectively recruited from women who presented to the Department of Obstetrics at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, between July 2010 and March 2019. After standardization and data cleaning, we calculated additional features regarding the biomarkers soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor and sonography data (umbilical artery pulsatility index, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index, mean uterine artery pulsatility index), resulting in a total of 114 features. The target metric was the occurrence of adverse outcomes throughout the remaining pregnancy and 2 weeks after delivery. We trained 2 different models, a gradient-boosted tree and a random forest classifier. Hyperparameter training was performed using a grid search approach. All results were evaluated via a 10 × 10-fold cross-validation regimen. Results We obtained metrics for the 2 naive machine-learning models. A gradient-boosted tree model was performed with a positive predictive value of 88%±6%, a negative predictive value of 89%±3%, a sensitivity of 66%±5%, a specificity of 97%±2%, an overall accuracy of 89%±3%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82±0.03, an F1 score of 0.76±0.04, and a threat score of 0.61±0.05. The random forest classifier returned an equal positive predictive value (88%±6%) and specificity (97%±1%) while performing slightly inferior on the other available metrics. Applying differential cutoffs instead of a naive cutoff for positive prediction at ≥0.5 for the classifier’s results yielded additional increases in performance. Conclusion Machine-learning techniques were a valid approach to improve the prediction of adverse outcomes in pregnant women at high risk of preeclampsia vs current clinical standard techniques. Furthermore, we presented an automated system that did not rely on manual tuning or adjustments.","Schmidt, Leon J.; Rieger, Oliver; Neznansky, Mark; Hackelöer, Max; Dröge, Lisa A.; Henrich, Wolfgang; Higgins, David; Verlohren, Stefan",10.1016/j.ajog.2022.01.026,journalArticle,SNDN86FE,2022,,1
AutoBlock: A hands-off blocking framework for entity matching,YES,ML4DC,any,el,"Entity matching seeks to identify data records over one or multiple data sources that refer to the same real-world entity. Virtually every entity matching task on large datasets requires blocking, a step that reduces the number of record pairs to be matched.

In this paper, we propose AutoBlock, a novel hands-off blocking framework for entity matching, based on similarity-preserving representation learning and nearest neighbor search. Our contributions include: (a) Automation: AutoBlock frees users from laborious data cleaning and blocking key tuning. (b) Scalability: AutoBlock has a sub-quadratic total time complexity and can be easily deployed for millions of records.

Compression of solar spectroscopic observations: A case study of Mg II k spectral line profiles observed by NASAs IRIS satellite,NO,,,,"In this study we extract the deep features and investigate the compression of the Mg II k spectral line profiles observed in quiet Sun regions by NASAs IRIS satellite. The data set of line profiles used for the analysis was obtained on April 20th, 2020, at the center of the solar disc, and contains almost 300,000 individual Mg II k line profiles after data cleaning. The data are separated into train and test subsets. The train subset was used to train the autoencoder of the varying embedding layer size. The early stopping criterion was implemented on the test subset to prevent the model from overfitting. Our results indicate that it is possible to compress the spectral line profiles more than 27 times (which corresponds to the reduction of the data dimensionality from 110 to 4) while having a 4 DN (Data Number) average reconstruction error, which is comparable to the variations in the line continuum. The mean squared error and the reconstruction error of even statistical moments sharply decrease when the dimensionality of the embedding layer increases from 1 to 4 and almost stop decreasing for higher numbers. The observed occasional improvements in training for values higher than 4 indicate that a better compact embedding may potentially be obtained if other training strategies and longer training times are used. The features learned for the critical four-dimensional case can be interpreted. In particular, three of these four features mainly control the line width, line asymmetry, and line dip formation respectively. The presented results are the first attempt to obtain a compact embedding for spectroscopic line profiles and confirm the value of this approach, in particular for feature extraction, data compression, and denoising.

Calculation method of damage effects of underground engineering objectives based on data mining technology,NO,,,,"Aiming at low calculation accuracy of damage effect caused by less data, uneven, discontinuity and narrow distribution of damage experimental data, data mining technology is introduced to calculate damage effect. The database manages damage metadata and the data cleaning technology is used to identify and eliminate dead points' data in order to control the data quality in database. An algorithm evaluation method is established to select the optimal empirical algorithm. The dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional damage data is achieved through feature selection and the main control parameters are chosen to train neural network model and k-nearest neighbor search. The ""three-stage"" damage effects calculation model based on data fusion has been established. The model can be used to calculate weapon damage effect based on experimental data, the empirical algorithm and the BP neural network model. The software has been developed to complete the damage calculation, and the results shows that the proposed method can meet the needs of practical application.  2021, Editorial Staff of EXPLOSION AND SHOCK WAVES.

T-LSTM: A Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Enhanced by Temporal Information for Traffic Flow Prediction,NO,,,,"Short-term traffic flow prediction is one of the most important issues in the field of intelligent transportation systems. It plays an important role in traffic information service and traffic guidance. However, complex traffic systems are highly nonlinear and stochastic, making short-term traffic flow prediction a challenging issue. Although long short-term memory (LSTM) has a good performance in traffic flow prediction, the impact of temporal features on prediction has not been exploited by existing studies. In this paper, a temporal information enhancing LSTM (T-LSTM) is proposed to predict traffic flow of a single road section. In view of the similar characteristics of traffic flow at the same time each day, the model can improve prediction accuracy by capturing the intrinsic correlation between traffic flow and temporal information. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the prediction performance and obtain higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel missing data processing technique based on T-LSTM. According to the experimental results, this technique can well restore the characteristics of original data and improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction.","Mou, LT; Zhao, PF; Xie, HT; Chen, YY",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929692,journalArticle,Z6JKH2LB,2019,,1

Parallel String Similarity Join Approach Based on CPU-GPU Heterogeneous Architecture,NO,,,,"Similarity join is an important task in data cleaning, data integration and other fields, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. With the increasing amount of data, the improvement of real-time processing requirement and the bottleneck of CPU performance improvement, the traditional serial algorithms of similarity join have been unable to meet the requirement of current big data processing. As a co-processor, GPU has achieved good acceleration results in machine learning and other fields in recent years. It is of great practical significance to study the parallel similarity join algorithms based on GPU. This paper proposes a parallel similarity join algorithm based on CPU-GPU heterogeneous architecture. Firstly, GPU is used to construct inverted index based on SoA (struct of arrays), which solves the problem of low efficiency of traditional index structure in parallel reading and writing. Then, to address the performance problem of serial algorithms, a parallel dual-length filtering algorithm based on filter-verification framework is proposed. Inverted index and prefix filtering algorithm are used to further improve the filtering performance. And in our approach, the calculation for exact similarity verification is performed by CPU to make full use of heterogeneous computing resources of CPU-GPU. Finally, experiments are carried out on several datasets. Compared with the serial similarity join algorithms, the results show that our proposed algorithms have better filtering performance and lower index generation time than existing algorithms, and also have better processing performance and higher speedup ratio on the similarity join.  2021, Science Press.

Machine Learning based Intelligent Framework for Data Preprocessing,NO,,,,"Data preprocessing having a pivotal role in data mining ensures reduction in cost by catering inconsistent, incomplete and irrelevant data through data cleansing to assist knowledge workers in making effective decisions through knowledge extraction. Prevalent techniques are not much effective for having more manual effort, increased processing time, less accuracy percentage etc with constrained data volumes. In this research, a comprehensive, semi-automatic preprocessing framework based on hybrid of two machine learning techniques namely Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is devised for data cleansing. Proposed framework is envisaged to be effective and flexible enough to manipulate data set of any size. A bucket of inconsistent dataset (comprising of customer's address directory) of Pakistan Telecommunication Company (PTCL) is used to conduct different experiments for training and validation of proposed approach. Small percentage of semi cleansed data (output of preprocessing) is passed to hybrid of HMM and CRF for learning and rest of the data is used for testing the model. Experiments depict superiority of higher average accuracy of 95.50% for proposed hybrid approach compared to CRF (84.5%) and HMM (88.6%) when applied in separately.","Sarwar, S; Qayyum, ZU; Kaleem, A",,journalArticle,LAEMFUPY,2018,,1

Machine Learning for Predicting Employee Attrition,NO,,,,"Employee attrition has become a focus of researchers and human resources because of the effects of poor performance on organizations regardless of geography, industry, or size. In this context, the use of machine learning classification models to predict whether an employee is likely to quit could greatly increase the human resource department's ability to intervene on time and possibly provide a remedy to the situation to prevent attrition. This study is conducted with an objective to compare the performance machine learning techniques, namely, Decision Tree (DT) classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) classifier, and select the best model. These machine learning techniques are compared using the IBM Human Resource Analytic Employee Attrition and Performance dataset. Preprocessing steps for the dataset used in this comparative study include data exploration, data visualization, data cleaning and reduction, data transformation, discretization, and feature selection. In this study, parameter tuning and regularization techniques to overcome overfitting issues are applied for optimization purposes. The comparative study conducted on the three classifiers found that the optimized SVM model stood as the best model that can be used to predict employee attrition with the highest accuracy percentage of 88.87% as compared to the other classification models experimented with, followed by ANN and DT.  2021.

Exploiting Error-Correction-CRC for Polar SCL Decoding: A Deep Learning-Based Approach,NO,,,,"We investigate the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes aided successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding schemes to improve the performance of Polar codes. Distinguished from the existing literatures of Polar codes that only consider the error detection capability of CRC, we attempt to take advantage of the inherent error correction capability of CRC and we first devise a segmented CRC-error-correcting aided SCL decoding (SCC-SCL) framework. Based on this framework, an error-correcting table based SCC-SCL (ET-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme is proposed, by introducing the look-up-table based CRC error correction method into the segmented Polar SCL decoding process. Since the error correction capability is limited by the size of the look-up table, which in turn limits the performance gain, we further propose a deep learning based SCC-SCL (DL-SCC-SCL) decoding scheme. In this scheme, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network replaces the error correction table to perform error correction, combining the sequence of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) with the syndromes to determine the error patterns. Simulation results show that both of the proposed decoding schemes have significant performance gain over the classic CRC error-detection aided SCL decoding scheme. Especially for the DL-SCC-SCL, the performance gain at bit error rate of 10-5 is about 0.5 dB.  2015 IEEE.","Liu, Xijin; Wu, Shaohua; Wang, Ye; Zhang, Ning; Jiao, Jian; Zhang, Qinyu",10.1109/TCCN.2019.2946358,journalArticle,DSUBVLRJ,2020,,1
Robust deep learning ensemble against deception,NO,,,,"Deep neural network (DNN) models are known to be vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial examples and to out-of-distribution inputs drawn sufficiently far away from the training data. How to protect a machine learning model against deception of both types of destructive inputs remains an open challenge. This paper presents XEnsemble, a diversity ensemble verification methodology for enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNN models against deception caused by either adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble by design has three unique capabilities. First, XEnsemble builds diverse input denoising verifiers by leveraging different data cleaning techniques. Second, XEnsemble develops a disagreement-diversity ensemble learning methodology for guarding the output of the prediction model against deception. Third, XEnsemble provides a suite of algorithms to combine input verification and output verification to protect the DNN prediction models from both adversarial examples and out of distribution inputs. Evaluated using eleven popular adversarial attacks and two representative out-of-distribution datasets, we show that XEnsemble achieves a high defense success rate against adversarial examples and a high detection success rate against out-of-distribution data inputs, and outperforms existing representative defense methods with respect to robustness and defensibility.

Data Cleansing for Salt Dome Dataset With Noise Robust Network on Segmentation Task,Specific,,,,"Noisy labels seriously degrade the performance of the deep learning models. Especially on segmentation tasks, labels are represented at pixel level, and therefore, it is easier to generate them as noisy labels. In this letter, we aim to cleanse the dataset which contains noisy labels using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence algorithm and noise robust loss function. Here, we regard the whole dataset as noisy labels and separate noisy labels into two different parts. One is the strong noisy labels where there are the most noisy labels, which is referred to as incorrect labels, and the other is The weak noisy labels where pixels are incorrect in some parts of the image. The KL algorithm is more efficient in removing the labels which contain the most noise. At the same time, we use noise robust model to remove the labels where pixels are inaccurate only in small parts of the image. Noise robust loss function is robust to noisy labels, and thus, we consider noisy labels when intersection over union (IoU) is lower than a constant threshold despite using noise robust loss function. The effectiveness of our proposed method is assessed using Kaggle's TGS Salt Identification Challenge dataset. We have demonstrated that using our method, segmentation performance is increased without heavy noisy labels.  2004-2012 IEEE.","Chung, Youdam; Lu, Wenkai; Tian, Xingyu",10.1109/LGRS.2022.3170497,journalArticle,KFGFDM9W,2022,,1

"Ease.ML/Snoopy: Towards Automatic Feasibility Studies for ML via Quantitative Understanding of ""Data Quality for ML""",related,,,,"In our experience of working with domain experts who are using today's AutoML systems, a common problem we encountered is what we call ""unrealistic expectations"" - when users are facing a very challenging task with a noisy data acquisition process, while being expected to achieve startlingly high accuracy with machine learning (ML). Many of these are predestined to fail from the beginning. In traditional software engineering, this problem is addressed via a feasibility study, an indispensable step before developing any software system. In this paper, we present Snoopy, with the goal of supporting data scientists and machine learning engineers performing a systematic and theoretically founded feasibility study before building ML applications. We approach this problem by estimating the irreducible error of the underlying task, also known as the Bayes error rate (BER), which stems from data quality issues in datasets used to train or evaluate ML model artifacts. We design a practical Bayes error estimator that is compared against baseline feasibility study candidates on 6 datasets (with additional real and synthetic noise of different levels) in computer vision and natural language processing. Furthermore, by including our systematic feasibility study with additional signals into the iterative label cleaning process, we demonstrate in end-to-end experiments how users are able to save substantial labeling time and monetary efforts.

Overcoming Stealthy Adversarial Attacks on Power Grid Load Predictions Through Dynamic Data Repair,Specific,,,,"For power distribution networks with connected smart meters, current advances in machine learning enable the service provider to utilize data flows from smart meters for load forecasting using deep neural networks. However, recent research shows that current machine learning algorithms for power systems can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are small designed perturbations crafted on normal inputs that can greatly affect the overall performance of the predictor. Even with only a partial compromise of the network, an attacker could intercept and adversarially modify data from some smart meters in a limited range to make the load predictor deviate from normal prediction results. In this paper, we leverage the dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS) paradigm and propose a novel data repair framework to defend against these kinds of adversarial attacks. This framework complements the predictor with a self-representative auto-encoder and works in an iterative manner. The auto-encoder is used to detect and reconstruct the likely adversarial part in the input data. Different reconstruction results come up given different sensitivity levels in detection. As new data flows in each iterative time step, the service provider continuously checks the error of the previous prediction step and dynamically trades off between different detection sensitivity levels to seek an overall stable data reconstruction. Case studies on power network load forecast regression demonstrate the vulnerability of current machine learning algorithms and correspondingly the effectiveness of our defense framework.  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zhou, Xingyu; Canady, Robert; Li, Yi; Koutsoukos, Xenofon; Gokhale, Aniruddha",10.1007/978-3-030-61725-7_14,conferencePaper,2H8RDGXJ,2020,,1

Spread the good around! information propagation in schema matching and entity resolution for heterogeneous data,wrong format,,,,"In this short paper we describe the experience from our entries to the Entity Resolution (ER) and Schema Matching (SM) challenges of the Second DI2KG workshop. Altogether we study four solutions, two domain-specific and two based on machine learning (ML). Concerning ER, we find that through ample data cleaning/extraction, simple matching rules can already achieve a high f1 score (0.921). However, we note the limited generalization power of such kind of solutions. For ML-ER, by reducing data cleaning/extraction, generic ML models resulted unsuccessful out of the box; but by increasing it, models resulted redundant compared to simple rules. For SM, we report less competitive f1 scores, establishing the need for more appropriate methods than those attempted. Based on our experience we confirm the importance of automating data cleaning/extraction as a goal towards general data integration methods that would be more portable across datasets. We venture that for highly heterogeneous schemas, a promising approach could be to evolve collective integration with ML & graph-based methods, incorporating strategies based on information propagation.

Deep transfer learning for multi-source entity linkage via domain adaptation,YES,ML4DC,?,el,"Multi-source entity linkage focuses on integrating knowledge from multiple sources by linking the records that represent the same real world entity. This is critical in high-impact applications such as data cleaning and user stitching. The state-of-the-art entity linkage pipelines mainly depend on supervised learning that requires abundant amounts of training data. However, collecting well-labeled training data becomes expensive when the data from many sources arrives incrementally over time. Moreover, the trained models can easily overfit to specific data sources, and thus fail to generalize to new sources due to significant differences in data and label distributions. To address these challenges, we present AdaMEL, a deep transfer learning framework that learns generic high-level knowledge to perform multi-source entity linkage. AdaMEL models the attribute importance that is used to match entities through an attribute-level self-attention mechanism, and leverages the massive unlabeled data from new data sources through domain adaptation to make it generic and data-source agnostic. In addition, AdaMEL is capable of incorporating an additional set of labeled data to more accurately integrate data sources with different attribute importance. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results with 8.21% improvement on average over methods based on supervised learning. Besides, it is more stable in handling different sets of data sources in less runtime. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Multimodal analysis: Informed content estimation and audio source separation,NO,,,,"This dissertation proposes the study of multimodal learning in the context of musical signals. Throughout, we focus on the interaction between audio signals and text information. Among the many text sources related to music that can be used (e.g. reviews, metadata, or social network feedback), we concentrate on lyrics. The singing voice directly connects the audio signal and the text information in a unique way, combining melody and lyrics where a linguistic dimension complements the abstraction of musical instruments. Our study focuses on the audio and lyrics interaction for targeting source separation and informed content estimation. Real-world stimuli are produced by complex phenomena and their constant interaction in various domains. Our understanding learns useful abstractions that fuse different modalities into a joint representation. Multimodal learning describes methods that analyse phenomena from different modalities and their interaction in order to tackle complex tasks. This results in better and richer representations that improve the performance of the current machine learning methods. To develop our multimodal analysis, we need first to address the lack of data containing singing voice with aligned lyrics. This data is mandatory to develop our ideas. Therefore, we investigate how to create such a dataset automatically leveraging resources from the World Wide Web. Creating this type of dataset is a challenge in itself that raises many research questions. We are constantly working with the classic ""chicken or the egg"" problem: acquiring and cleaning this data requires accurate models, but it is difficult to train models without data. We propose to use the teacher-student paradigm to develop a method where dataset creation and model learning are not seen as independent tasks but rather as complementary efforts. In this process, non-expert karaoke time-aligned lyrics and notes describe the lyrics as a sequence of time-aligned notes with their associated textual information. We then link each annotation to the correct audio and globally align the annotations to it. For this purpose, we use the normalized cross-correlation between the voice annotation sequence and the singing voice probability vector automatically, which is obtained using a deep convolutional neural network. Using the collected data we progressively improve that model. Every time we have an improved version, we can in turn correct and enhance the data. Collecting data from the Internet comes with a price and it is error-prone. We propose a novel data cleansing (a well-studied topic for cleaning erroneous labels in datasets) to identify automatically any errors which remain, allowing us to estimate the overall accuracy of the dataset, select points that are correct, and improve erroneous data. Our model is trained by automatically contrasting likely correct label pairs against local deformations of them. We demonstrate that the accuracy of a transcription model improves greatly when trained on filtered data with our proposed strategy compared with the accuracy when trained using the original dataset. After developing the dataset, we center our efforts in exploring the interaction between lyrics and audio in two different tasks. First, we improve lyric segmentation by combining lyrics and audio using a model-agnostic early fusion approach. As a pre-processing step, we create a coordinate representation as self-similarity matrices (SMMs) of the same dimensions for both domains. This allows us to easy adapt an existing deep neural model to capture the structure of both domains. Through experiments, we show that each domain captures complementary information that benefit the overall performance. Secondly, we explore the problem of music source separation (i.e. to isolate the different instruments that appear in an audio mixture) using conditioned learning. In this paradigm, we aim to effectively control data-driven models by context information. We present a novel approach based on the U-Net that implements conditioned learning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). We first formalise the problem as a multitask source separation using weak conditioning. In this scenario, our method performs several instrument separations with a single model without losing performance, adding just a small number of parameters. This shows that we can effectively control a generic neural network with some external information. We then hypothesize that knowing the aligned phonetic information is beneficial for the vocal separation task and investigate how we can integrate conditioning mechanisms into informed-source separation using strong conditioning. We adapt the FiLM technique for improving vocal source separation once we know the aligned phonetic sequence. We show that our strategy outperforms the standard non-conditioned architecture. Finally, we summarise our contributions highlighting the main research questions we approach and our proposed answers. We discuss in detail potential future work, addressing each task individually. We propose new use cases of our dataset as well as ways of improving its reliability, and analyze our conditional approach and the different strategies to improve it.  2021, CC BY-NC-SA.","Meseguer Brocal, Gabriel",,journalArticle,YPL77TPF,2021,,1

TDTD: Thyroid Disease Type Diagnostics,NO,,,,"Recently; medical data mining has become one of the well-established research areas of machine learning and AI base techniques have been used to solve the complex classification problem of thyroid disease. Due to the existence of non-palpable nodules it is very hard to detect the structural changes of thyroid disease by assessing the thyroid functional changes. For instance at structural level ""Euthyroid"" is normal thyroid hormonal functional state but this would be involved in initial structural changes such as goiter, cold nodule, MNG (multiple nodule goiter) and cancer (Grave's Disease and so on). The ideal system should not only identify all the thyroid disease types but also recommend state of structural levels; otherwise it would be converted into serious disease, such like cancer. In-order to mitigate such problems, this paper proposes a framework TDTD (Thyroid Disease Types Diagnostics) that aims to assist the physicians during the diagnostic process of thyroid diseases in a very structured and transparent manner. Proposed system TDTD presents a novel method MDC (Medical data cleaning) for filling of missing values in medical datasets by building classifier based upon the Bayesian isotonic regression algorithm because missing values of medical data (i.e. blood tests) are different in nature and they could not be filled with normal procedures. In second phase two classifiers are trained to classify the functional and structural levels of thyroid disease at granular level using multi and binary SVM (support vector machine) algorithms, in final phase performance and evaluation is approximated using confusion matrix, precision and recall measures.","Ahmed, J; Soomrani, MAR; IEEE",,conferencePaper,FHIPT8Y8,2016,,1

Study on Precise Temperature Control Method of Hot-rolled Ribbed Bar during Cooling Process,NO,,,,"Aiming at the demand for performance control in the production process of hot-rolled ribbed bar, the finite difference method was used to establish a temperature prediction model during the cooling process. The calculation accuracy of the temperature model depends to a large extent on the selection of heat transfer coefficient. In this study, the industrial production data was cleaned and screened by the clustering algorithm to obtain training sample data, and based on BP neural networks, the mapping relationship between different influencing factors and heat transfer coefficient was established. According to the change of production conditions, the heat transfer coefficient is learned adaptively, which improves the prediction accuracy of the model. By comparing the predicted and actual temperature values over a period of time, the deviation between most predicted and actual values is less than 20C, and the deviation is reduced by about 30C compared with that before the BP network was used to study the heat transfer coefficient. Under the constraints of the target temperature and the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the section, the precise control of the cooling temperature of the hot-rolled ribbed bar is realized by the calculation of the temperature prediction model.",Jie Li; Chunyu He; Xianming Zhao; Zhiqiang Wu,10.1088/1755-1315/585/1/012111,conferencePaper,WX446J2P,2020,,1
Data readiness report,related,,,,"Data exploration and quality analysis is an important yet tedious process in the AI pipeline. Current data cleaning and data readiness assessment practices for machine learning tasks are mostly conducted in an arbitrary manner which limits their reuse and often results in loss of productivity. We introduce the concept of a Data Readiness Report as accompanying documentation to a dataset that allows data consumers to get detailed insights into the quality of data. Data characteristics and challenges on various quality dimensions are identified and documented, keeping in mind the principles of transparency and explainability. The Data Readiness Report also serves as a record of all data assessment operations, including applied transformations. This provides a detailed lineage for data governance and management. In effect, the report captures and documents the actions taken by various personas in a data readiness and assessment workflow. Over time this becomes a repository of best practices and can potentially drive a recommendation system for building automated data readiness workflows on the lines of AutoML [1]. The data readiness report could serve as a valuable asset for organizing and operationalizing data in a Data-as-a-service model as it augments the trust and reliability of the datasets. We anticipate that together with the Datasheets [2], Dataset Nutrition Label [3], FactSheets [4] and Model Cards [5], the Data Readiness Report completes the AI documentation pipeline and increases trust and re-useability of data. 2021 IEEE","Afzal, Shazia; Rajmohan, C.; Kesarwani, Manish; Mehta, Sameep; Patel, Hima",10.1109/SMDS53860.2021.00016,conferencePaper,7INHSTTU,2021,,1

CORDEL: A contrastive deep learning approach for entity linkage,YES,ML4DC,?,el,"Entity linkage (EL) is a critical problem in data cleaning and integration. In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CORDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CORDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CORDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2% on public benchmark datasets. Moreover, CORDEL yields a 2.4% improvement over the current best DL model on the real-world dataset, while reducing the number of training parameters by 97.6%. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Noisy labels are treasure: Mean-teacher-assisted confident learning for hepatic vessel segmentation,Specific,,,,"Manually segmenting the hepatic vessels from Computer Tomography (CT) is far more expertise-demanding and laborious than other structures due to the low-contrast and complex morphology of vessels, resulting in the extreme lack of high-quality labeled data. Without sufficient high-quality annotations, the usual data-driven learning-based approaches struggle with deficient training. On the other hand, directly introducing additional data with low-quality annotations may confuse the network, leading to undesirable performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel mean-teacher-assisted confident learning framework to robustly exploit the noisy labeled data for the challenging hepatic vessel segmentation task. Specifically, with the adapted confident learning assisted by a third party, i.e., the weight-averaged teacher model, the noisy labels in the additional low-quality dataset can be transformed from encumbrance' to 'treasure' via progressive pixel-wise soft-correction, thus providing productive guidance. Extensive experiments using two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework as well as the effectiveness of each component. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

"Public perception of COVID-19 vaccines from the digital footprints left on Twitter: analyzing positive, neutral and negative sentiments of Twitterati",NO,,,,"Purpose Twitter is gaining popularity as a microblogging and social networking service to discuss various social issues. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and is discussed worldwide. Social media is an instant platform to deliberate various dimensions of COVID-19. The purpose of the study is to explore and analyze the public sentiments related to COVID-19 vaccines across the Twitter messages (positive, neutral, and negative) and the impact tweets make across digital social circles. Design/methodology/approach To fetch the vaccine-related posts, a manual examination of randomly selected 500 tweets was carried out to identify the popular hashtags relevant to the vaccine conversation. It was found that the hashtags ""covid19vaccine"" and ""coronavirusvaccine"" were the two popular hashtags used to discuss the communications related to COVID-19 vaccines. 23,575 global tweets available in public domain were retrieved through ""Twitter Application Programming Interface"" (API), using ""Orange Software"", an open-source machine learning, data visualization and data mining toolkit. The study was confined to the tweets posted in English language only. The default data cleaning and preprocessing techniques available in the ""Orange Software"" were applied to the dataset, which include ""transformation"", ""tokenization"" and ""filtering"". The ""Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning"" (VADER) tool was used for classification of tweets to determine the tweet sentiments (positive, neutral and negative) as well as the degree of sentiments (compound score also known as sentiment score). To assess the influence/impact of tweets account wise (verified and unverified) and sentiment wise (positive, neutral, and negative), the retweets and likes, which offer a sort of reward or acknowledgment of tweets, were used. Findings A gradual decline in the number of tweets over the time is observed. Majority (11,205; 47.52%) of tweets express positive sentiments, followed by neutral (7,948; 33.71%) and negative sentiments (4,422; 18.75%), respectively. The study also signifies a substantial difference between the impact of tweets tweeted by verified and unverified users. The tweets related to verified users have a higher impact both in terms of retweets (65.91%) and likes (84.62%) compared to the tweets tweeted by unverified users. Tweets expressing positive sentiments have the highest impact both in terms of likes (mean = 10.48) and retweets (mean = 3.07) compared to those that express neutral or negative sentiments. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of the study is that the sentiments of the people expressed over one single social platform, that is, Twitter have been studied which cannot generalize the global public perceptions. There can be a variation in the results when the datasets from other social media platforms will be studied. Practical implications The study will help to know the people's sentiments and beliefs toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Sentiments that people hold about the COVID-19 vaccines are studied, which will help health policymakers understand the polarity (positive, negative, and neutral) of the tweets and thus see the public reaction and reflect the types of information people are exposed to about vaccines. The study can aid the health sectors to intensify positive messages and eliminate negative messages for an enhanced vaccination uptake. The research can also help design more operative vaccine-advocating communication by customizing messages using the obtained knowledge from the sentiments and opinions about the vaccines. Originality/value The paper focuses on an essential aspect of COVID-19 vaccines and how people express themselves (positively, neutrally and negatively) on Twitter.","Mir, AA; Rathinam, S; Gul, S",10.1108/LHT-08-2021-0261,journalArticle,BUMIADZ9,0,,1

A rigorous machine learning analysis pipeline for biomedical binary classification: Applications in pancreatic cancer nested case-control studies with implications for bias assessments,NO,,,,"Machine learning (ML) offers a collection of powerful approaches for detecting and modeling associations, often applied to data having a large number of features and/or complex patterns of association. Currently, there are many tools to facilitate the implementation and application of custom ML analyses (e.g. the scikit-learn library in Python). There is also increasing interest in automated ML packages, which can make it easier for non-experts to apply ML and have the potential to improve model performance. ML has made its way into most subfields of biomedical research with varying levels of rigor and correct usage. The tremendous opportunities offered by ML are frequently offset by the challenge of assembling a comprehensive analysis pipeline, and the ease of ML misuse, e.g. failing to investigate underlying biases in data sources. In this work we have laid out and assembled a complete, rigorous ML analysis pipeline focused on binary classification (i.e. case/control prediction), and applied this pipeline to both simulated and real world data. At a high level, thisautomated but customizable pipeline includes a) exploratory analysis, b) data cleaning and transformation, c) feature selection, d) model training with 9 established ML algorithms, each with hyperparameter optimization, and e) thorough evaluation, including appropriate metrics, statistical analyses, and novel visualizations. This pipeline organizes the many subtle complexities of ML pipeline assembly to illustrate best practices to avoid bias and ensure reproducibility. Additionally, this pipeline is the first to compare established ML algorithms toExSTraCS, a rule-based ML algorithm with the unique capability of interpretably modeling heterogeneous patterns of association. While designed to be widely applicable we apply this pipeline to an epidemiological investigation of established and newly identified risk factors for pancreatic cancer to evaluate how different sources of bias might be handled by ML algorithms.

Application of data-driven models to predictive maintenance: Bearing wear prediction at TATA steel,NO,,,,"Industries that are in transition to Industry 4.0 often face challenges in applying data-driven methods to improve performance. While ample methods are available in literature, knowledge on how to select and apply them is scarce. This study aims to address this gap reported on the design and implementation of data-driven models for predictive maintenance at TATA Steel, Shotton. The objective of the project is to predict the wearing behaviour of the components in the steel production line for maintenance activity decision support. To achieve the predictive maintenance goal, the approach applied can be summarized as follows: 1. business understanding and data collection, 2. literature review, 3. data preparation and exploration, 4. modelling and result analysis and 5. conclusion and recommendation. The data-driven methods that were analysed and compared are: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Artificial Neu- ral Network (ANN) and Random Forest(RF). After cleaning and analysing the production line data, predictive maintenance with the current available data in TATA Steel, Shotton is best feasible with PLSR.

Sato: Contextual semantic type detection in tables,NO,,,,"Detecting the semantic types of data columns in relational tables is important for various data preparation and information retrieval tasks such as data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, and semantic search. However, existing detection approaches either perform poorly with dirty data, support only a limited number of semantic types, fail to incorporate the table context of columns or rely on large sample sizes for training data. We introduce Sato, a hybrid machine learning model to automatically detect the semantic types of columns in tables, exploiting the signals from the table context as well as the column values. Sato combines a deep learning model trained on a large-scale table corpus with topic modeling and structured prediction to achieve support-weighted and macro average F1 scores of 0.925 and 0.735, respectively, exceeding the state-of-theart performance by a significant margin. We extensively analyze the overall and per-type performance of Sato, discussing how individual modeling components, as well as feature categories, contribute to its performance.  2020, VLDB Endowment.","Zhang, Dan; Suhara, Yoshihiko; Li, Jinfeng; Hulsebos, Madelon; Demiralp, Caatay; Tan, Wang Chiew",10.14778/3407790.3407793,journalArticle,LQ23GLTA,2020,,1
IoT Traffic Multi-Classification Using Network and Statistical Features in a Smart Environment,NO,,,,"As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications increases, the capacity of the IoT access networks is considerably stressed. This can create significant performance bottlenecks in various layers of an end-to-end communication path, including the scheduling of the spectrum, the resource requirements for processing the IoT data at the Edge and/or Cloud, and the attainable delay for critical emergency scenarios. Thus, it is required to classify or predict the time varying traffic characteristics of the IoT devices. However, this classification remains at large an open challenge. Most of the existing solutions are based on machine learning techniques, which nonetheless present high computational cost while non considering the fine-grained flow characteristics. To this end, in this paper we design a two-stage classification framework that utilizes both the network and statistical features to characterize the IoT devices in the context of a smart city. We firstly perform the data cleaning and preprocessing of the data and then analyze the dataset to extract the network and statistical features set for different types of IoT devices.

ROC-based performance evaluation of data cleansing techniques for false alarm risk reduction in continuously monitored bridges,Specific,,,,"Maintenance and prevention of roadway bridges is an important societal and economic challenge where structural health monitoring systems can play a major role. The main reason lies in the significant number of ageing infrastructures requiring a strategy to evaluate their structural integrity and durability as well as to enable structural prognosis. In the context of unsupervised learning processes, damage detection can be accomplished by tracking deviations of dynamic parameters from their normal conditions using specific tools, named control charts. However, the main drawback of dealing with changes in modal properties is represented by their high sensitivity to environmental and operational factors. It follows that these effects must be necessarily removed to obtain suitable damage sensitive features. In this regard, the selection of a particular statistical model for data cleansing inevitably influences the distribution of the residuals, the control chart and therefore the damage detection. To overcome this issue, in the present paper an original methodology is developed, based on Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which provides a new decision-support tool for the definition of the best environmental effects' removal technique. Residuals stemming from the application of different data cleansing methods, plotted in control charts are conceivably distinguished in False Positives, True Positives, False Negatives and True Negatives. Consequently, ROC curves are computed and compared, each one referred to a particular data cleansing procedure, among which Principal Component Analysis, Multiple Linear Regression and more and to a specific damage class. The proposed approach is applied in the illustrative case study of the Z24 Bridge, located in the canton Bern near Solothurn, Switzerland. The results of the application of the procedure demonstrated that ROC curves are a suitable tool for defining the optimal damage threshold and the most effective environmental effects' removal technique, in order to minimize the occurrence of false alarms.  2021 COMPDYN Proceedings.","Giglioni, Valentina; Garcia-Macias, Enrique; Venanzi, Ilaria; Ierimonti, Laura; Ubertini, Filippo",,conferencePaper,Q59LDUDJ,2021,,1
Improved Machine Reading Comprehension Using Data Validation for Weakly Labeled Data,NO,,,,"Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a natural language processing task wherein a given question is answered according to a holistic understanding of a given context. Recently, many researchers have shown interest in MRC, for which a considerable number of datasets are being released. Datasets for MRC, which are composed of the context-query-answer triple, are designed to answer a given query by referencing and understanding a readily-available, relevant context text. The TriviaQA dataset is a weakly labeled dataset, because it contains irrelevant context that forms no basis for answering the query. The existing syntactic data cleaning method struggles to deal with the contextual noise this irrelevancy creates. Therefore, a semantic data cleaning method using reasoning processes is necessary. To address this, we propose a new MRC model in which the TriviaQA dataset is validated and trained using a high-quality dataset. The data validation method in our MRC model improves the quality of the training dataset, and the answer extraction model learns with the validated training data, because of our validation method. Our proposed method showed a 4.33% improvement in performance for the TriviaQA Wiki, compared to the existing baseline model. Accordingly, our proposed method can address the limitation of irrelevant context in MRC better than the human supervision.",Yunyeong Yang; Sangwoo Kang; Jungyun Seo,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963569,journalArticle,KRY9GK4D,2020,,1

Entity Matching withString Transformation andSimilarity-Based Features,NO,,,,"Entity matching is an important task in common data cleaning and data integration problems of determining two records that refer to the same real-world entity. Many research use string similarity as features to infer entity matching but the power of the similarity may be affected by the pairs of hard-to-classify entities, which are actually different entities but have a high similarity or the same entity with low similarity. String transformation is a good solution to solve different representations between two domains of datasets, such as abbreviations, misspellings, and other expressions. In this paper, we propose two powerful features, similarity gain and dissimilarity gain, that enables us to discriminate whether the two entities refer to the same entity after string transformation. The similarity gain is defined by the maximum amount of similarity increase among the variations in similarity before and after applying string transformations. The dissimilarity is defined by the maximum amount of similarity decrease. Moreover, the similarity gain and dissimilarity gain can also be used for selecting valuable samples in a limited labeling budget. Sufficient experiments are conducted, and our method with the proposed features improves the best accuracy in most cases.  2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sakai, Kazunori; Dong, Yuyang; Oyamada, Masafumi; Takeoka, Kunihiro; Okadome, Takeshi",10.1007/978-3-030-93849-9_5,conferencePaper,RSGMD596,2022,,1

Analysis and Modeling of Sensor Data for Ship Motion Prediction,NO,,,,"This paper presents an analyzing and modeling scheme that can dig into the ship sensor data to generate models for ship motion prediction. As the raw sensor data contains information that is noisy and discontinuous, three data cleaning methods used for noise reduction, data continuing and resampling are developed. According to specific ship applications, various ship motion constraints are designed to filter and establish meaningful data sets which will be used in the modeling step. Correlation analysis within the data sets is performed to figure out how significant the sensor data contributes to the predictive target. An flexible neural network based modeling mechanism is implemented, in which the user can design the model based on the correlation analysis. By training and testing the neural network using the generated data sets, the ship motion predictive model is obtained.

Data-driven uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for ship motion modeling in offshore operations,NO,,,,"To build a compact data-driven ship motion model for offshore operations that require high control safety, it is necessary to select the most influential parameters and to analyze the uncertainty of the input parameters. This paper proposes a framework of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for ship motion data. The framework consists of four components: data cleaning, surrogate model, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, and results visualization. Data cleaning focuses on the removal of noise, and necessary transformation for the easy analysis. An artificial neural network (ANN) based surrogate model is constructed on the basis of cleaned ship motion data. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis would be performed on the sample or weights which the ANN based surrogate model generated. The result of the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can be beneficial to the optimization of data-driven ship motion models. Three distinctive sensitivity analysis (SA) methods (Garson/Morris/Sobol), and PDF-based and CDF-based uncertainty methods are investigated in two types of ship motion datasets with and without environmental factors. The experimental results also demonstrate the proposed framework can be applied to estimate the sensitivity and uncertainty in different datasets.","Cheng, Xu; Li, Guoyuan; Skulstad, Robert; Major, Pierre; Chen, Shengyong; Hildre, Hans Petter; Zhang, Houxiang",10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.03.014,journalArticle,IHKUQBQ2,2019,,1

Land cover classification through Convolutional Neur-al Network model assembly: A case study of a local rural area in Thailand,NO,,,,"Recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown great potential in image classification, segmentation and object detection. Land cover takes advantage of CNN development for a large type of applications as water management and urban growing. However, to perform a land cover with numerous features – classes in classical CNN terminology, CNN models require a significant number of layers and neurons, resulting in high computational costs. To address this problem, a methodology is proposed in this paper to build a land cover using the aggregation of several CNN models. The overall process is based on 7 steps. The first two steps are the dataset creation and arrangement in smaller dataset fit for the specific features to detect. Then, a CNN architecture is built and validated on each sub-dataset corresponding to each class. Post-processing is conducted on each prediction before assembling the results. In the last step, a data cleaning is performed, giving the final land cover. The land cover of a rural area in Thailand is performed as a demonstration of the method, using satellite images with a resolution of 0.15 m/pixel. A 5-class (buildings, crops, forests, roads, and wastelands) dataset is created, consisting of a total of 1 million tiles of 64 × 64 pixels. The prediction results using the developed CNN model show an accuracy greater than 90% for each class, except for the road class where the accuracy only reaches 72%. Post-processing is performed on each of the 5 predictions. Only the 4 best results are retained and assembled to obtain the land cover, which generally corresponds to buildings, crops, forests, and wastelands. This method enables to identify by substitution with improved accuracy the last class whose prediction is the least accurate, and which generally corresponds to roads due to their small width relative to the tile size. The proposed methodology to perform a land cover by aggregating the prediction of different CNN models is found to predict correctly the land cover of two areas, especially roads can be classified, demonstrating the usefulness of the approach.","Fitton, D.; Laurens, E.; Hongkarnjanakul, N.; Schwob, C.; Mezeix, L.",10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100740,journalArticle,BPADZJRD,2022,,1
A Machine-Learning-Based Technique for False Data Injection Attacks Detection in Industrial IoT,NO,,,,"The accelerated move toward the adoption of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) paradigm has resulted in numerous shortcomings as far as security is concerned. One of the IIoT affecting critical security threats is what is termed as the false data injection (FDI) attack. The FDI attacks aim to mislead the industrial platforms by falsifying their sensor measurements. FDI attacks have successfully overcome the classical threat detection approaches. In this article, we present a novel method of FDI attack detection using autoencoders (AEs). We exploit the sensor data correlation in time and space, which in turn can help identify the falsified data. Moreover, the falsified data are cleaned using the denoising AEs (DAEs). Performance evaluation proves the success of our technique in detecting FDI attacks. It also significantly outperforms a support vector machine (SVM)-based approach used for the same purpose. The DAE data cleaning algorithm is also shown to be very effective in recovering clean data from corrupted (attacked) data.  2014 IEEE.","Aboelwafa, Mariam M.

Embedded data imputation for environmental intelligent sensing: A case study,Specific,,,,"Recent developments in cloud computing and the Internet of Things have enabled smart environments, in terms of both monitoring and actuation. Unfortunately, this often results in unsus-tainable cloud-based solutions, whereby, in the interest of simplicity, a wealth of raw (unprocessed) data are pushed from sensor nodes to the cloud. Herein, we advocate the use of machine learning at sensor nodes to perform essential data-cleaning operations, to avoid the transmission of corrupted (often unusable) data to the cloud. Starting from a public pollution dataset, we investigate how two machine learning techniques (kNN and missForest) may be embedded on Raspberry Pi to perform data imputation, without impacting the data collection process. Our experimental results demon-strate the accuracy and computational efficiency of edge-learning methods for filling in missing data values in corrupted data series. We find that kNN and missForest correctly impute up to 40% of randomly distributed missing values, with a density distribution of values that is indistinguishable from the benchmark. We also show a trade-off analysis for the case of bursty missing values, with recoverable blocks of up to 100 samples. Computation times are shorter than sampling periods, allowing for data imputation at the edge in a timely manner.  2021 by the authors.

How to Address the Data Quality Issues in Regression Models: A Guided Process for Data Cleaning,YES,DC4ML,tabular,features,"Today, data availability has gone from scarce to superabundant. Technologies like IoT, trends in social media and the capabilities of smart-phones are producing and digitizing lots of data that was previously unavailable. This massive increase of data creates opportunities to gain new business models, but also demands new techniques and methods of data quality in knowledge discovery, especially when the data comes from different sources (e.g., sensors, social networks, cameras, etc.). The data quality process of the data set proposes conclusions about the information they contain. This is increasingly done with the aid of data cleaning approaches. Therefore, guaranteeing a high data quality is considered as the primary goal of the data scientist. In this paper, we propose a process for data cleaning in regression models (DC-RM). The proposed data cleaning process is evaluated through a real datasets coming from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases. With the aim of assessing the data cleaning process, the dataset that is cleaned by DC-RM was used to train the same regression models proposed by the authors of UCI datasets. The results achieved by the trained models with the dataset produced by DC-RM are better than or equal to that presented by the datasets' authors.","Corrales, D.C.; Corrales, J.C.; Ledezma, A.",10.3390/sym10040099,journalArticle,CTSHMHVY,2018,aug,1

Disease Concept-Embedding Based on the Self-Supervised Method for Medical Information Extraction from Electronic Health Records and Disease Retrieval: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,Specific,,,,"Background: The electronic health record (EHR) contains a wealth of medical information. An organized EHR can greatly help doctors treat patients. In some cases, only limited patient information is collected to help doctors make treatment decisions. Because EHRs can serve as a reference for this limited information, doctors' treatment capabilities can be enhanced. Natural language processing and deep learning methods can help organize and translate EHR information into medical knowledge and experience. Objective: In this study, we aimed to create a model to extract concept embeddings from EHRs for disease pattern retrieval and further classification tasks. Methods: We collected 1,040,989 emergency department visits from the National Taiwan University Hospital Integrated Medical Database and 305,897 samples from the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department data. After data cleansing and preprocessing, the data sets were divided into training, validation, and test sets. We proposed a Transformer-based model to embed EHRs and used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to extract features from free text and concatenate features with structural data as input to our proposed model. Then, Deep InfoMax (DIM) and Simple Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) were used for the unsupervised embedding of the disease concept. The pretrained disease concept-embedding model, named EDisease, was further finetuned to adapt to the critical care outcome prediction task. We evaluated the performance of embedding using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to perform dimension reduction for visualization The performance of the finetuned predictive model was evaluated against published models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). Results: The performance of our model on the outcome prediction had the highest AUROC of 0.876. In the ablation study, the use of a smaller data set or fewer unsupervised methods for pretraining deteriorated the prediction performance. The AUROCs were 0.857, 0.870, and 0.868 for the model without pretraining, the model pretrained by only SimCLR, and the model pretrained by only DIM, respectively. On the smaller finetuning set, the AUROC was 0.815 for the proposed model. Conclusions: Through contrastive learning methods, disease concepts can be embedded meaningfully. Moreover, these methods can be used for disease retrieval tasks to enhance clinical practice capabilities. The disease concept model is also suitable as a pretrained model for subsequent prediction tasks.","Chen, YP; Lo, YH; Lai, FP; Huang, CH",10.2196/25113,journalArticle,AUHWW99S,2021,,1

Design and Selection of Machine Learning Methods Using Radiomics and Dosiomics for Normal Tissue Complication Probability Modeling of Xerostomia,NO,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether machine learning with dosiomic, radiomic, and demographic features allows for xerostomia risk assessment more precise than normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models based on the mean radiation dose to parotid glands. Material and methods: A cohort of 153 head-and-neck cancer patients was used to model xerostomia at 0-6 months (early), 6-15 months (late), 15-24 months (long-term), and at any time (a longitudinal model) after radiotherapy. Predictive power of the features was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of univariate logistic regression models. The multivariate NTCP models were tuned and tested with single and nested cross-validation, respectively. We compared predictive performance of seven classification algorithms, six feature selection methods, and ten data cleaning/class balancing techniques using the Friedman test and the Nemenyi post hoc analysis. Results: NTCP models based on the parotid mean dose failed to predict xerostomia (AUCs < 0.60). The most informative predictors were found for late and long-term xerostomia. Late xerostomia correlated with the contralateral dose gradient in the anterior posterior (AUC = 0.72) and the right left (AUC = 0.68) direction, whereas long-term xerostomia was associated with parotid volumes (AUCs > 0.85), dose gradients in the right left (AUCs > 0.78), and the anterior posterior (AUCs > 0.72) direction. Multivariate models of long-term xerostomia were typically based on the parotid volume, the parotid eccentricity, and the dose volume histogram (DVH) spread with the generalization AUCs ranging from 0.74 to 0.88. On average, support vector machines and extra-trees were the top performing classifiers, whereas the algorithms based on logistic regression were the best choice for feature selection. We found no advantage in using data cleaning or class balancing methods. Conclusion: We demonstrated that incorporation of organ- and dose-shape descriptors is beneficial for xerostomia prediction in highly conformal radiotherapy treatments. Due to strong reliance on patient-specific, dose-independent factors, our results underscore the need for development of personalized data-driven risk profiles for NTCP models of xerostomia. The facilitated machine learning pipeline is described in detail and can serve as a valuable reference for future work in radiomic and dosiomic NTCP modeling.","Gabrys, HS; Buettner, F; Sterzing, F; Hauswald, H; Bangert, M",10.3389/fonc.2018.00035,journalArticle,LIX7Z94X,2018,,1

Sentiment analysis of sindhi tweets dataset using supervised machine learning techniques,NO,,,,"Social websites are major opinion sharing platform now a days with millions of people using them each day. Twitter is one of the top social media platforms on internet. With the introduction of multiple languages over social media, individuals are usually sharing their opinion in their native language. Individual and organizations are interested in people's opinion on internet for their future strategies for business and products. In this paper, we have performed sentiment analysis of Sindhi language using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset we developed is tweets in Sindhi language. Automated approach using predefined lexicon is used to give positive and negative polarity to tweets so we have two classes. Pre-processing involves removal of non-Sindhi words, extra white spaces, removal of punctuations, after that tokenization of text is performed. After data cleaning and labelling, supervised machine learning techniques were applied on the Sindhi tweets dataset. We applied Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and K-nearest neighbour. Results showed that Decision Tree and K-nearest neighbour gave the best accuracy on Sindhi tweets dataset followed by SVM.  2019 IEEE.","Hammad, Muhammad; Anwar, Haris",10.1109/INMIC48123.2019.9022770,conferencePaper,VB8K3Y83,2019,,1
Automated Annotations for AI Data and Model Transparency,NO,,,,"The data and Artificial Intelligence revolution has had a massive impact on enterprises, governments, and society alike. It is fueled by two key factors. First, data have become increasingly abundant and are often available openly. Enterprises have more data than they can process. Governments are spearheading open data initiatives by setting up data portals such as data.gov and releasing large amounts of data to the public. Second, AI engineering development is becoming increasingly democratized. Open source frameworks have enabled even an individual developer to engineer sophisticated AI systems. But with such ease of use comes the potential for irresponsible use of data.Ensuring that AI systems adhere to a set of ethical principles is one of the major problems of our age. We believe that data and model transparency has a key role to play in mitigating the deleterious effects of AI systems. In this article, we describe a framework to synthesize ideas from various domains such as data transparency, data quality, data governance among others to tackle this problem. Specifically, we advocate an approach based on automated annotations (of both data and the AI model), which has a number of appealing properties. The annotations could be used by enterprises to get visibility of potential issues, prepare data transparency reports, create and ensure policy compliance, and evaluate the readiness of data for diverse downstream AI applications. We propose a model architecture and enumerate its key components that could achieve these requirements. Finally, we describe a number of interesting challenges and opportunities.  2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Thirumuruganathan, Saravanan; Kunjir, Mayuresh; Ouzzani, Mourad; Chawla, Sanjay",10.1145/3460000,journalArticle,T74RD868,2022,,1
Faulty data detection and classification for bridge structural health monitoring via statistical and deep-learning approach,NO,,,,"Over the last several decades, a lot of bridges have been equipped with the bridge structural health monitoring system, leading to an accumulation of voluminous monitoring data. Since the sensors and associated transmission hardware are subjected to harsh environments, the monitoring data frequently contains various faults, and it is laborious to cleanse the data manually. For the purpose of automatically detecting and classifying faulty monitoring data in large quantities, this paper proposes a novel method that uses the relative frequency distribution histograms (RFDH) of monitoring data as well as the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN). The overall procedure of this method can be described as follows: First, RFDHs are constructed from different classes of hour-long data segments. Second, inverted envelopes of the RFDHs are labeled as the training data to train the 1-D CNN. Third, a well-trained 1-D CNN is used to detect and classify long-term monitoring data according to their RFDHs of hour-long data segments. Comprehensive validation of the proposed method is conducted with selective acceleration data collected from two long-span bridges. The validation yields satisfactory results, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and generality of the method.  2021 John Wiley  Sons, Ltd.",Xudong Jian; Huaqiang Zhong; Ye Xia; Limin Sun,10.1002/stc.2824,journalArticle,CWD6I7MA,2021,,1
Label denoising based on Bayesian aggregation,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,label,"Label noise is a common problem that affects supervised learning and can produce misleading results. It is shown that only 5% of switched labels lead to a decrease of performances. Therefore, the true class of an instance must be distinguished from its observed label. In the past decade, classification in presence of label noise was the topic of interest. Several scholars focused on kNN-based approaches for data cleansing. These types of approaches often are susceptible to high label noise rate and when a batch of instances with noisy labels are exist they may deteriorate the results. The problem arises since the methods have a local view of instances. Another approach is to have a global view of instances. In a global view, instances with large distance from their respective classes are detected as noisy. A potential problem however is the determination of a threshold. An inappropriate threshold may lead to detection of a correct instance as noisy instance. In this paper a new method for label denoising based on Bayesian aggregation is proposed which solves the problems of kNN-based approaches by aggregating the local and global views of instances. The aggregation of local and global information leads to a more robust and accurate detection of instances with noisy labels and estimation of their true labels. The experimental results show the capabilities and robustness of the proposed method.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bagherzadeh, Parsa; Sadoghi Yazdi, Hadi",10.1007/s13042-015-0474-y,journalArticle,IRWZDJP4,2017,aug,1
ImageDC: Image Data Cleaning Framework Based on Deep Learning,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,features,"Although user-generated image data increases more and more quickly on the current Internet, many image methods have attracted widespread attention from industry and academia. Recently, some image classification approaches using deep learning have demonstrated that they can potentially enhance the accuracy of the classification based on the high quality datasets. However, the existing methods only consider the accuracy of the classification and ignore the quality of the datasets. To address these issues, we propose a new image data cleaning framework using deep neural networks, named ImageDC, to improve the quality of the datasets. ImageDC not only uses cleaning with the minority class to remove the images of the rarely classes, but also adopts cleaning with the low recognition rate to remove the noisy data to enhance the recognition rate of the datasets. Experimental results conducted on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the whole approaches.  2020 IEEE.","Zhang, Yun; Jin, Zongze; Liu, Fan; Zhu, Weilin; Mu, Weimin; Wang, Weiping",10.1109/ICAIIS49377.2020.9194803,conferencePaper,SAR6KHYL,2020,,1
Automatic classification of ICA components from infant EEG using MARA,NO,,,,"Automated systems for identifying and removing non-neural ICA components are growing in popularity among EEG researchers of adult populations. Infant EEG data differs in many ways from adult EEG data, but there exists almost no specific system for automated classification of source components from paediatric populations. Here, we adapt one of the most popular systems for adult ICA component classification for use with infant EEG data. Our adapted classifier significantly outperformed the original adult classifier on samples of naturalistic free play EEG data recorded from 10 to 12-month-old infants, achieving agreement rates with the manual classification of over 75% across two validation studies (n = 44, n = 25). Additionally, we examined both classifiers’ ability to remove stereotyped ocular artifact from a basic visual processing ERP dataset compared to manual ICA data cleaning. Here, the new classifier performed on level with expert manual cleaning and was again significantly better than the adult classifier at removing artifact whilst retaining a greater amount of genuine neural signal operationalised through comparing ERP activations in time and space. Our new system (iMARA) offers developmental EEG researchers a flexible tool for automatic identification and removal of artifactual ICA components.","Marriott Haresign, I.; Phillips, E.; Whitehorn, M.; Noreika, V.; Jones, E.J.H.; Leong, V.; Wass, S.V.",10.1016/j.dcn.2021.101024,journalArticle,SMZP7WMT,2021,,1

TabCellNet: Deep learning-based tabular cell structure detection,NO,,,,"There is an increasing demand for automated document processing techniques as the volume of electronic component documents increase. This is most prevalent in the supply chain optimization sector where vast amount of documents need to be processed and is time consuming and prone to error. Detection of tables and table structures serves as a crucial step to automate document processing. While table detection is a well investigated problem, tabular structure detection is more complex, and requires further improvements. To address this, this study proposes a deep learning model that focuses on high precision tabular cell structure detection. The proposed model creates a benchmark for the ICDAR2013 dataset cell structure with comparison to the previous state of the art table detection models as well as proposing alternative models. Our methodology approaches improving table structure detection through the detection of cells instead of row and columns for better generalization capabilities for heterogeneous table structures.

Automated generation of cerebral blood flow and arterial transit time maps from multiple delay arterial spin-labeled MRI,NO,,,,"Purpose: Develop and evaluate a deep learning approach to estimate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT) from multiple post-labeling delay (PLD) ASL MRI. Methods: ASL MRI were acquired with 6 PLDs on a 1.5T or 3T GE system in adults with and without cognitive impairment (N=99). Voxel-level CBF and ATT maps were quantified by training models with distinct convolutional neural network architectures: (1) convolutional neural network (CNN) and (2) U-Net. Models were trained and compared via 5-fold cross validation. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE). Model outputs were trained on and compared against a reference ASL model fitting after data cleaning. Minimally processed ASL data served as another benchmark. Model output uncertainty was estimated using Monte Carlo dropout. The better-performing neural network was subsequently re-trained on inputs with missing PLDs to investigate generalizability to different PLD schedules. Results: Relative to the CNN, the U-Net yielded lower MAE on training data. On test data, the U-Net MAE was 8.4  1.4mL/100 g/min for CBF and 0.22  0.09 s for ATT. A significant association was observed between MAE and Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimates. Neural network performance remained stable despite systematically reducing the number of input images (i.e., up to 3 missing PLD images). Mean processing time was 10.77 s for the U-Net neural network compared to 10min 41 s for the reference pipeline. Conclusion: It is feasible to generate CBF and ATT maps from 1.5T and 3T multi-PLD ASL MRI with a fast deep learning image-generation approach.  2022 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.","Luciw, Nicholas J.; Shirzadi, Zahra; Black, Sandra E.; Goubran, Maged; MacIntosh, Bradley J.",10.1002/mrm.29193,journalArticle,NA9BVYYS,2022,,1

Machine learning regression of stellar effective temperatures in the second Gaia data release,NO,,,,"This paper reports on the application of the supervised machine-learning algorithm to the stellar effective temperature regression for the second Gaia data release, based on the combination of the stars in four spectroscopic surveys: Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration, the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and the RAdial Velocity Extension. This combination, about four million stars, enables us to construct one of the largest training sample for the regression, and further predict reliable stellar temperatures with a root-mean-squared error of 191 K. This result is more precise than that given by Gaia second data release that is based on about sixty thousands stars. After a series of data cleaning processes, the input features that feed the regressor are carefully selected from the Gaia parameters, including the colors, the 3D position and the proper motion. These Gaia parameters is used to predict effective temperatures for 132,739,323 valid stars in the second Gaia data release. We also present a new method for blind tests and a test for external regression without additional data. The machine-learning algorithm fed with the parameters only in one catalog provides us an effective approach to maximize sample size for prediction, and this methodology has a wide application prospect in future studies of astrophysics.

Phases of learning dynamics in artificial neural networks in the absence or presence of mislabeled data,NO,,,,"Despite the tremendous success of deep neural networks in machine learning, the underlying reason for their superior learning capability remains unclear. Here, we present a framework based on statistical physics to study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which drives learning in neural networks. Using the minibatch gradient ensemble, we construct order parameters to characterize the dynamics of weight updates in SGD. In the case without mislabeled data, we find that the SGD learning dynamics transitions from a fast learning phase to a slow exploration phase, which is associated with large changes in the order parameters that characterize the alignment of SGD gradients and their mean amplitude. In a more complex case, with randomly mislabeled samples, the SGD learning dynamics falls into four distinct phases. First, the system finds solutions for the correctly labeled samples in phase I; it then wanders around these solutions in phase II until it finds a direction that enables it to learn the mislabeled samples during phase III, after which, it finds solutions that satisfy all training samples during phase IV. Correspondingly, the test error decreases during phase I and remains low during phase II; however, it increases during phase III and reaches a high plateau during phase IV. The transitions between different phases can be understood by examining changes in the order parameters that characterize the alignment of the mean gradients for the two datasets (correctly and incorrectly labeled samples) and their (relative) strengths during learning. We find that individual sample losses for the two datasets are separated the most during phase II, leading to a data cleansing process that eliminates mislabeled samples and improves generalization. Overall, we believe that an approach based on statistical physics and stochastic dynamic systems theory provides a promising framework for describing and understanding learning dynamics in neural networks, which may also lead to more efficient learning algorithms.  2021 The Author(s).","Feng, Yu; Tu, Yuhai",10.1088/2632-2153/abf5b9,journalArticle,9JCSG7IS,2021,,1

Scaling entity resolution: A loosely schema-aware approach,YES,ML4DC,?,el,"In big data sources, real-world entities are typically represented with a variety of schemata and formats (e.g., relational records, JSON objects, etc.). Different profiles (i.e., representations) of an entity often contain redundant and/or inconsistent information. Thus identifying which profiles refer to the same entity is a fundamental task (called Entity Resolution) to unleash the value of big data. The naïve all-pairs comparison solution is impractical on large data, hence blocking methods are employed to partition a profile collection into (possibly overlapping) blocks and limit the comparisons to profiles that appear in the same block together. Meta-blocking is the task of restructuring a block collection, removing superfluous comparisons. Existing meta-blocking approaches rely exclusively on schema-agnostic features, under the assumption that handling the schema variety of big data does not pay-off for such a task. In this paper, we demonstrate how “loose” schema information (i.e., statistics collected directly from the data) can be exploited to enhance the quality of the blocks in a holistic loosely schema-aware (meta-)blocking approach that can be used to speed up your favorite Entity Resolution algorithm. We call it Blast (Blocking with Loosely-Aware Schema Techniques). We show how Blast can automatically extract the loose schema information by adopting an LSH-based step for efficiently handling volume and schema heterogeneity of the data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel meta-blocking algorithm that can be employed to efficiently execute Blast on MapReduce-like systems (such as Apache Spark). Finally, we experimentally demonstrate, on real-world datasets, how Blast outperforms the state-of-the-art (meta-)blocking approaches.","Simonini, Giovanni; Gagliardelli, Luca; Bergamaschi, Sonia; Jagadish, H.V.",10.1016/j.is.2019.03.006,journalArticle,4B5EWRQW,2019,aug,1

Enhanced Diagnosis of Pneumothorax with an Improved Real-Time Augmentation for Imbalanced Chest X-rays Data Based on DCNN,NO,,,,"Pneumothorax is a common pulmonary disease that can lead to dyspnea and can be life-threatening. X-ray examination is the main means to diagnose this disease. Computer-aided diagnosis of pneumothorax on chest X-ray, as a prerequisite for a timely cure, has been widely studied, but it is still not satisfactory to achieve highly accurate results. In this paper, an image classification algorithm based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for high-resolution medical image analysis of pneumothorax X-rays, which features a Network In Network (NIN) for cleaning the data, random histogram equalization data augmentation processing, and a DCNN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively increase the correct diagnosis rate of pneumothorax, and the Area under Curve (AUC) of the test verified in the experiment is 0.9844 on ZJU-2 test data and 0.9906 on the ChestX-ray14, respectively. In addition, a large number of atmospheric pleura samples are visualized and analyzed based on the experimental results and in-depth learning characteristics of the algorithm. The analysis results verify the validity of feature extraction for the network. Combined with the results of these two aspects, the proposed X-ray image processing algorithm can effectively improve the classification accuracy of pneumothorax photographs.",Yaqi Wang; Lingling Sun; Qun Jin,10.1109/TCBB.2019.2911947,journalArticle,DQUCMWCZ,2021,,1
An Effective Data Sampling Procedure for Imbalanced Data Learning on Health Insurance Fraud Detection,NO,,,,"from many academic research and industries worldwide due to its increasing popularity. Insurance datasets are enormous, with skewed distributions and high dimensionality. Skewed class distribution and its volume are considered significant problems while analyzing insurance datasets, as these issues increase the misclassification rates. Although sampling approaches, such as random oversampling and SMOTE can help balance the data, they can also increase the computational complexity and lead to a deterioration of model's performance. So, more sophisticated techniques are needed to balance the skewed classes efficiently. This research focuses on optimizing the learner for fraud detection by applying a Fused Resampling and Cleaning Ensemble (FusedRCE) for effective sampling in health insurance fraud detection. We hypothesized that meticulous oversampling followed with a guided data cleaning would improve the prediction performance and learner's understanding of the minority fraudulent classes compared to other sampling techniques. The proposed model works in three steps. As a first step, PCA is applied to extract the necessary features and reduce the dimensions in the data. In the second step, a hybrid combination of k-means clustering and SMOTE oversampling is used to resample the imbalanced data. Oversampling introduces lots of noise in the data. A thorough cleaning is performed on the balanced data to remove the noisy samples generated during oversampling using the Tomek Link algorithm in the third step. Tomek Link algorithm clears the boundary between minority and majority class samples and makes the data more precise and freer from noise. The resultant dataset is used by four different classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks using repeated 5-fold cross-validation. Compared to other classifiers, Neural Networks with FusedRCE had the highest average prediction rate of 98.9%. The results were also measured using parameters such as F1 score, Precision, Recall and AUC values. The results obtained show that the proposed method performed significantly better than any other fraud detection approach in health insurance by predicting more fraudulent data with greater accuracy and a 3x increase in speed during training.  2020, Journal of Computing and Information Technology.

Sample Reduction for Physiological Data Analysis Using Principal Component Analysis in Artificial Neural Network,NO,,,,"With its potential, extensive data analysis is a vital part of biomedical applications and of medical practitioner interpretations, as data analysis ensures the integrity of multidimensional datasets and improves classification accuracy; however, with machine learning, the integrity of the sources is compromised when the acquired data pose a significant threat in diagnosing and analysing such information, such as by including noisy and biased samples in the multidimensional datasets. Removing noisy samples in dirty datasets is integral to and crucial in biomedical applications, such as the classification and prediction problems using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the body's physiological signal analysis. In this study, we developed a methodology to identify and remove noisy data from a dataset before addressing the classification problem of an artificial neural network (ANN) by proposing the use of the principal component analysis-sample reduction process (PCA-SRP) to improve its performance as a data-cleaning agent. We first discuss the theoretical background to this data-cleansing methodology in the classification problem of an artificial neural network (ANN). Then, we discuss how the PCA is used in data-cleansing techniques through a sample reduction process (SRP) using various publicly available biomedical datasets with different samples and feature sizes. Lastly, the cleaned datasets were tested through the following: PCA-SRP in ANN accuracy comparison testing, sensitivity vs. specificity testing, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve testing, and accuracy vs. additional random sample testing. The results show a significant improvement in the classification of ANNs using the developed methodology and suggested a recommended range of selectivity (Sc) factors for typical cleaning and ANN applications. Our approach successfully cleaned the noisy biomedical multidimensional datasets and yielded up to an 8% increase in accuracy with the aid of the Python language.","Adolfo, C.M.S.; Chizari, H.; Thu Yein Win; Al-Majeed, S.",10.3390/app11178240,journalArticle,ZWP4MQ4V,2021,,1

Data cleaning issues in class imbalanced datasets: instance selection and missing values imputation for one-class classifiers,not sure,,,,"Purpose Class imbalance learning, which exists in many domain problem datasets, is an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. One-class classification techniques, which aim to identify anomalies as the minority class from the normal data as the majority class, are one representative solution for class imbalanced datasets. Since one-class classifiers are trained using only normal data to create a decision boundary for later anomaly detection, the quality of the training set, i.e. the majority class, is one key factor that affects the performance of one-class classifiers. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, we focus on two data cleaning or preprocessing methods to address class imbalanced datasets. The first method examines whether performing instance selection to remove some noisy data from the majority class can improve the performance of one-class classifiers. The second method combines instance selection and missing value imputation, where the latter is used to handle incomplete datasets that contain missing values. Findings The experimental results are based on 44 class imbalanced datasets; three instance selection algorithms, including IB3, DROP3 and the GA, the CART decision tree for missing value imputation, and three one-class classifiers, which include OCSVM, IFOREST and LOF, show that if the instance selection algorithm is carefully chosen, performing this step could improve the quality of the training data, which makes one-class classifiers outperform the baselines without instance selection. Moreover, when class imbalanced datasets contain some missing values, combining missing value imputation and instance selection, regardless of which step is first performed, can maintain similar data quality as datasets without missing values. Originality/value The novelty of this paper is to investigate the effect of performing instance selection on the performance of one-class classifiers, which has never been done before. Moreover, this study is the first attempt to consider the scenario of missing values that exist in the training set for training one-class classifiers. In this case, performing missing value imputation and instance selection with different orders are compared.","Wang, ZY; Tsai, CF; Lin, WC",10.1108/DTA-01-2021-0027,journalArticle,D2EF2EJT,2021,,1

A Comprehensive Benchmark Framework for Active Learning Methods in Entity Matching,YES,ML4DC,tabular,el,"Entity Matching (EM) is a core data cleaning task, aiming to identify different mentions of the same real-world entity. Active learning is one way to address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection latencies by up to 10 without affecting the quality of the model.

"Revisiting conditional functional dependency discovery: Splitting the ""c"" from the ""fd""",YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Many techniques for cleaning dirty data are based on enforcing some set of integrity constraints. Conditional functional dependencies (CFDs) are a combination of traditional Functional dependencies (FDs) and association rules, and are widely used as a constraint formalism for data cleaning. However, the discovery of such CFDs has received limited attention. In this paper, we regard CFDs as an extension of association rules, and present three general methodologies for (approximate) CFD discovery, each using a different way of combining pattern mining for discovering the conditions (the ""C"" in CFD) with FD discovery. We discuss how existing algorithms fit into these three methodologies, and introduce new techniques to improve the discovery process. We show that the right choice of methodology improves performance over the traditional CFD discovery method CTane.

"An image-based deep learning model for cannabis diseases, nutrient deficiencies and pests identification",NO,,,,"In this work, a deep learning system for cannabis plants disease, nutrient deficiencies and pests identification is developed, based on image data processed by convolutional neural network models. Training of the models was performed using image data available on the Internet, while database development included data cleansing by expert agronomists, basic image editing, and data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning applications in order to expand the rather limited amount of available data. Three fungi diseases, two pests and three nutrient deficiencies were included in the identification system, together with healthy plants identification. The final model reached a performance of 90.79% in successfully identifying cannabis diseases (or healthy plants) in previously ""unseen"" plant images. The most difficult cannabis problems to be identified were powdery mildew and potassium deficiency. Results showed that transfer learning from existing models specialized in similar tasks to the one under development, is more successful than using transfer learning from more general models.

Statistical Modeling and Simulation of Online Shopping Customer Loyalty Based on Machine Learning and Big Data Analysis,NO,,,,"With the increase in the number of online shopping users, customer loyalty is directly related to product sales. This research mainly explores the statistical modeling and simulation of online shopping customer loyalty based on machine learning and big data analysis. This research mainly uses machine learning clustering algorithm to simulate customer loyalty. Call the k-means interactive mining algorithm based on the Hash structure to perform data mining on the multidimensional hierarchical tree of corporate credit risk, continuously adjust the support thresholds for different levels of data mining according to specific requirements and select effective association rules until satisfactory results are obtained. After conducting credit risk assessment and early warning modeling for the enterprise, the initial preselected model is obtained. The information to be collected is first obtained by the web crawler from the target website to the temporary web page database, where it will go through a series of preprocessing steps such as completion, deduplication, analysis, and extraction to ensure that the crawled web page is correctly analyzed, to avoid incorrect data due to network errors during the crawling process. The correctly parsed data will be stored for the next step of data cleaning or data analysis. For writing a Java program to parse HTML documents, first set the subject keyword and URL and parse the HTML from the obtained file or string by analyzing the structure of the website. Secondly, use the CSS selector to find the web page list information, retrieve the data, and store it in Elements. In the overall fit test of the model, the root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) value is 0.053, between 0.05 and 0.08.

A supervised learning approach for ICU mortality prediction based on unstructured electrocardiogram text reports,NO,,,,"Extracting patient data documented in text-based clinical records into a structured form is a predominantly manual process, both time and cost-intensive.

There is no good method for cleaning existing data sets containing false images that can simultaneously filter images with label noise and background noise. This paper presents a new method to solve the problem of image with label noise and background noise in weakly supervised learning, which can clean the wrong image with label noise and background noise. We first used the existing neural network VGG16_BN to extract the features of the image and delete the full connection layer. Then we added an error image automatic screening module to filter out the poor quality images and possible wrong images in priority. The images screened in this part include images with 40%-60% label noise and background noise. It can effectively reduce the screening range of the wrong image. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in the dataset of cat and dog dichoromy in the public dataset. We screened and determined that the dataset contained about 0.8% error images, and designed 200 error images to be screened by the proposed method. Finally, 186 designed error labels were screened out, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.  2021 IEEE.","Li, Zhengwen; Du, Wenju; Rao, Nini",10.1109/ICSIP52628.2021.9688888,conferencePaper,UZAU2LF9,2021,aug,1

MACER: A Modular Framework for Accelerated Compilation Error Repair,NO,,,,"Automated compilation error repair, the problem of suggesting fixes to buggy programs that fail to compile, has generated significant interest in recent years. Apart from being a tool of general convenience, automated code repair has significant pedagogical applications for novice programmers who find compiler error messages cryptic and unhelpful. Existing approaches largely solve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative learning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box application of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of training time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types. We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive discriminative learning techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair. Experiments indicate that the fine-grained approach adopted by MACER offers not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student. MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types  whether popular or rare. MACER offers a training time speedup of 2 over TRACER and 800 over RLAssist, and a test time speedup of 2  4 over both. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Identifying non-natural language artifacts in bug reports,NO,,,,"Bug reports are a popular target for natural language processing (NLP). However, bug reports often contain artifacts such as code snippets, log outputs and stack traces. These artifacts not only inflate the bug reports with noise, but often constitute a real problem for the NLP approach at hand and have to be removed. In this paper, we present a machine learning based approach to classify content into natural language and artifacts at line level implemented in Python. We show how data from GitHub issue trackers can be used for automated training set generation, and present a custom preprocessing approach for bug reports. Our model scores at 0.95 ROC-AUC and 0.93 F1 against our manually annotated validation set, and classifies 10k lines in 0.72 seconds. We cross evaluated our model against a foreign dataset and a foreign R model for the same task.

A framework for prediction of household energy consumption using feed forward back propagation neural network,NO,,,,"Energy is considered the most costly and scarce resource, and demand for it is increasing daily. Globally, a significant amount of energy is consumed in residential buildings, i.e., 30-40% of total energy consumption. An active energy prediction system is highly desirable for efficient energy production and utilization. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to predict short-term energy consumption in a residential building. The proposed methodology consisted of four different layers, namely data acquisition, preprocessing, prediction, and performance evaluation. For experimental analysis, real data collected from 4 multi-storied buildings situated in Seoul, South Korea, has been used. The collected data is provided as input to the data acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer afterwards, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes are applied to the input data for the removal of abnormalities. Preprocessing further consisted of two processes, namely the computation of statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) and data normalization. In the prediction layer, the feed forward back propagation neural network has been used on normalized data and data with statistical moments. In the performance evaluation layer, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) have been used to measure the performance of the proposed approach. The average values for data with statistical moments of MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are 4.3266, 11.9617, and 5.4625 respectively. These values of the statistical measures for data with statistical moments are less as compared to simple data and normalized data which indicates that the performance of the feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBPNN) on data with statistical moments is better when compared to simple data and normalized data.","Fayaz, M.; Shah, H.; Aseere, A.M.; Mashwani, W.K.; Shah, A.S.",10.3390/technologies7020030,journalArticle,NEKY57CU,2019,,1

Machine learning algorithms for forecasting and backcasting blood demand data with missing values and outliers: A study of Tema General Hospital of Ghana,Specific,,,,"The major challenge in managing blood products lies in the uncertainty of blood demand and supply, with a trade-off between shortage and wastage, especially in most developing countries. Thus, reliable demand predictions can be imperative in planning voluntary blood donation campaigns and improving blood availability within Ghana hospitals. However, most historical datasets on blood demand in Ghana are predominantly contaminated with missing values and outliers due to improper database management systems. Consequently, time-series prediction can be challenging since data cleaning can affect models’ predictive power. Also, machine learning (ML) models’ predictive power for backcasting past years’ lost data is understudied compared to their forecasting abilities. This study thus aims to compare K-Nearest Neighbour regression (KNN), Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Neural Network Auto-regressive (NNAR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models via a rolling-origin strategy, for forecasting and backcasting a blood demand data with missing values and outliers from a government hospital in Ghana. KNN performed well in forecasting blood demand (12.55% error); whereas, ELM achieved the highest backcasting power (19.36% error). Future studies can also employ ML algorithms as a good alternative for backcasting past values of time-series data that are time-reversible.","Twumasi, Clement; Twumasi, Juliet",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.10.008,journalArticle,JX6JLML3,2021,,1
Towards High-Energy Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries and Battery Analytics for Electric Aviation,NO,,,,"Since its commercialization in 1991, the rechargeable Li-ion battery has revolutionized how we live, work, and communicate. Further, rapidly declining costs have enabled the ongoing electrification of heavy industry, from automotive to power utilities and even aviation. Despite these important advances, reaching the targets required to minimize the effects of climate change requires improvements to battery technology across all levels of research and developmentfrom basic materials chemistry to optimizations in manufacturing and operations in the field. This work represents a cross-cutting effort that spans the breadth of this range. In the experimental portion, the fundamental electrochemistry of magnesium was studied in the context of developing new positive and negative electrode materials for magnesium batteries. In particular, we show how considering the system as two interfaces (cathode-electrolyte and anode-electrolyte) rather than three components (cathode, anode, and electrolyte) helps explain some of the nuances of magnesium compared to lithium electrochemistry. In the second part of this work, we address applied problems in the growing field of battery data science and analytics. We develop software tools and models for industry-relevant problems in basic battery data management, cell lifetime forecasting and validation, and specific applications in electric aviation. Magnesium batteries represent a compelling candidate for the next generation of battery chemistries. It offers the prospect of safer operation at lower costs to manufacture and ~60% greater energy density compared to Li-ion batteries. However, many problems at the anode-electrolyte and cathode-electrolyte interfaces need to be resolved. Many electrolytes passivate magnesium metal and are oxidized at the cathode, and the nature of the kinetics (both reaction and diffusion) is unclear. In the two main prongs of this section of this work we propose 1) a coating that provides kinetic stability to the anode, and 2) an electrochemical protocol for studying magnesium cathode materials with greater clarity and reliability. Together we believe these approaches may be married to each other to develop a robust, high-energy magnesium battery based on a magnesium metal anode and a metal oxide cathode. We also explore battery data science as it applies to the new electric aviation industry. There are three main contributions. First, we report a user-friendly software environment for battery data science. It is designed to streamline data management, data cleaning, and data analysis to help bridge the gap between the domain expertise of most battery scientists and the tools needed as the field becomes increasingly data intensive. Second, we use a neural network model to extend state-of-the-art cell cycle life predictions to include a wider range of datasets and testing conditions, such as C-rate, cell chemistry, and temperature. Third, we train an outlier detection algorithm to rapidly identify weak cell blocks in an electric aircraft battery pack. This is significant in that identifying weak cells helps determine the remaining useful life in a battery system, which is of utmost importance for flight operators. Each of these constitute pieces of an effort that is oriented toward developing standard operating procedures for battery safety, performance, and maintenance for electric aviation.

The 1st Data Science for Pavements Challenge,NO,,,,"The Data Science for Pavement Challenge (DSPC) seeks to accelerate the research and development of automated vision systems for pavement condition monitoring and evaluation by providing a platform with benchmarked datasets and codes for teams to innovate and develop machine learning algorithms that are practice-ready for use by industry. The first edition of the competition attracted 22 teams from 8 countries. Participants were required to automatically detect and classify different types of pavement distresses present in images captured from multiple sources, and under different conditions. The competition was data-centric: teams were tasked to increase the accuracy of a predefined model architecture by utilizing various data modification methods such as cleaning, labeling and augmentation. A real-time, online evaluation system was developed to rank teams based on the F1 score. Leaderboard results showed the promise and challenges of machine for advancing automation in pavement monitoring and evaluation. This paper summarizes the solutions from the top 5 teams. These teams proposed innovations in the areas of data cleaning, annotation, augmentation, and detection parameter tuning. The F1 score for the top-ranked team was approximately 0.9. The paper concludes with a review of different experiments that worked well for the current challenge and those that did not yield any significant improvement in model accuracy.  2022, CC BY-NC-SA.","Behzadian, Ashkan; Muturi, Tanner Wambui; Zhang, Tianjie; Kim, Hongmin; Mullins, Amanda; Lu, Yang; Owor, Neema Jasika; Adu-Gyamfi, Yaw; Buttlar, William; Hamed, Majidifard; Aboah, Armstrong; Mensching, David; Robert, Spragg; Corrigan, Matthew; Youtchef, Jack; Eshan, Dave",10.48550/arXiv.2206.04874,journalArticle,A23XYKXS,2022,,1

A Review: Application of Machine Learning Algorithm in Medical Diagnosis,NO,,,,"After Covid 19 Pandemic people are more focusing on healthcare.

Incorporating Knowledge Bases and Databases to an Effective Repair of Data Errors,NO,,,,"In data warehousing and integration, data error repairs are very important. Some existing techniques tend to fix data errors using machine learning, statistics, integrity constraints, while others use multiple iterations to find data errors and a long time to repair them. Researches have shown the data cleaning accuracy is not efficient using those techniques. Thus to improve the accuracy, some works provided mechanisms employing knowledge bases (kbs) and crowdsourcing platforms, but using only single tables to achieve that. In this work a data error repair mechanism is proposed, which involves the use of a knowledge base on an entire database system having common attributes among its tables. Thorough experiments showed the effectiveness of the mechanism, with results showing the proposed technique is more efficient and effective using the whole database as compared to data repairs done on single tables.  2021 ACM.","Haruna, Charles Roland; Yang, Jian; Hou, Meng Shu; Gou, Lei; Fan, Shu Huan; Eghan-Yartel, Barbie",10.1145/3456529.3456536,conferencePaper,J8KC4IP3,2021,,1
Solar Irradiance Capturing in Cloudy Sky Days-A Convolutional Neural Network Based Image Regression Approach,NO,,,,"Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is a critical index to indicate the output power of the photovaltaic (PV). In traditional approaches, the local GHI can be measured with very expensive instruments, and the large-area GHI collection depends on complex satellite-based models, solargis algorithms, and the high-performance computers (HPC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to capture the GHI conveniently and accurately. Considering the nonstationary property of the GHI on cloudy days, the GHI capturing is cast as an image regression problem. In traditional approaches, the image regression problem is treated as two parts, feature extraction (for the images) and regression model (for the regression targets), which are optimized separately and blocked the interconnections. Considering the nonlinear regression capability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based image regression approach is proposed to provide an End-to-End solution for the cloudy day GHI capturing problem in this paper. The multilayer CNN is based on the AlexNet and VGG. The L2 (least square errors) with regularization is used as the loss function in the regression layer. For data cleaning, the Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference is employed to detect and eliminate the anomaly data in a nonparametric manner. The purified data are used as input data for the proposed image regression approach. In the experiments, three-month sky images and GHI data (with 1-min resolution) are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the HPC system. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.  2013 IEEE.","Jiang, Huaiguang; Gu, Yi; Xie, Yu; Yang, Rui; Zhang, Yingchen",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2969549,journalArticle,ZPSV2CMX,2020,,1

cleanTS: Automated (AutoML) tool to clean univariate time series at microscales,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,features,"Data cleaning is one of the most important tasks in data analysis processes. One of the perennial challenges in data analytics is the detection and handling of non-valid data. Failing to do so can result in creating imbalanced observations that can cause bias and influence estimates, and in extreme cases, can even lead to inaccurate analytics and unreliable decisions. Usually, the process of data cleaning is time-consuming due to its growing volume, velocity, and variety. Further, the complexity and difficulty of the cleaning process increase with the amount of data to be analyzed. It is rarely the case that any real-world data is clean and error-free. Thus, pre-processing the data before using it for analysis has become standard practice. This paper is intended to provide an easy-to-use and reliable system which automates the cleaning process for univariate time series data. Also, automating the process reduces the time required for cleaning it. Another issue that the proposed system aims to solve is making the visualization of a large amount of data more effective. To tackle these issues, an R package, cleanTS is proposed. The proposed system provides a way to analyze data on different scales and resolutions. Also, it provides users with tools and a benchmark system for comparing various techniques used in data cleaning.  2022 The Author(s)","Shende, Mayur Kishor; Feijoo-Lorenzo, Andres E.; Bokde, Neeraj Dhanraj",10.1016/j.neucom.2022.05.057,journalArticle,EEH2W5TZ,2022,aug,1

A simple and robust approach to energy disaggregation in the presence of outliers,NO,,,,"Energy disaggregation is to discover the energy consumption of individual appliances from their aggregated energy values. Most existing approaches rely on either appliances’ signatures or their state transition patterns, both hard to obtain in practice. In addition, load data may be corrupted due to various reasons. To overcome the problems, this paper utilizes easily accessible knowledge of appliances and the sparsity of the switching events to design a Sparse Switching Event Recovering (SSER) method. Furthermore, a robust version of this method (RSSER) is developed to tackle the problems caused by corrupted data and unknown appliances. By minimizing the total variation of the sparse event matrix and introducing a virtual appliance, RSSER can obtain accurate energy disaggregation results in the presence of outliers, without using any explicit data cleansing method. To speed up RSSER, a Parallel Local Optimization Algorithm (PLOA) is proposed to solve the problem in active epochs of appliance activities in parallel. To automatically acquire the power consumption knowledge of appliances whose information is unknown, we develop a K-median clustering based power division approach and establish an appliance power configuration platform. Using real-world trace data from our energy monitoring platform, the performance of RSSER is compared with that of the state-of-the-art solutions, including the least square estimation methods and a machine learning method using iterative Hidden Markov Model. The results show that RSSER not only has an overall better performance in both detection accuracy and overhead, but also can tolerate the interference of corrupted data and unknown appliances.","Tang, Guoming; Wu, Kui; Lei, Jingsheng; Tang, Jiuyang",10.1016/j.suscom.2016.01.004,journalArticle,K5LPDUR6,2016,,1

Combining predictive base models using deep ensemble learning,NO,,,,"Since information science and communication technologies had improved significantly, data volumes had expanded. As a result of that situation, advanced pre-processing and analysis of collected data became a crucial topic for extracting meaningful patterns hidden in the data. Therefore, traditional machine learning algorithms generally fail to gather satisfactory results when analyzing complex data. The main reason of this situation is the difficulty of capturing multiple characteristics of the high dimensional data. Within this scope, ensemble learning enables the integration of diversified single models to produce weak predictive results. The final combination is generally achieved by various voting schemes. On the other hand, if a large amount of single models are utilized, voting mechanism cannot be able to combine these results. At this point, Deep Learning (DL) provides the combination of the ensemble results in a considerable time. Apart from previous studies, we determine various predictive models in order to forecast the outcome of two different case studies. Consequently, data cleaning and feature selection are conducted in advance and three predictive models are defined to be combined. DL based integration is applied substituted for voting mechanism. The weak predictive results are fused based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) using different parameters and datasets and best predictors are extracted. After that, different experimental combinations are evaluated for gathering better prediction results. For comparison, grouped individual results (clusters) with proper parameters are compared with DL based ensemble results.  2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Residential High-Power Load Prediction Based on Optimized LSTM Network,NO,,,,"Residential load forecasting is an important standard to evaluate the potential of power demand response regulation, and high-power loads such as air conditioning and electric water heater are the largest components of household power load.

In this paper, we propose a model for short-term high power load forecasting based on a properly improved long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. At first, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to optimize the parameters of deep learning network, and improve the learning ability and efficiency of the model, further enhance the robustness and accuracy of the prediction model. Next, we use data cleaning to preprocess the UMass Smart dataset. Then, the processed data is used to train and forecast residential load in SSA-LSTM model.

Development of Big Data Analytics Platform for Electric Vehicle Battery Management System,NO,,,,"Electric Vehicle (EV) Batteries must have high reliability to produce durable and sustainable electrical energy. Reliable electric batteries will certainly have high economic value and efficiency. Reliability can be obtained if the system and its supporting are monitored using an integrated and independent system for further analysis and observation. Battery Management System (BMS) is integrated parts of Electric Vehicle, Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), or solar applications e.g. solar power plant. Its functions are to integrate many things such as voltage sampling from cell battery, cells balancing, determine State of Charge (SOC), estimate State of Health (SOH), and predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The key technology needed for condition-based maintenance is Prognostic and Health Management. It is a new engineering approach that allows an assessment of the system's health when the system is operating. It combines various scientific disciplines, namely: sensing technology, modern statistics, machine learning, physics of failure, and reliability engineering. It will be combined with Big Data analysis. Big data uses existing technology and contemporary architecture that is designed to efficiently take advantage of the many and varied data. Big data analytics refers to the method of analyzing huge volumes of data, high velocity of data, variety different forms of data, and veracity of uncertainty of data. The main focus in this research is the development of an integrated observation system and the ability to make error predictions. This system consists of error detection, error diagnosis, and integrated prognosis. This research is to implement Big Data analytics Platform to evaluate the reliability level of electric vehicle Battery Management System.","Karmawijaya, M.I.; Haq, I.N.; Leksono, E.; Widyotriatmo, A.",10.1109/ICEVT48285.2019.8994013,conferencePaper,HMX2CRE7,2019,,1
Short-term wind power prediction based on multidimensional data cleaning and feature reconfiguration,NO,,,,"Wind power prediction decreases the uncertainty of the entire energy system, which is essential for balancing energy supply and demand. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a short-term wind power prediction method based on data cleaning and feature reconfiguration is proposed. A large number of historical samples consisting of wind direction, wind speed, and wind power are mapped into a multidimensional sample space, and the distribution of wind data in different dimensions are analyzed in depth. By calculating the local density of each sample, outliers are effectively detected. The features of wind are reconfigured into a global information map combined with the time series information, which reflects the variation of the wind process in the short term. The features of the original data are greatly enriched, providing a high-quality training set for the prediction model. A redesigned convolutional neural network was used to predict short-term wind power, and the proposed methods were trained and tested based on a dataset of a real wind farm in China. Data cleaning and feature reconfiguration reduce the average single-point error by 1.38% and 2.56%, respectively, while the combined method reduced it by 6.24%. Plenty of experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve good performance and effectively improve the accuracy of short-term wind power prediction.  2021","Wang, Shuai; Li, Bin; Li, Guanzheng; Yao, Bin; Wu, Jianzhong",10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116851,journalArticle,EZFLAUX7,2021,,1
Sherlock: A deep learning approach to semantic data type detection,NO,,,,"Correctly detecting the semantic type of data columns is crucial for data science tasks such as automated data cleaning, schema matching, and data discovery. Existing data preparation and analysis systems rely on dictionary lookups and regular expression matching to detect semantic types. However, these matching-based approaches often are not robust to dirty data and only detect a limited number of types.We introduce Sherlock, a multi-input deep neural network for detecting semantic types. We train Sherlock on 686, 765 data columns retrieved from the VizNet corpus by matching 78 semantic types from DBpedia to column headers. We characterize each matched column with 1, 588 features describing the statistical properties, character distributions, word embeddings, and paragraph vectors of column values. Sherlock achieves a support-weighted F1 score of 0.89, exceeding that of machine learning baselines, dictionary and regular expression benchmarks, and the consensus of crowdsourced annotations.

Nutrient facts analysis using supervised learning approaches,NO,,,,"A healthy lifestyle in people is achieved by having balanced and nutritional food. In today's world we do not know with absolute certainty what foods can be consumed and what cannot be consumed, that is, we do not know for sure what foods have good nutritional value and what foods do not. The nutritional facts label is printed on food products all over the world and they are represented using a similar structure. These nutritional facts give data about some of the major nutrients present in the food product such as carbohydrates, protein and so on. These nutrition fact labels are not easily understood by common people. People who are careful about their diet such as those who exercise and diet regularly, trainers, and nutritionists may understand these nutritional facts, but not the common people. To make this information accessible in an easier way by classifying these food products into five levels of healthiness ranging from very healthy to very dangerous is the aim of this project work.

VLMixer: Unpaired Vision-Language Pre-training via Cross-Modal CutMix,NO,,,,"Existing vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods primarily rely on paired image-text datasets, which are either annotated by enormous human labors, or crawled from the internet followed by elaborate data cleaning techniques. To reduce the dependency on well-aligned image-text pairs, it is promising to directly leverage the large-scale text-only and image-only corpora. This paper proposes a data augmentation method, namely cross-modal CutMix (CMC), for implicit cross-modal alignment learning in unpaired VLP. Specifically, CMC transforms natural sentences from the textual view into a multi-modal view, where visually-grounded words in a sentence are randomly replaced by diverse image patches with similar semantics. There are several appealing proprieties of the proposed CMC. First, it enhances the data diversity while keeping the semantic meaning intact for tackling problems where the aligned data are scarce; Second, by attaching cross-modal noise on uni-modal data, it guides models to learn token-level interactions across modalities for better denoising. Furthermore, we present a new unpaired VLP method, dubbed as VLMixer, that integrates CMC with contrastive learning to pull together the uni-modal and multi-modal views for better instance-level alignments among different modalities. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks show that VLMixer could surpass previous state-of-the-art unpaired VLP methods. Copyright  2022, The Authors.

Double robust principal component analysis,NO,,,,"Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) aiming to recover underlying clean data with low-rank structure from the corrupted data, is a powerful tool in machine learning and data mining. However, in many real-world applications where new data (i.e., out-of-samples) in the testing phase can be unseen in the training procedure, (1) RPCA which is a transductive method can be naturally incapable of handing out-of-samples, and (2) violently applying RPCA into this applications does not explicitly consider the relationships between reconstruction error and low-rank representation. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a Double Robust Principal Component Analysis to deal with the out-of-sample problems, which is termed as DRPCA. More specifically, we integrate a reconstruction error into the criterion function of RPCA. Our proposed model can then benefit from (1) the robustness of principal components to outliers and missing values, (2) the bridge between reconstruction error and low-rank representation, (3) low-rank clean data extraction from new datum by a linear transform. To this end, extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate its superiority, when comparing with the state-of-the-art models, in several clustering and low-rank recovery tasks.

SUBJECTIVE QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR IMAGES GENERATED BY COMPUTER GRAPHICS,NO,,,,"With the development of rendering techniques, computer graphics generated images (CGIs) have been widely used in practical application scenarios such as architecture design, video games, simulators, movies, etc. Different from natural scene images (NSIs), the distortions of CGIs are usually caused by poor rending settings and limited computation resources. What's more, some CGIs may also suffer from compression distortions in transmission systems like cloud gaming and stream media. However, limited work has been put forward to tackle the problem of computer graphics generated images' quality assessment (CG-IQA). Therefore, in this paper, we establish a large-scale subjective CG-IQA database to deal with the challenge of CG-IQA tasks. We collect 25,454 in-the-wild CGIs through previous databases and personal collection. After data cleaning, we carefully select 1,200 CGIs to conduct the subjective experiment. Several popular no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods are tested on our database. The experimental results show that the handcrafted-based methods achieve low correlation with subjective judgment and deep learning based methods obtain relatively better performance, which demonstrates that the current NR-IQA models are not suitable for CG-IQA tasks and more effective models are urgently needed.

A directional margin paradigm for noise suppression in face recognition,NO,,,,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved outstanding face recognition (FR) performance with increasing large-scale face datasets. With face dataset size grown, noisy data will inevitably increase, undoubtedly bringing difficulties to data cleaning. In this paper, the probability that the sample belongs to noise can be determined based on the cosine distance (cos) of normalized angle center and face feature vector in the margin-based loss functions. According to this finding, we propose a two-step learning method integrated into the loss function. The new proposed directional margin loss function combines the noise probability with the label as the supervision information. Experiments show that our method can tolerate noisy data and get high FR accuracy when the training datasets mix with more than 30% noise. Our approach can also achieve a great result of 79.33% in MegaFace challenge one using a noisy training dataset.  2021 Elsevier Inc.","Zhou, Yang; Gong, Xun; Yang, Peng",10.1016/j.jvcir.2021.103182,journalArticle,KJ8GF8KF,2021,,1

Research on state prediction method of tobacco curing process based on model fusion,NO,,,,"China's tobacco plantation industry includes a large scale and numerous employees. Nevertheless, the current tobacco curing control technology has higher labor intensity, however, it also cannot be adjusted based on the conditions of different tobacco leaves batches reducing the quality of tobacco. The tobacco's quality can be improved after curing and labor intensity can be reduced by modeling the state prediction of the tobacco curing process, accurately predicting the state of the tobacco curing, and making timely adjustments to the curing process. The area, color, weight, and some chemical substances of tobacco leaves significantly change during the tobacco curing process. This can be theoretically used as the input feature of the state prediction model. However, it is difficult to calculate the changes of the area and the changes of chemical substances in real-time owing to the complexity of the intensive curing room environment. Only features such as color and weight are easier to extract indicating that the model has fewer available features, and the accuracy of prediction using a single model is relatively low. Considering this problem, a state prediction fusion model (SPFM) was proposed integrating Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). At the same time, based on the characteristics of the data set, a new data processing is proposed for the tobacco curing data set. By denoising, the image, the characteristic values of the RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space were extracted. Then, the data pre-processing such as standardization, data cleaning, and label digitization were performed on the data. Furthermore, an intelligent tobacco curing platform was designed to integrate data collection, online monitoring, data mining, and status prediction, and SPFM was embedded in the platform. A comparative test was conducted, based on the real data collected via a tobacco station in 2019. The results indicate that SPFM has a better performance compared to support vector machines, artificial neural network, and the base models of SPFM such as XGBoost and LSTM. The accuracy of SPFM is 0.974, with an increase of 4.8-59.7%; the macro recall of SPFM is 0.952, with an increase of 8.2%-49.9%; the macro recall of SPFM is 0.936, with an increase of 8.2-75.0%; and the macro F1-score of SPFM is 0.943, with an increase of 9.7-108.6%.","Wang, YC; Qin, L",10.1007/s12652-021-03129-5,journalArticle,DUVYV23S,0,,1
Evaluating the outcomes of medical informatics development as a discipline in China: A publication perspective,NO,,,,"Background As the world's second largest economy, China makes unique contributions to the world in many fields, including sociology, the economy, technology and defense. Medical informatics (MI) is an important cross-disciplinary field that, along with its applications, has received massive funding from the Chinese government. However, the question of how to evaluate China's input and output in MI remains important and complex issue of great significance for China and the rest of the world. Objective This paper analyzed, for the first time, the quality and quantity of research by Chinese academics in MI based on their articles published in international specialty journals in recent years and examined MI research hotspots in China. Our purpose is to summarize the experiences and lessons learned by China and the rest of the world as they develop MI. Method We targeted 18 MI journals listed in the JCR 2016 report and searched for papers published by Chinese academics in these 18 journals in the WOS and PUBMED databases and on journal sites. We also performed data cleansing and categorized the obtained information. We used Excel, SPSS, Ucinet and NetDraw to conduct quantitative analyses on the research papers. Results A total of 1340 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this study. We observed a significant upward trend in the number of articles published over time, particularly after 2011. Lei Jianbo, Huang Zhengxing and Li Jin-song are active Chinese authors in the MI discipline who have written many high-quality publications. Meanwhile, universities remain the primary breeding grounds for scientific research: 93.36% of the articles came from universities. Zhejiang University published the most first-author articles, whereas Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University produced 17.76% of the total articles. According to the lists of authors, 24% of the papers were co-authored with foreign researchers. This rate of cooperation is increasing each year, from 5.88% to the current rate of 39.04%. An analysis of keywords showed that “EMR”, “SVM”, “Authentication”, “Telecare medical information system”, “EEG”, “ECG” and “RFID” were the most frequently searched terms in popular technological fields, including artificial intelligence and image processing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-frequency keywords and a broadening range of research fields, which has led to the emergence of several research hotspots, including MI systems, mobile health care, telecare, data mining and machine learning. Conclusions Through the quantitative analysis of publications, we discovered the emergence of three stages – infancy, slow growth and rapid growth – in China's MI research in recent years as academics make achievements in their research works. The global influence of Chinese academics is growing, and they are making increasingly conscious efforts to enter into research collaborations with foreign researchers. The findings of Chinese academics’ publications are gaining international recognition.","Deng, Huan; Wang, Jing; Liu, Xingyu; Liu, Bangtao; Lei, Jianbo",10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.07.001,journalArticle,HTPDI5R7,2018,,1

Temperature prediction using multivariate time series deep learning in the lining of an electric arc furnace for ferronickel production,NO,,,,"The analysis of data from sensors in structures subjected to extreme conditions such as the ones used in smelting processes is a great decision tool that allows knowing the behavior of the structure under different operational conditions. In this industry, the furnaces and the different ele-ments are fully instrumented, including sensors to measure variables such as temperature, pressure, level, flow, power, electrode positions, among others. From the point of view of engineering and data analytics, this quantity of data presents an opportunity to understand the operation of the system under normal conditions or to explore new ways of operation by using information from models provided by using deep learning approaches. Although some approaches have been developed with application to this industry, it is still an open research area. As a contribution, this paper presents an applied deep learning temperature prediction model for a 75 MW electric arc furnace, which is used for ferronickel production. In general, the methodology proposed considers two steps: first, a data cleaning process to increase the quality of the data, eliminating both redundant information as well as atypical and unusual data, and second, a multivariate time series deep learning model to predict the temperatures in the furnace lining. The developed deep learning model is a sequential one based on GRU (gated recurrent unit) layer plus a dense layer. The GRU + Dense model achieved an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 C in the test set of 16 different thermocouples radially distributed on the furnace.  2021 by the authors.

Analysis of the Message Queueing Telemetry Transport Protocol for Data Labelling: An Orthopedic Manufacturing Process Case Study,NO,,,,"The recent paradigm shift in the industrial production systems, known as Industry 4.0, changes the work culture in terms of human machine interaction. Human labours are assisted by smart devices and machines as in human-machine cooperation and human-machine collaboration. For enhancing this process, data processing and analyses are needed. Therefore, data collection has become one of the most essential functions of large organizations. In this work, a data engineering experiment for a grinding process within a commercial orthotics manufacturing company is presented. The data collection and labelling is assessed for time stamp latency using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. This step is necessary to determine if alarm prediction or 'front running' is feasible. The paper analyses the procured dataset and discusses its merits as an alarm predictor, using sparsity indicators and concludes that a new investment in sensor infrastructure is necessary. This work highlights some of the limits of performance that exist for the use of MQTT with existing sensor infrastructure when retrofitting machine learning based alarm prediction in an industrial use case setting.

Batchwise probabilistic incremental data cleaning,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",?,features,"Lack of data and data quality issues are among the main bottlenecks that prevent further artificial intelligence adoption within many organizations, pushing data scientists to spend most of their time cleaning data before being able to answer analytical questions.

In this paper, we design a learning-based exact set similarity search approach, LES3. Our approach first partitions sets into groups, and then utilizes a light-weight bitmap-like indexing structure, called token-group matrix (TGM), to organize groups and prune out candidates given a query set. In order to optimize pruning using the TGM, we analytically investigate the optimal partitioning strategy under certain distributional assumptions. Using these results,we then design a learning-based partitioning approach called L2P and an associated data representation encoding, PTR, to identify the partitions. We conduct extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets to fully study LES3, establishing the effectiveness and superiority over other applicable approaches. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

A Framework for an Automated Development Environment to Support the Data-driven Machine Learning Paradigm,NO,,,,"In recent years a machine learning paradigm has emerged, focusing on a data-driven approach as opposed to traditional development. Advances in machine learning techniques have allowed researchers to make substantial gains in tackling complex problems in diverse fields such as medical diagnosis through image analysis, object detection and tracking, and natural language processing. However, often researchers only employ one or two machine learning algorithms with a static feature set while only testing a single hypothesis. This self-imposed bottleneck often produces suboptimal results because it arises from using machine learning within the classical, algorithmic context using existing development tools. Therefore, there is a need to create new development tools which reflect this change to the machine learning paradigm. In this research, we propose a development environment that allows researchers to leverage those capabilities more fully by shifting not only the tool they use but also their mindset. Our proposed environment serves as an intermediate tool, guiding the researcher and making full adoption of the machine learning paradigm throughout the software development process easier. To accomplish this, our framework is defined by a three-layer structure designed for subject domain assessment, data manipulation and feature set exploration. Supported by parallelism, data cleaning and feature engineering, this research provides a conceptual basis for future creation of development environments for the machine learning paradigm. Future development of such a conceptual design would allow for additional intelligent tools to aid the user in designing solutions and support reusability at the design level.  2022 IEEE.","Bowman, Anthony D.; Prabhakar, Shyam P.; Jololian, Leon",10.1109/SoutheastCon48659.2022.9764094,conferencePaper,FJIDMDZX,2022,,1

Research on Intelligent Correction of Abnormal Data in Online Education System Based on Big Data Technology,Specific,,,,"In the traditional correction method of abnormal data in online education system, the unreasonable selection of training samples by RBF neural network leads to a large error in the correction of abnormal data. Therefore, GA algorithm is used to improve RBF neural network, and a new intelligent correction method of abnormal data in online education system based on big data technology is proposed. The classification model of abnormal data in online education system is constructed by decision tree classification algorithm. The pretreatment of abnormal data is completed based on big data technology. The specific pre-processing steps include: data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, data reduction, dimension reduction, numerical reduction, data discretization and concept layering. GA-RBF neural network is used to correct abnormal data of online education system. By comparing the performance of this method with the traditional intelligent correction method of abnormal data in online education system, it can be seen that the prediction and filling accuracy of this method is higher than that of the traditional method, and the performance is improved.  2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Tang, Yana; Zhao, Jing",10.1007/978-3-030-84386-1_38,conferencePaper,NTTSVWYB,2021,,1

SPADE: A Semi-supervised Probabilistic Approach for Detecting Errors in Tables,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Error detection is one of the most important steps in data cleaning and usually requires extensive human interaction to ensure quality. Existing supervised methods in error detection require a significant amount of training data while unsupervised methods rely on fixed inductive biases, which are usually hard to generalize, to solve the problem. In this paper, we present SPADE, a novel semi-supervised probabilistic approach for error detection. SPADE introduces a novel probabilistic active learning model, where the system suggests examples to be labeled based on the agreements between user labels and indicative signals, which are designed to capture potential errors. SPADE uses a two-phase data augmentation process to enrich a dataset before training a deep-learning classifier to detect unlabeled errors. In our evaluation, SPADE achieves an average F1-score of 0.91 over five datasets and yields a 10% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art systems.  2021 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

HINDIA: a deep-learning-based model for spell-checking of Hindi language,NO,,,,"The spelling error is a mistake occurred while typing the text document. The applications like search engines, information retrieval, emails, etc., require user typing. In such applications, good spell-checker is essential to rectify the misspelling. Spell-checkers for western languages like English are very powerful and can handle any type of spelling errors, whereas in the case of Indian languages like Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kannada, Assamese, etc., the available spell-checkers are very basic ones. These spell-checkers are developed using traditional methods like statistical methods and rule-based methods. This article presents a novel model HINDIA to handle the spelling errors of the Hindi language, one of the most spoken languages in India. It utilizes a deep-learning method for spelling error detection and correction. The proposed spell-checking model works in two phases. In the first phase model identifies the erroneous words in the input sample and in the second phase it replaces the wrong words with the most probable correct words. Model HINDIA is developed using the attention-based encoderdecoder bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) which uses long short-term memory cells. Several modifications in the BiRNN have been made and network is fine-tuned to process the spelling errors of Hindi language. It uses publicly available dataset monolingual corpus developed by IIT Mumbai for training and testing. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in two scenarios. In the first scenario where the testing dataset is generated using split function. HINDIA performs significantly well with precision 0.86, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.78 and accuracy 0.80. Further, in the second scenario, where a dataset is manually generated its performance is fairly good with precision 0.81, recall 0.72, f-measure 0.76 and accuracy 0.74. Model HINDIA gives better performance than the deep-learning-based Malayalam spell-checker and some other deep-learning-based correction models present in the literature.  2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Singh, Shashank; Singh, Shailendra",10.1007/s00521-020-05207-9,journalArticle,BB2CURGI,2021,,1

Block Deep Neural Network-Based Signal Detector for Generalized Spatial Modulation [arXiv],NO,,,,"Generalized Spatial Modulation (GSM) is being considered for high capacity and energy-efficient networks of the future. However, signal detection due to inter channel interference among the active antennas is a challenge in GSM systems and is the focus of this letter. Specifically, we explore the feasibility of using deep neural networks (DNN) for signal detection in GSM. In particular, we propose a block DNN (B-DNN) based architecture, where the active antennas and their transmitted constellation symbols are detected by smaller sub-DNNs. After N-ordinary DNN detection, the Euclidean distance-based soft constellation algorithm is implemented. The proposed B-DNN detector achieves a BER performance that is superior to traditional block zero-forcing (B-ZF) and block minimum mean-squared error (B-MMSE) detection schemes and similar to that of classical maximum likelihood (ML) detector. Further, the proposed method requires less computation time and is more accurate than alternative conventional numerical methods.

Predicting COVID-19 Based on Environmental Factors With Machine Learning,NO,,,,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 50 million people in more than 100 countries, resulting in a major global impact. Many studies on the potential roles of environmental factors in the transmission of the novel COVID-19 have been published. However, the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 remains controversial. Machine learning techniques have been used effectively in combating the COVID-19 epidemic. However, researches related to machine learning on weather conditions in spreading COVID-19 is generally lacking. Therefore, in this study, three machine learning models (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), ADtree Classifier and BayesNet) based on the confirmed cases and weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are developed. This study aims to identify the best classification model to classify COVID-19 by using significant weather features chosen by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection method. The DS4C COVID-19 data set is used to train and validate each machine learning model. Several data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature selection have been conducted on the raw dataset to ensure the quality of the training data. The performance of these machine learning algorithms is further rectified based on the selected features set by PCA. Each classifier is then optimized using different tuning parameters to achieve optimum values before comparing the output of the three classifiers against each other. The observational results have shown that the optimized CNN classifier with seven weather variables selected by PCA achieved the highest performance among all the techniques. The experimental results obtained show that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the confirmed cases as compared to the other variables. Thus, from this result, it is evident that temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are important features for predicting COVID-19 confirmed cases.","Abdulkareem, AB; Sani, NS; Sahran, S; Alyessari, ZAA; Adam, A; Abd Rahman, AH; Abdulkarem, AB",10.32604/iasc.2021.015413,journalArticle,KY54C43Q,2021,,1
Efficient Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting for Effective Energy Management,NO,,,,"Short-term electrical energy load forecasting is one of the most significant problems associated with energy management for smart grids, which aims to optimize the operational strategies of buildings. Electricity forecasting models are considered a key aspect of the provision of better electricity management and reductions in energy consumption. This motivates the researchers to develop efficient electricity load forecasting (ELF) models, based on historical nonlinear and high volatile data, which require appropriate forecasting strategies. Therefore, in this article, we present an innovative two-phase framework for short-term ELF. The first phase is dedicated to data cleansing, in which pre-processing strategies are applied to raw data. In the second phase, a deep residual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract the important features from the refined data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a deep CNN architecture for the extraction of spatial features from electricity data. The output of the residual CNN network is forwarded to a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to learn the temporal information of the electricity data. The proposed model is then evaluated using the Individual-Household-Electric-Power-Consumption (IHEPC) and PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland (PJM) datasets. The results reveal a significant reduction in the error rate over the IHEPC dataset in terms of Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) (15.65%), Mean-Square-Error (MSE) (8.77%), and Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) (14.85%) and over the PJM dataset our method reduced RMSE up to 3.4% as compared to baseline models i.e., linear regression, LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Furthermore, we performed several experiments with CNN, LSTM, and GRU models and evaluated it with additional Coefficient of Variation of the RMSE (CV-RMSE) metrics, which proves the effectiveness of our model for short-term load forecasting.  2022 Elsevier Ltd","Khan, Zulfiqar Ahmad; Ullah, Amin; Ul Haq, Ijaz; Hamdy, Mohamed; Maria Maurod, Gerardo; Muhammad, Khan; Hijji, Mohammad; Baik, Sung Wook",10.1016/j.seta.2022.102337,journalArticle,7R83PK58,2022,,1

Responsible AI Challenges in End-to-end Machine Learning [arXiv],NO,,,,"Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday lives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision - depth, breadth, and usability - to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.","Whang, S.E.; Ki Hyun Tae; Yuji Roh; Geon Heo",,journalArticle,TRXW8LWV,2021,,1

Household-Level Energy Forecasting in Smart Buildings Using a Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Model,NO,,,,"Forecasting of energy consumption in Smart Buildings (SB) and using the extracted information to plan and operate power generation are crucial elements of the Smart Grid (SG) energy management. Prediction of electrical loads and scheduling the generation resources to match the demand enable the utility to mitigate the energy generation cost. Different methodologies have been employed to predict energy consumption at different levels of distribution and transmission systems. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict energy consumption in smart buildings. The proposed framework consists of two stages, namely, data cleaning, and model building. The data cleaning phase applies pre-processing techniques to the raw data and adds additional features of lag values. In the model-building phase, the hybrid model is trained on the processed data. The hybrid deep learning (DL) model is based on the stacking of fully connected layers, and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) on bi-directional LSTMs. The proposed model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies of energy consumption on dependent features and to be effective in terms of computational complexity, training time, and forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark energy consumption datasets yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy when compared with widely used hybrid models such as Convolutional (Conv) Neural Network-LSTM, ConvLSTM, LSTM encoder-decoder model, stacking models, etc. A mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.00% for case study 1 and a MAPE of 3.71% for case study 2 is obtained for the proposed forecasting DL model in comparison with LSTM-based models that yielded 7.80% MAPE and 5.099% MAPE for two datasets respectively.

A modified initialization method to find an initial center for Fuzzy K-modes clustering,NO,,,,"Data mining is used to analyzing the data and extracts the information from large data sets. Clustering is a technique which is used to grouping the objects which is having similar characters. In existing system, K-Means clustering is used to cluster the numerical data but it does not cluster the categorical data. To overcome the limitation of using numeric data only in the clustering process, F Jiang proposed the initialization method for K-modes clustering in which the initial cluster centres were calculated using Ini_Distance and Ini_Entropy methods were used. To improve the performance further, a new modified model is proposed for Fuzzy K-modes clustering. In this model, a modified Initial_Distance and Initial_Entropy Initialization method are used. It ensures that K initial cluster centers are not selected from the same cluster and selected initial cluster centers are not outliers. Also, one of a data preprocessing methods-Data cleaning is used to increase the quality of clustering results and a new modified weight matching distance (WMD) is calculated by using distance between two objects at the time initialization.

PUResNet: prediction of protein-ligand binding sites using deep residual neural network,NO,,,,"Background Predicting protein-ligand binding sites is a fundamental step in understanding the functional characteristics of proteins, which plays a vital role in elucidating different biological functions and is a crucial step in drug discovery. A protein exhibits its true nature after binding to its interacting molecule known as a ligand that binds only in the favorable binding site of the protein structure. Different computational methods exploiting the features of proteins have been developed to identify the binding sites in the protein structure, but none seems to provide promising results, and therefore, further investigation is required. Results In this study, we present a deep learning model PUResNet and a novel data cleaning process based on structural similarity for predicting protein-ligand binding sites. From the whole scPDB (an annotated database of druggable binding sites extracted from the Protein DataBank) database, 5020 protein structures were selected to address this problem, which were used to train PUResNet. With this, we achieved better and justifiable performance than the existing methods while evaluating two independent sets using distance, volume and proportion metrics.","Kandel, J; Tayara, H; Chong, KT",10.1186/s13321-021-00547-7,journalArticle,BK9VEHFW,2021,,1
TDTD: Thyroid disease type diagnostics,NO,,,,"Recently; medical data mining has become one of the well-established research areas of machine learning and AI base techniques have been used to solve the complex classification problem of thyroid disease. Due to the existence of non-palpable nodules it is very hard to detect the structural changes of thyroid disease by assessing the thyroid functional changes. For instance at structural level “Euthyroid” is normal thyroid hormonal functional state but this would be involved in initial structural changes such as goiter, cold nodule, MNG (multiple nodule goiter) and cancer (Grave's Disease and so on). The ideal system should not only identify all the thyroid disease types but also recommend state of structural levels; otherwise it would be converted into serious disease, such like cancer. In-order to mitigate such problems, this paper proposes a framework TDTD (Thyroid Disease Types Diagnostics) that aims to assist the physicians during the diagnostic process of thyroid diseases in a very structured and transparent manner. Proposed system TDTD presents a novel method MDC (Medical data cleaning) for filling of missing values in medical datasets by building classifier based upon the Bayesian isotonic regression algorithm because missing values of medical data (i.e. blood tests) are different in nature and they could not be filled with normal procedures. In second phase two classifiers are trained to classify the functional and structural levels of thyroid disease at granular level using multi and binary SVM (support vector machine) algorithms, in final phase performance and evaluation is approximated using confusion matrix, precision and recall measures.",J.

"Global Ensemble Streamflow and Flood Modeling with Application of Large Data Analytics, Deep learning and GIS",NO,,,,"Flooding is one of the most dangerous natural disasters that repeatedly occur globally, and flooding frequently leads to major urban, financial, anthropogenic, and environmental impacts in the subjected area. Therefore, developing flood susceptibility maps to identify flood zones in the catchment is necessary for improved flood management and decision making. Streamflow and flood forecasting can provide important information for various applications including optimization of water resource allocations, water quality assessment, cost analysis, sustainable design of hydrological infrastructures, improvement in agriculture and irrigation practices. Compared to conventional or physically based hydrological modeling, which needs a large amount of historical data and parameters, the recent data-driven models which require limited amounts of data, have received growing attention among researchers due to their high predictive performance. This makes them more appropriate for hydrological forecasting in basin-scale and data-scarce regions. In this context, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of various data-driven modeling approaches in flood and streamflow forecasting. One of the significant desires in daily streamflow prediction in todayaEs world is recognizing possible indicators and improving their applicability for effective water management strategies. In this context, the authors proposed an ensemble data mining algorithm coupled with various machine learning methods to perform data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, and feature subset selection. To perform the task of data mining, three data cleaning approaches: Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Tensor Flow (TF) and Tensor Flow K-means clustering(TF-k-means clustering) have been used. For the feature selection, four different machine learning approaches including K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bootstrap aggregating, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machin (SVM) have been investigated. Out of twelve different combinations of data mining and machine learning, the best ensemble model was TF-k-means clustering coupled with RF, which outperformed the other methods with 96.52% classification accuracy.Thereafter, a modified Nonlinear Echo State Networks Multivariate Polynomial (NESN-MP) named in the current study as Robust Nonlinear Echo State Network (RNESN) was utilized for daily streamflow forecasting. The RNESN decreases the size of the reservoir (hidden layer which performs random weigh initialization), reduces the computational burden compared with NESN-MP, and increases the interactions between the internal states. The model is thus simple and user-friendly with better learning ability and more accurate forecasting performance. The method has been tested with data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center (NOAA) and Daymet Data Set from NASA through the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS). Each data set includes the daily records of the local observed hydrological and large-scale weather/climate variability parameters. The efficiency of the proposed method has been evaluated in three regions namely Berkshire County (MA), Tuolumne County (CA), and Wasco County (OR). These basins were designated based upon the wide range of climatic conditions across the US that they represent. The simulation results were compared with NESN-MP and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The results validate the superiority of the proposed modeling approach compared to NESN-MP and ANFIS. The proposed RNESN approaches outperform the other methods with an RMSE = 0.98.For flood forecasting, an Evidential Belief Function (EBF) model, both as an individual model and in combination with Logistic Regression (LR) methods, has been proposed to prepare the flood susceptibility map. In in this study, we proposed a new ensemble of models of Bootstrap aggregating as a Meta classifier based upon the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) functions including coarse, cosine, cubic and weighted as base classifiers to perform spatial prediction of the flood. We first selected 10 conditioning factors to spatial prediction of floods and then their prediction capability using the relief-F attribute evaluation (RFAE) method was assessed. Model validation was performed using two statistical error-indexes and the area under the curve (AUC). Results concluded that the Bootstrap aggregating -cubic KNN ensemble model outperformed the other ensemble models. Therefore, the Bootstrap aggregating -cubic KNN model can be used as a promising technique for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas. Furthermore, the AUC results indicated that the EBF, EBF from LR, EBF-LR (enter), and EBF-LR (stepwise) success rates were 94.61%, 67.94%, 86.45%, and 56.31%, respectively, and the prediction rates were 94.55%, 66.41%, 83.19%, and 52.98%. The results showed that the EBF model had the highest accuracy in predicting the flood susceptibility map, in which 14% of the total areas were located in high and very high susceptibility classes and 62% were located in low and very low susceptibility classes.

Data Screening Based on Correlation Energy Fluctuation Coefficient and Deep Learning for Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearings,NO,,,,"The accuracy of the intelligent diagnosis of rolling bearings depends on the quality of its vibration data and the accuracy of the state identification model constructed accordingly. Aiming at the problem of ""poor quality"" of data and ""difficult to select"" structural parameters of the identification model, a method is proposed to integrate data cleaning in order to select effective learning samples and optimize the selection of the structural parameters of the deep belief network (DBN) model. First, by calculating the relative energy fluctuation value of the finite number of intrinsic function components using the variational modal decomposition of the rolling bearing vibration data, the proportion of each component containing the fault component is characterized. Then, high-quality learning samples are obtained through screening and reconstruction to achieve the effective cleaning of vibration data. Second, the improved particle swarm algorithm (IPSO) is used to optimize the number of nodes in each hidden layer of the DBN model in order to obtain the optimal structural parameters of the intelligent diagnosis model. Finally, the high-quality learning samples obtained from data cleaning are used as input to construct an intelligent identification model for rolling bearing faults. The results showed that the proposed method not only screens out the intrinsic mode function components that contain the fault effective components in the rolling bearing vibration data, but also finds the optimal solution for the number of nodes in the DBN hidden layer, which improves bearing state identification accuracy by 3%.  2022 by the authors.

Pervasive label errors in test sets destabilize machine learning benchmarks,NO,,,,"We identify label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets, and subsequently study the potential for these label errors to affect benchmark results. Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of at least 3.3% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (51% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled, on average across the datasets). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy  our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 5%.

An electrical impedance tomography based two-electrode frequency-scan gesture recognition system,NO,,,,"In this paper we proposed a novel two-electrode frequency-scan electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system for gesture recognition, which not only reduces the measurement complexity and the number of electrodes, but also achieves a high accuracy in recognizing common gestures and pinch gestures. We developed a bespoke circuit with two medical electrodes to collect data from the back of the hand and presented a frequency-scan method to increase the diversity of impedance data. The data were processed using data cleaning and feature extraction methods. The processed data were then sent to machine learning classification models for training and realizing accurate gesture recognition. To verify the effectiveness of this system, we designed two groups of nine gestures in a hand-gesture recognition experiment. The results showed that the system can achieve a recognition accuracy of 98.3% with a group of four common gestures and an accuracy of 97.4% with a group of five pinch gestures. Additionally, two proof-of-concept interactive scenarios were implemented to demonstrate the general purpose of this system.  2021, CC BY.","Ma, Gang; Chen, Haofeng; Wang, Peng; Wang, Xiaojie",10.36227/techrxiv.16691386,journalArticle,N5FTGFCX,2021,,1
Big data intelligent platform and application analysis for oil and gas resource development,NO,,,,"With the rapid improvement of exploration and monitoring technologies, the oil and gas industry has accumulated a large amount of data in the fields of seismic exploration, logging, production, and development. How to transform the huge ""data resources"" into ""data assets"" and fully utilize data and tap their real value to better serve society is a main concern in the oil and gas industry today. Therefore, the oil industry needs to complete the industrial upgrading of ""Smart Oilfield"" through digital and intelligent transformation. In recent years, the rise of big data technology and artificial intelligence have allowed international oil companies and oil service giants to accelerate the construction of digital and intelligent oil fields. The overall framework of the big data intelligent platform of oil and gas resources should be based on data resources with big data platform computing power as the support and artificial intelligence algorithms as the core. To meet the production needs of the oil and gas industry, it is of great urgency to build an oil and gas data resource pool that integrates exploration, development, and production data. The data quality can be improved via data cleaning and fusion. Physical simulations, data mining, and other approaches should be combined to achieve the modularization of service functions. Additionally, the goals of intelligent monitoring, early warning, and display on multi-dimensional platforms such as PC, control screen, and mobile apps can also be achieved. The analysis of artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning in the context of the oil and gas industry shows that these methods have good application prospects. In the future, oil companies should work together with scientific research institutes to tap the huge potential of oil industry data, achieve cost reduction and efficiency increase, and build a new smart oil and gas industrial ecosystem to complete industrial upgrading.

Electronic Health Record Driven Prediction for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Early Pregnancy,NO,,,,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is conventionally confirmed with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, but it is still uncertain whether it can be predicted with secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) in early pregnancy. To this purpose, the cost-sensitive hybrid model (CSHM) and five conventional machine learning methods are used to construct the predictive models, capturing the future risks of GDM in the temporally aggregated EHRs. The experimental data sources from a nested case-control study cohort, containing 33,935 gestational women in West China Second Hospital. After data cleaning, 4,378 cases and 50 attributes are stored and collected for the data set. Through selecting the most feasible method, the cost parameter of CSHM is adapted to deal with imbalance of the dataset. In the experiment, 3940 samples are used for training and the rest 438 samples for testing. Although the accuracy of positive samples is barely acceptable (62.16%), the results suggest that the vast majority (98.4%) of those predicted positive instances are real positives. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply machine learning models with EHRs to predict GDM, which will facilitate personalized medicine in maternal health management in the future.","Qiu, H; Yu, HY; Wang, LY; Yao, Q; Wu, SN; Yin, C; Fu, B; Zhu, XJ; Zhang, YL; Xing, Y; Deng, J; Yang, H; Lei, SD",10.1038/s41598-017-16665-y,journalArticle,DLTIBW8T,2017,,1

Cost-efficiency disk failure prediction via threshold-moving,NO,,,,"Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) is a technology in hard disk drives to predict impending disk failures for data repair in advance. As the prediction accuracy of SMART is unsatisfactory, recently, machine learning techniques have been explored to improve the prediction accuracy. Those approaches treat disk failure prediction as a binary classification problem and take SMART attributes as features, and some of them achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, there is no uniform metric to measure the financial impact of these methods whose primary objective is to reduce disk failure recovery costs via disk failure prediction. In this article, from a financial impact perspective, we propose a simple, yet practical, metric Mean-Cost-To-Recovery (MCTR) for disk failure prediction in data centers. Specifically, by assigning different weights to mispredicted healthy disks and failed disks, we measure the entire misprediction costs, that is, MCTR. In addition, we argue that the commonly used threshold 0.5 for disk failure prediction is suboptimal because of the fact of data imbalance, that is, failed disks are much fewer than healthy ones. To find the optimal threshold which renders minimal MCTR, we wrap a cost-minimizing procedure around disk failure prediction and use a threshold-moving technique for searching. Moreover, to map sample-level prediction results to disk-level prediction results, a modified leaky-bucket algorithm is design to determine the disk health state by considering its multiple sample-level prediction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments using three real-world datasets. The experimental results show that compared with reactive data protection schemes, we can reduce MCTR by up to 86.9%, and compared with cost-blind failure predictions, we can reduce MCTR by up to 22.3%.","Jiang, TM; Huang, P; Zhou, K",10.1002/cpe.5669,journalArticle,JQME4878,2020,,1
Local Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Momentum-Based Variance Reduction,NO,,,,"Bilevel Optimization has witnessed notable progress recently with new emerging efficient algorithms and has been applied to many machine learning tasks such as data cleaning, few-shot learning, and neural architecture search. However, little attention has been paid to solve the bilevel problems under distributed setting. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm which solves machine learning tasks over distributed-located data. FL problems are challenging to solve due to the heterogeneity and communication bottleneck. However, it is unclear how these challenges will affect the convergence of Bilevel Optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study Federated Bilevel Optimization problems. Specifically, we first propose the FedBiO, a deterministic gradient-based algorithm and we show it requires O(2) number of iterations to reach an -stationary point. Then we propose FedBiOAcc to accelerate FedBiO with the momentum-based variance-reduction technique under the stochastic scenario. We show FedBiOAcc has complexity of O(1.5). Finally, we validate our proposed algorithms via the important Fair Federated Learning task. More specifically, we define a bilevel-based group fair FL objective. Our algorithms show superior performances compared to other baselines in numerical experiments.  2022, CC BY.","Li, Junyi; Huang, Feihu; Huang, Heng",10.48550/arXiv.2205.01608,journalArticle,MGZD496A,2022,,1

A hybrid ensemble machine learning model to predict success of Bollywood movies,NO,,,,"Bollywood is a multi-billion industry.

A wheat spike detection method in uav images based on improved yolov5,NO,,,,"Deep-learning-based object detection algorithms have significantly improved the performance of wheat spike detection. However, UAV images crowned with small-sized, highly dense, and overlapping spikes cause the accuracy to decrease for detection. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv5 (You Look Only Once)-based method to detect wheat spikes accurately in UAV images and solve spike error detection and miss detection caused by occlusion conditions. The proposed method introduces data cleaning and data augmentation to improve the generalization ability of the detection network. The network is rebuilt by adding a microscale detection layer, setting prior anchor boxes, and adapting the confidence loss function of the detection layer based on the IoU (Intersection over Union). These refinements improve the feature extraction for small-sized wheat spikes and lead to better detection accuracy. With the confidence weights, the detection boxes in multiresolution images are fused to increase the accuracy under occlusion conditions. The result shows that the proposed method is better than the existing object detection algorithms, such as Faster RCNN, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), RetinaNet, and standard YOLOv5. The average accuracy (AP) of wheat spike detection in UAV images is 94.1%, which is 10.8% higher than the standard YOLOv5. Thus, the proposed method is a practical way to handle the spike detection in complex field scenarios and provide technical references for field-level wheat phenotype monitoring.  2021 by the authors.

Research on User Classification Method of Electricity Market Based on K-means,NO,,,,"In any industry, categorizing users and managing them in a targeted manner has always been an effective method. However, with the development of the times, there are more and more users, and more and more data can be collected, which has caused a certain degree of difficulty in user classification. User classification has always been one of the key researches in all walks of life. As one of the classic algorithms in unsupervised learning, the K-means clustering method has a good clustering effect on unlabeled data. According to the characteristics of the electricity consumption data of electricity market users, this paper proposes a user classification model based on K-means clustering algorithms. Firstly, it selects the median and 3 criterion to complete the missing values and clean up the abnormal values of the original electricity consumption data. Then use principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and finally use the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster the processed data. Through clustering, the users are divided into different clusters, each cluster is equivalent to a user group, and at the same time extract, the typical users of this user group are the representatives of this user category. The model is verified through the analysis of calculation examples, and the experimental results show that the classification of power users based on the K-means clustering algorithm is very effective.  2021 IEEE.","Liu, Li; Li, Han; Yang, JiaXuan; Yuan, ZiLong",10.1109/MLBDBI54094.2021.00079,conferencePaper,29TPYJQT,2021,,1

A Question Answering and Quiz Generation Chatbot for Education,NO,,,,"In recent years, there have been a number of chatbots developed in the field of education. While many of them are designed to answer queries based on publicly available information such as in community answering platforms, or from a predefined knowledge base, there is no possibility of customizing the information to be queried. Moreover, there are no existing chatbots capable of generating self assessment quizzes based on any given document. This paper proposes a Question Answering and Quiz Generation Chatbot that allows a user to upload relevant documents and perform two main functions on them, namely answer extraction and question generation. The uploaded document is converted into a knowledge base through a number of data cleaning and preprocessing steps. The Question Answering module uses ranking functions and neural networks to extract the most appropriate answer from the knowledge base and the Quiz Generation module identifies key sentences and generates question-answer pairs, which can be used to generate a quiz for the user.",A.

Automatically Debugging AutoML Pipelines using Maro: ML Automated Remediation Oracle (Extended Version),related,,,,"Machine learning in practice often involves complex pipelines for data cleansing, feature engineering, preprocessing, and prediction. These pipelines are composed of operators, which have to be correctly connected and whose hyperparameters must be correctly configured. Unfortunately, it is quite common for certain combinations of datasets, operators, or hyperparameters to cause failures. Diagnosing and fixing those failures is tedious and error-prone and can seriously derail a data scientists workflow. This paper describes an approach for automatically debugging an ML pipeline, explaining the failures, and producing a remediation. We implemented our approach, which builds on a combination of AutoML and SMT, in a tool called Maro. Maro works seamlessly with the familiar data science ecosystem including Python, Jupyter notebooks, scikit-learn, and AutoML tools such as Hyperopt. We empirically evaluate our tool and find that for most cases, a single remediation automatically fixes errors, produces no additional faults, and does not significantly impact optimal accuracy nor time to convergence.

LR-BCA: Label ranking for bridge condition assessment,NO,,,,"Bridge condition assessment (BCA) plays an important role in modern bridge management. Existing assessment methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone. The use of machine learning for BCA can effectively solve the above problems. However, the large amount of label noise in the dataset severely affected the performance of the BCA model. In this paper, we present an effective label ranking approach for BCA (LR-BCA). Our proposed LR-BCA method considers the natural order relationship between bridge condition ratings. Moreover, a heuristic data cleaning (HDC) approach is proposed for cleaning bridge condition dataset. The HDC method firstly identifies all the label conflict examples, then iteratively filters out the noise. Experimental results on real-world dataset confirm the effectiveness of the HDC method and demonstrate that our proposed LR-BCA method achieves 99% Top-2 accuracy, which is highly competitive compared to baseline methods.  2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

TransTab: Learning Transferable Tabular Transformers Across Tables,NO,,,,"Tabular data (or tables) are the most widely used data format in machine learning (ML). However, ML models often assume the table structure keeps fixed in training and testing. Before ML modeling, heavy data cleaning is required to merge disparate tables with different columns. This preprocessing often incurs significant data waste (e.g., removing unmatched columns and samples). How to learn ML models from multiple tables with partially overlapping columns? How to incrementally update ML models as more columns become available over time? Can we leverage model pretraining on multiple distinct tables? How to train an ML model which can predict on an unseen table? To answer all those questions, we propose to relax fixed table structures by introducing a Transferable Tabular Transformer (TransTab) for tables. The goal of TransTab is to convert each sample (a row in the table) to a generalizable embedding vector, and then apply stacked transformers for feature encoding. One methodology insight is combining column description and table cells as the raw input to a gated transformer model. The other insight is to introduce supervised and self-supervised pretraining to improve model performance. We compare TransTab with multiple baseline methods on diverse benchmark datasets and five oncology clinical trial datasets. Overall, TransTab ranks 1.00, 1.00, 1.78 out of 12 methods in supervised learning, feature incremental learning, and transfer learning scenarios, respectively; and the proposed pretraining leads to 2.3% AUC lift on average over the supervised learning.  2022, CC BY.","Wang, Zifeng; Sun, Jimeng",10.48550/arXiv.2205.09328,journalArticle,VGEJNNCF,2022,,1
An Efficient Convolutional Neural Network for Acute Pain Recognition Using HRV Features,NO,,,,"The pain of any individual can be felt only through experience. Therefore, clinicians are using self-report measures to assess acute pain after surgery. Thus, there is a need to predict and monitor acute pain effectively without self-report measures. In this study, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from the ECG signal is used to objectively assess the acute pain. The BioVid Heat Pain Database is utilized to evaluate the acute pain recognition task. HRV features such as time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear features are extracted and are utilized for this study. These features might be impacted with outliers, therefore, applied normal distribution and removed the outlines using standard deviation. After the data cleaning process, the best pain associated features are selected using One-way ANOVA and Post Hoc test. Finally, the pain level classification is performed using the modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and compared its performance with other baseline systems such as ELM and SVM. It reveals that the proposed system outperforms the other baseline systems with 99.2% classification accuracy.","Subramaniam, S.D.; Dass, B.",10.1007/978-981-16-2123-9_9,conferencePaper,2A28TLQB,2022,,1

Detecting Anomaly and Replacement Prediction for Rainfall Open Data in Thailand,NO,,,,"The rainfall data set usually contains missing values due to easily broken sensors. In Thailand, many public agencies collect rainfall values, including National Hydro Informatics (HII), Thai Meteorological Department, etc., since the data are valuable in terms of rainfall prediction, which is important for an agricultural country like Thailand. The rainfall data is normally collected hourly, and because there are many sensor locations, it is hard to maintain these sensors. The sensor data can be lost transiently and/or may yield anomaly values. Since there is a lot of data flowing to the server every day, it is hard to inspect manually or even semi-manually. This project collaborates with HII to develop a system that automates the rainfall data quality improvement process. The machine learning algorithms are used as tools for data cleansing. The derived data can be exposed as an open data set for many developers to explore new innovations. We explore data set characteristics and adopt both statistical and machine learning methods. The results show that the approach used both statistical and machine learning resulting in higher accuracy than using only statistical or machine learning approaches. We also develop a web application to visualize rainfall data results after cleansing and be connected to the models for the automatic cleansing pipelines.  2021 IEEE.","Prakaisak, Intouch; Phaisangittisagul, Ekachai; Maleewong, Montri; Sarinnapakorn, Kanoksri; Chantrapornchai, Chantana",10.1109/JCSSE53117.2021.9493814,conferencePaper,R64HWJKH,2021,,1

Data Management for Machine Learning: A Survey,Secondary works,,,,"Machine learning(ML) has widespread applications and has revolutionized many industries, but suffers from several challenges. First, sufficient high-quality training data is inevitable for producing a well-performed model, but the data is always human expensive to acquire.Second, a large amount of training data and complicated model structures lead to the inefficiency of training and inference. Third, given an ML task, one always needs to train lots of models, which are hard to manage in real applications. Fortunately, database techniques can benefit ML by addressing the above three challenges. In this paper, we review existing studies from the following three aspects along with the pipeline highly related to ML. (1) Data preparation(Pre-ML): it focuses on preparing high-quality training data that can improve the performance of the ML model, where we review data discovery, data cleaning and data labeling. (2) Model training \ inference(In-ML): researchers in ML community focus on improving the model performance during training, while in this survey we mainly study how to accelerate the entire training process, also including feature selection and model selection.

Data cleaning framework for highway asphalt pavement inspection data based on artificial neural networks,Specific,,,,"The acquisition of high-quality asphalt pavement inspection data is a key factor for road maintenance and management throughout the pavements life cycle. This paper establishes a data cleaning framework that is based on data mining and deep learning to eliminate abnormal data points and interpolate missing points to improve the accuracy of the original road inspection dataset. The first process in the proposed framework is to analyse the influential factors that are used to evaluate data quality and calculate the abnormality of the data through the confidence interval used in Gaussian fitting. Then, a deep artificial neural network is established to learn the mapping between the inspection data and data abnormality. The abnormal points are removed according to their abnormality level. Next, a second deep artificial neural network predicts the missing point values. Finally, by defining the overall cleanliness index of the dataset as the optimisation target, the steps are repeated until the cleanliness threshold is met. In this study, the proposed framework was applied to rut depth data cleaning for a highway maintenance project in Jiangsu Province, China. The cleanliness of the rut depth data increased by 695.75% after one cleaning cycle. 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Han, Chengjia; Zhang, Weiguang; Ma, Tao",10.1080/10298436.2021.2001813,journalArticle,CGK6KHHQ,2021,,1
Hyperspectral sensing based analysis for determining milk adulteration,NO,,,,"This research work was designed to evaluate the suitability and applicability of hyperspectral radiometry technology for robustly detecting adulterants in diary milk. The most common milk adulterants are (a) soda, (b) urea, (c) water and (d) detergents. The main contribution of this paper is to build a mathematical model to enable quantifying the degree of common adulterants present in milk. Data was collected using a portable spectroradiometer (Eko MS-720) which measures the spectral irradiance in the range from visible to near-infrared irradiance (350 nm 1050 nm) using samples of milk contaminated with four different adulterants (soda, urea, water and detergent) with known degree of contamination deliberately added in milk. In this study, we used the data in the range of 350 - 1050 nm to identify spectral signatures of different adulterants with different degree of concentration. Data cleansing, in the form of pre-processing was followed by machine learning techniques to create a model to capture the adulterants and also the degree of adulteration. Linear regression along with wrapper subset eval as attribute evaluator and best first search as search option was found to create the best model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Correlation Coefficient (CC) metrics were used to select the best model. The best model for detecting the degree of adulteration due to soda, urea, water and detergent in milk was found to have an RMSE of 0.027, 0.0069, 0.0382 and 0.0281 respectively while CC was 0.9919, 0.9997, 0.9887 and 0.9938 respectively. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the effective use of spectroradiometer and machine learning technique in reliably detecting adulterants in milk.","Kimbahune, S; Ghouse, SM; Mithun, BS; Shinde, S; Jha, AK",10.1117/12.2223439,conferencePaper,V6EHFJVA,2016,,1

Using a sentiment analysis for the examination of tourism blogs - a step by step methodological reflection process,NO,,,,"The article at hand is driven by a methodological interest in the opportunities and challenges of applying an automated text mining approach, particularly a sentiment analysis on various tourism blogs at the same time. The study aims to answer the question to what extent advanced computational methods can improve the data acquisition and analysis of unstructured data sets stemming from various blogs and forums. Furthermore, the authors intend to explore to what extent the sentiment analysis is able to objectify the qualitative results identified by an earlier analysis by the authors using content analysis done by thematic coding. For the purpose of the specific tourism research question in this paper a new approach is proposed, which consists of a combination of sentiment analyses, supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction in order to identify terms that strongly load on specific emotions. The contribution indicates on the one hand, that advanced computational methods have their own specific constraints, but on the other hand, are able to provide a richer and deeper analysis following a quantitative approach. Several issues have to be taken into account, such as data protection constraints, the need for data cleaning, such as word stemming, dimension reduction, such as removal of custom stop words, and the development of descent ontologies. On the other hand, the quantitative method also provides, due to its standardised procedure, a less subjective insight in the given content, but is not less time consuming than traditional content analysis.","Szepannek, G; Westphal, L; Gronau, W; Lehmann, T",10.1515/tw-2021-0011,journalArticle,3XVC2Q3T,2021,,1
Design and Validation of a Pilot Stress Monitoring System based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model,NO,,,,"This article presents the Design and Validation of a Stress Model based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) included in the Pilot Monitoring System (PMS) developed by Airbus Defence Space.Starting by introducing the whole system, PMS obtains pilot's vital data in real time with two wearable devices (smartwatch and ear sensor). It is able to determine stress, fatigue, workload, health status and pilot capacity with new models based on DCNN encoded in Python which are able to interpret these vital data.Additionally, PMS is able to launch alerts when the vital parameters of the crew reach pre-established limits, giving the chance to detect an abnormal situation (e.g. excessive workload scenario with high stress level). In this way, it will improve situational awareness by making crew aware of their own conditionGoing deeper into the details of the Stress Model, its main objective is to determine Pilot stress in real time.For achieving this target, several design stages were taken into consideration while building the Stress Model DCNN: raw data acquisition, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training, model evaluation, model testing, and result analysis. Further details of these stages are explained below.Regarding data acquisition, Stress Model obtains pilot's vital data from a smartwatch (one of the wearable devices of PMS), which communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a laptop. Selected device was Analog Devices Inc. Gen II watch, which sends the following signals: Heart Rate (HR), Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA), Skin temperature and 3D Acceleration.At Cleaning stage, Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) was used to normalize our raw data, being less sensitive to outliers and therefore more robust.At Feature engineering stage, several signal combinations were explored. The selected signal set which gave the best Stress Model accuracy was comprised of two EDA parameters (Real Admittance [Siemens], Impedance Magnitude [Ohm]) and wrist Skin Temperature [deg C].At Algorithm selection stage, three convolutional layers (128, 256 and 128 filters respectively) were chosen to extract a feature map from the inputs. After them, a Global Average Pooling (GAP) was chosen to compress the convolutions output. Downstream GAP, a decision layer based on softmax activation function (stress vs non-stress) was chosen.At Training stage, it was necessary to implement a Stress Test recording campaign. Participants were asked to fulfill several individual demanding tasks (memory, multi-task, stroop, vigilance) which included relaxing periods among them. The Stress Model was fed with the vital data obtained in this campaign.In between the tasks, NASA-TLX questionnaires were filled by test subjects, to obtain their subjective rating of Mental demand, Physical demand, Temporal demand, Performance, Effort and Frustration. Therefore, the Stress Model considered both vital data and self-report questionnaires as inputs.At result analysis stage, the Stress Model accuracy was refined, understanding accuracy as the ratio between correct predicted stress scenarios versus total cases, and considering ground truth self-report questionnaires.Finally, Stress Model DCNN was validated considering three data sources, whose details are included below:A.Vital data from fifteen (N=15) subjects of Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) Database available online.Stress Model gave an average test accuracy of 99%,B.Vital data from four (N=4) Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) pilots while calibrating their NASA-TLX scale.Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 90%.C.Vital data from six (N=6) ADS pilots while performing simulator evaluations using an Enhanced Light Weight Visor (ELWEV).Stress Model in this validation gave an average test accuracy of 87%.  2021 IEEE.","Meneses, Jaime; Miranda, Oscar; Sanchez, Ignacio; Alvarez, Cesar; Rodriguez, Pablo",10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594363,conferencePaper,G2RMVVMU,2021,,1

Review on detection and prediction methods for pavement skid resistance,NO,,,,"The relevant achievements and progress of skid resistance performance of pavements were systematically reviewed based on three aspects: mechanical mechanism, detection methods, and prediction models. The friction mechanism of pavement skid resistance was introduced based on the traditional Coulomb friction law, and the factors influencing the skid resistance were summarized based on road surface, tire, and contact environment. The direct and indirect measurement methods of skid resistance were evaluated, and the difficulties of road-surface texture detection and test data preprocessing methods were analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the skid resistance prediction methods, including traditional empirical statistical models, mechanical models, and machine learning, were compared and analyzed. Analysis results show that many factors influence the skid resistance of pavements, and it is difficult to describe the mechanical behavior of the third body between rubber and rough surface. Thus, further investigations are required to reveal the friction mechanism toward the contact interface with the lubrication medium.For the single function and high cost of the direct detection of skid resistance, surface texture detection using automatic high-speed noncontact measurements will be more in line with future intelligent integrated requirements. However, high-precision and large-range detection and data cleaning are still bottlenecks that need to break through. Compared to the existing prediction models, the tire-pavement contact characteristics are weakened by the empirical statistical model and machine learning, resulting in a lack of scalability in the prediction model. The implementation of the finite element simulation model method is expected to reveal the friction mechanism under complex physical fields to develop a more precise and efficient model for predicting the skid resistance of pavements.  2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

Deep learning methods improve linear B-cell epitope prediction,NO,,,,"Background: B-cell epitopes play important roles in vaccine design, clinical diagnosis, and antibody production. Although some models have been developed to predict linear or conformational B-cell epitopes, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Hundreds of thousands of linear B-cell epitope data have accumulated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). These data can be explored using the deep learning methods, in order to create better predictive models for linear B-cell epitopes. Results: After data cleaning, we obtained 240,563 peptide samples with experimental evidence from the IEDB database, including 25,884 linear B-cell epitopes and 214,679 non-epitopes. Based on the peptide center, we adapted each peptide to the same length by trimming or extending. A random portion of the data, with the same amount of epitopes and non-epitopes, were set aside as test dataset. Then a same number of epitopes and non-epitopes were randomly selected from the remaining data to build a classifier with the feedforward deep neural network. We built eleven classifiers to form an ensemble prediction model. The model will report a peptide as an epitope if it was classified as epitope by all eleven classifiers. Then we used the test data set to evaluate the performance of the model using the area value under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as an indicator. We established 40 models to predict linear B-cell epitopes of length from 11 to 50 separately, and found that the AUC value increased with the length and tended to be stable when the length was 38. Repeated results showed that the models constructed by this method were robust. Tested on our and two public test datasets, our models outperformed current major models available. Conclusions: We applied the feedforward deep neural network to the large amount of linear B-cell epitope data with experimental evidence in the IEDB database, and constructed ensemble prediction models with better performance than the current major models available. We named the models as DLBEpitope and provided web services using the models at http://ccb1.bmi.ac.cn:81/dlbepitope/.",Tao Liu; Kaiwen Shi; Wuju Li,10.1186/s13040-020-00211-0,journalArticle,2KHL73B6,2020,,1
Towards Real-time Learning for Edge-Cloud Continuum with Vehicular Computing,NO,,,,"Sensor-driven IoT systems are well-known for their capacity to accelerate massive amounts of data in a comparatively short period of time. To have any use, the information delivery and decision making based on the data require efficient learning models together with dynamically deployed computing and network resources. The current cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures, as well as modern edge computing systems especially in the 5G and beyond networks, can be addressed to resolve these challenges. However, there are several application areas especially in vehicular and urban computing, where just harnessing more computational power does not solve computational and real-time requirements of the modern sensing systems that operate in mobile and context-dependent environments. For now, the mathematical challenges of distributed computing and real-time learning algorithms have not been profoundly addressed in the context of the IoT and real-world sensing applications. Data-driven systems also require giving full attention to information delivery, data management, data cleaning, and sensor fusion technologies that need to be equally distributed and real-time competent as the learning algorithms themselves. New software-defined computing and networking approaches and architectures are required to orchestrate the numerous connected resources dynamically, controllably, and securely along with the evolving needs. The key challenge here is to uniform collaboration between different aspects of the system, from data processing and delivery to the algorithms and learning models, not forgetting the computational capacity and networking capabilities, all this in real-time with real-world applications.  2021 IEEE.","Peltonen, Ella; Sojan, Arun; Paivarinta, Tero",10.1109/WF-IoT51360.2021.9595628,conferencePaper,LUWUD3D3,2021,,1

Predicting ICD-9 code groups with fuzzy similarity based supervised multi-label classification of unstructured clinical nursing notes,NO,,,,"In hospitals, caregivers are trained to chronicle the subtle changes in the clinical conditions of a patient at regular intervals, for enabling decision-making. Caregivers text-based clinical notes are a significant source of rich patient-specific data, that can facilitate effective clinical decision support, despite which, this treasure-trove of data remains largely unexplored for supporting the prediction of clinical outcomes. The application of sophisticated data modeling and prediction algorithms with greater computational capacity have made disease prediction from raw clinical notes a relevant problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on vector space and topic modeling, to structure the raw clinical data by capturing the semantic information in the nursing notes. Fuzzy similarity based data cleansing approach was used to merge anomalous and redundant patient data. Furthermore, we utilize eight supervised multi-label classification models to facilitate disease (ICD-9 code group) prediction. We present an exhaustive comparative study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using standard evaluation metrics.

Beat-Based PPG-ABP Cleaning Technique for Blood Pressure Estimation,NO,,,,"A growing attention is given to exploiting Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals in non-invasively measuring of many physiological vital signs. Many machine deep learning models were trained for predicting the continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) or just the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) values based on a public database. However, jointly cleaning the PPG-ABP dataset that is the most critical pre-processing step for training quality is still in need for more investigations. There is a considerable amount of anomaly data that has to be excluded before any training stage. This paper introduces a two-level joint PPG-ABP cleaning technique conducted in a signal level and per-beat level. Many quality metrics have been checked successively for excluding improper data. These metrics achieve a coarse cleaning step. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) is exploited for fine cleaning the remaining data from the former stage. The cleaning efficiency is evaluated by measuring its impact on the deep-learning-based BP estimation models. The trained model based on our cleaned data shows performance enhancement in terms of prediction error and the correlation between the predicted and ground-truth BP. Segmented and cleaned PPG/ABP dataset will be publicly available in both signal level and beat level. Based on the simulation results, the proposed cleaning technique enhances standard deviation of the prediction error of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.68 % and 10.81 %, respectively. Also, it enhances mean absolute error of the prediction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 14.79 % and 11.70 %, respectively.  2013 IEEE.","Salah, Mostafa; Omer, Osama A.; Hassan, Loay; Ragab, Mohamed; Hassan, Ammar Mostafa; Abdelreheem, Ahmed",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3175436,journalArticle,7T85EXJ6,2022,,1

A Text Preprocessing Framework for Text Mining on Big Data Infrastructure,NO,,,,"There are many people using social media to comment appearance of a various event and post own activity in every day. The business organizations and industries can use social media to improve a produce by using the technique of text mining. However, a single machine cannot perform to compute a large amount of data because it has the resource limitation such as CPU, main memory, storage and so on. Moreover, a data also consists of structured and unstructured data that must be prepared before a computation with text mining or machine learning. Therefore, the text preprocessing becomes one of the most very important tasks because it includes many steps. In this paper, we design and develop an efficient text preprocessing framework on a big data infrastructure, which is proposed to support the text preprocessing task to reduce the computation time. The framework consists of the main four modules: Data collection module, storage module, data cleaning module and feature extraction module. We collected the sentiment data from Facebook page, named “Tasty” that has more than 90 million members for the performance evaluation. The data was separated into different three sizes and each dataset was tested on different the cluster system environments. Moreover, we also compared the computation time between the proposed our framework and the single machine. As the result, our framework can reduce the computation time significantly.

Current-Visit and Next-Visit Prediction for Fatty Liver Disease With a Large-Scale Dataset: Model Development and Performance Comparison,NO,,,,"Background: Fatty liver disease (FLD) arises from the accumulation of fat in the liver and may cause liver inflammation, which, if not well controlled, may develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma. Objective: We describe the construction of machine-learning models for current-visit prediction (CVP), which can help physicians obtain more information for accurate diagnosis, and next-visit prediction (NVP), which can help physicians provide potential high-risk patients with advice to effectively prevent FLD. Methods: The large-scale and high-dimensional dataset used in this study comes from Taipei MJ Health Research Foundation in Taiwan. We used one-pass ranking and sequential forward selection (SFS) for feature selection in FLD prediction. For CVP, we explored multiple models, including k-nearest-neighbor classifier (KNNC), Adaboost, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), decision trees C4.5 (C4.5), and classification and regression trees (CART). For NVP, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) and several of its variants as sequence classifiers that use various input sets for prediction. Model performance was evaluated based on two criteria: the accuracy of the test set and the intersection over union/coverage between the features selected by one-pass ranking/SFS and by domain experts. The accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for both CVP and NVP for males and females, respectively. Results: After data cleaning, the dataset included 34,856 and 31,394 unique visits respectively for males and females for the period 2009-2016. The test accuracy of CVP using KNNC, Adaboost, SVM, LR, RF, GNB, C4.5, and CART was respectively 84.28%, 83.84%, 82.22%, 82.21%, 76.03%, 75.78%, and 75.53%. The test accuracy of NVP using LSTM, bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM), Stack-LSTM, Stack-biLSTM, and Attention-LSTM was respectively 76.54%, 76.66%, 77.23%, 76.84%, and 77.31% for fixed-interval features, and was 79.29%, 79.12%, 79.32%, 79.29%, and 78.36%, respectively, for variable-interval features. Conclusions: This study explored a large-scale FLD dataset with high dimensionality. We developed FLD prediction models for CVP and NVP. We also implemented efficient feature selection schemes for current- and next-visit prediction to compare the automatically selected features with expert-selected features. In particular, NVP emerged as more valuable from the viewpoint of preventive medicine. For NVP, we propose use of feature set 2 (with variable intervals), which is more compact and flexible. We have also tested several variants of LSTM in combination with two feature sets to identify the best match for male and female FLD prediction. More specifically, the best model for males was Stack-LSTM using feature set 2 (with 79.32% accuracy), whereas the best model for females was LSTM using feature set 1 (with 81.90% accuracy).","Wu, CT; Chu, TW; Jang, JSR",10.2196/26398,journalArticle,TSU29BNX,2021,,1

Extracting hidden patterns within road accident data using machine learning techniques,NO,,,,"Road accidents may not be stopped altogether, but can be reduced. Driver emotions such as sad, happy, and anger can be one reason for accidents. At the same time, environment conditions such as weather, traffic on the road, load in the vehicle, type of road, health condition of driver, and speed can also be the reasons for accidents. Hidden patterns in accidents can be extracted so as to find the common features between accidents. This paper presents the results of the framework from the research study on road accident data of major national highways that pass through Krishna district for the year 2013 by applying machine learning techniques into analysis. These datasets collected from police stations are heterogeneous. Incomplete and erroneous values are corrected using data cleaning measures, and relevance attributes are identified using attribute selection measures. Clusters that are formed using K-medoids, and expectation maximization algorithms are then analyzed to discover hidden patterns using a priori algorithm. Results showed that the selected machine learning techniques are able to extract hidden patterns from the data. Density histograms are used for accident data visualization.

Delay estimation in fogs based on software-defined networking,NO,,,,"Fog computing brings the advantages and power of cloud computing to the edge of the network. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been considered as a feasible solution to cope with the complexity of the orchestration of fog devices. Nevertheless, the use of an SDN controller introduces delays into the transport of packet flows in the fog layer, which may impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications in the continuum IoT-Fog-Cloud. In this paper, we propose a regression model for predicting delay values in an SDN-based fog layer. To build up the regression model, we constructed a dataset, performed data cleaning, carried out feature selection, and applied different Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Our evaluation results reveal that the Random Forest (RF) technique overperforms Decision Tree (DT) and Neural Network (NN) techniques on predicting the delay in an SDN-based fog layer. Furthermore, the predicted delay values reinforce that a fog layer based on SDN can support different latency-sensitive applications.  2019 IEEE.","Casas-Velasco, Daniela M.; Villota-Jacome, William F.; Da Fonseca, Nelson L.

There has been some work towards understanding and debugging the early stages of the entity resolution pipeline, e.g. blocking and generating features (similarity scores). However, there are no such efforts for explaining the model or its predictions.

Automatic Data Cleaning System for Large-Scale Location Image Databases Using a Multilevel Extractor and Multiresolution Dissimilarity Calculation,Specific,,,,"In this article, we propose a system for automatically classifying and cleaning location images in large-scale image databases uploaded by arbitrary users. Detecting incorrect scenes uploaded by users and maintaining the correctness of the database through automatic data cleaning are essential because human inspection is not feasible for verifying massive amounts of data. In this study, we compared different feature extractors using deep convolutional neural networks trained using big data. We designed a multilevel extractor to improve feature extraction. Moreover, a detector based on multiresolution dissimilarity calculation was designed to overcome the issue of large intraclass distances and successfully identify incorrect scenes. The proposed system was validated using a highly challenging dataset with 138,000 images collected from Google Places. The experiments show that the multilevel extractor and the detector based on multiresolution dissimilarity calculation can improve the accuracy in identifying incorrect scenes and achieve satisfying data cleaning results.",Hsu-Yung Cheng; Chih-Chang Yu,10.1109/MIS.2020.3021704,journalArticle,F55F8ABL,2021,,1
Towards Using Universal Big Data in Artificial Intelligence Research and Development to Gain Meaningful Insights and Automation Systems,NO,,,,"The increasing number of human activities using information and communication technology (ICT) generates a tremendous amount of data. It brings the opportunity to use universal big data for further computation that may deliver new insights and automation system. The technology that enables this work is artificial intelligence (AI). As known, the utilization of AI technology is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily life. Furthermore, discussion related to AI has played an essential role in an organization's decision-making process. Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-to-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth. The end-to-end process begins with data collection covering various types of data (text, picture, audio, video, animation) and various methods (survey, observation, interview, experiment). Then, it continues with the pre-process data cleansing and process to determine data features, and seeks the relationship within them, using machine learning process with appropriate algorithms. The results may then be used for applications portfolio in order to improve organization strategies and programs. The organization's performance can be visualized from time to time for continuous quality improvement. The end-to-end cycles of processes continue, from data collection, data pre-processing and processing, performance computation monitoring (identification, classification, prediction, and prescription), improving strategy and program, and implementing in the real-life activities until generating more behavioral data, finding pattern and design the systems. As a whole, this end-to-end cycle leads us to an AI automation system, with the power to generate meaningful insights suited to solve current problems, predicting trending issues, and understanding phenomena.","Hasibuan, Z.A.",10.1109/IWBIS50925.2020.9255497,conferencePaper,5XQBFRYU,2020,,1

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Prediction using Deep Learning Model with Improved Meta-Heuristic Optimization Approach,NO,,,,"This research develops a deep learning-based covid-19 prediction model by going through four essential phases. The obtained raw data is first submitted to the pre-processing phase to enhance the data quality and improvement in prediction accuracy of the proposed model. The data normalization and data cleaning are undergone in the pre-processing phase. The most important aspects, such as statistical features (Mean, Median, Min-Max and Standard Deviation), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI), are retrieved from the pre-processed data. Self Improved Standard Spider Monkey Optimization algorithm (SI-SMO) is used to select the most optimal features. Following that, a new improved deep learning model, the optimized Deep Belief Network, is used to simulate the covid-19 prediction phase (DBN). DBN's weight is fine-tuned by the proposed SI-SMO algorithm. This parametric tuning of the model enriches its performance in predicting the disease. The outcome from optimized DBN portrays about the presence/absence of covid-19. Accordingly, the accuracy value accomplished by the proposed model is 0.951001582 at LP=60, which is 16.6%,19%,15.4%,14%, 2.6% and 5.3% better than the traditional models like SVM,RF,CNN, NB, WOA+DBN, EHO+DBN, MFO+DBN and SMO+DBN, respectively.  2022 IEEE","Rao, Jyothi Manjunath; Narayan, Bharathi Hassan",10.1109/ICSSIT53264.2022.9716478,conferencePaper,VPZH4T2U,2022,,1
Machine Learning: Data Pre‐processing,Specific,,,,"In prognostics and health management (PHM), data pre‐processing generally involves the following tasks: data cleansing, normalization, feature discovery, and imbalanced data management. Data cleansing is the process of detecting and correcting corrupt or inaccurate data. Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature extraction, also known as dimensionality reduction, is the transformation of high‐dimensional data into a meaningful representation of reduced dimensionality, which should have a dimensionality that corresponds to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is commonly used as a dimensionality reduction technique in the data pre‐processing step for classification and machine learning applications. Feature selection, also called variable selection/attribute selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm produces artificial data based on the feature space similarities between minority data points.",Michael G.

DETECTION OF ANOMALIES IN BPM SIGNALS AT THE VEPP-4M,NO,,,,"Beam position monitors (BPMs) are widely used for beam diagnostics in particle accelerators. Turn-by-turn (TbT) beam centroid data provide a means to estimate performance-critical accelerator parameters, like betatron frequency and optical functions. Parameter estimation accuracy is heavily related to TbT data quality. BPM faults might lead to erroneous estimation of accelerator parameters and should be accounted for achieving accurate and reliable results. Several anomaly detection methods for TbT data cleaning are considered. Derived features of BPM signals along with their robust dispersion estimation are used to ag faulty BPM signals.

Aggressive Driving Behavior Prediction Method Based on Attention Mechanism and Hierarchical Network,NO,,,,"Multi-dimensional driving behavior data, including driver characteristics, road environment, and vehicle operation variables, were collected based on natural driving experiments. Then, the standard database of aggressive driving behavior was created after data cleansing and filtering. The significance analysis was used to obtain useful indexes, with which an eight-dimensional index set for aggressive driving behavior prediction was built. Finally, a two-layer time series model for aggressive driving behavior prediction was constructed. The first layer of the model is an artificial neural network. The second layer of the model is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism module. It is shown that the proposed model can increase the prediction accuracy by 10%;the two-layer structure and attention mechanism have a good improvement for the prediction accuracy (5% and 3%, respectively).  2022, Editorial Department of Journal of Tongji University.

"Analytics on Non-Normalized Data Sources: More Learning, Rather Than More Cleaning",NO,,,,"Data analysis is increasingly performed over data assembled from uncontrolled sources, facing inconsistency in knowledge-representation conventions. The typical practice is to create 'clean' data for analysis, matching entities and merging variants to overcome differences in knowledge representation. Despite progress in data management techniques to automate this process, it still needs labor-intensive supervision from the analyst. In this paper, we evaluate the benefit of advanced statistical tools to address directly many analytic tasks across data sources without such entity-matching cleaning. Reframing analytical questions as machine-learning tasks enables to replace exact matching of entities by continuous descriptions-vectorial embeddings- that expose similarities between entries. But are analyses with less cleaning trustworthy? We answer this question with a thorough benchmark on questions typical of socio-economic studies across 14 employee databases: we compare the approaches based on machine learning to manual data cleaning (entity matching). It reveals that using embeddings and machine learning improves results validity (smaller estimation error) more than manual cleaning, with considerably less human labor. While machine learning is often combined with data management for the purpose of cleaning, our study suggests that using it directly for analysis is beneficial because it captures ambiguities hard to represent during curation.  2013 IEEE.","Cvetkov-Iliev, Alexis; Allauzen, Alexandre; Varoquaux, Gael",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168013,journalArticle,GURA7M5K,2022,,1

Early Prediction of Neoplasms Using Machine Learning: A Study of Electronic Health Records from the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs in Saudi Arabia,NO,,,,"The early detection and treatment of neoplasms, and in particular the malignant, can save lives. However, identifying those most at risk of developing neoplasms remains challenging. Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide a rich source of 'big' data on large numbers of patients. We hypothesised that in the period preceding a definitive diagnosis, there exists a series of ordered healthcare events captured within EHR data that characterise the onset and progression of neoplasms that can be exploited to predict future neoplasms occurrence. Using data from the EHR of the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNG-HA), a large healthcare provider in Saudi Arabia, we aimed to discover health event patterns present in EHR data that predict the development of neoplasms in the year prior to diagnosis. After data cleaning, pre-processing, and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5,466 patients were available for model construction: 1,715 cases and 3,751 controls. Two predictive models were developed (using Decision tree (DT), and Random Forests (RF)). Age, gender, ethnicity, and ICD-10-chapter (broad disease classification) codes as predictor variables and the presence or absence of neoplasms as the output variable. The common factors associated with a diagnosis of neoplasms within one or more years after their occurrence across all the models were: (1) age at neoplasms/event diagnosis; (2) gender; and patient medical history of (3) diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving immune mechanisms, and (4) diseases of the genitourinary system. Model performance assessment showed that RF has higher Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.76 whereas the DT was less complex. This study is a demonstration that EHR data can be used to predict future neoplasm occurrence.  2022 The authors and IOS Press.","Abdullah Alfayez, Asma; Grace Lai, Alvina; Kunz, Holger",10.3233/SHTI210853,conferencePaper,2YBV4D5B,2022,,1

iGOS++: integrated gradient optimized saliency by bilateral perturbations,NO,,,,"The black-box nature of the deep networks makes the explanation for ""why"" they make certain predictions extremely challenging. Saliency maps are one of the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing for a mask over the input dimensions so that the output of the network for a given class is influenced the most. However, prior work only studies such influence by removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework to generate saliency maps for blackbox networks by considering both removal and preservation of evidence. Additionally, we introduce the bilateral total variation term to the optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under high resolution and with thin object parts. We validate the capabilities of iGOS++ by extensive experiments and comparison against state-of-the-art saliency map methods. Our results show significant improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by humans. Besides, we showcased the capabilities of our method, iGOS++, in a real-world application of AI on medical data: the task of classifying COVID-19 cases from x-ray images. To our surprise, we discovered that sometimes the classifier is overfitted to the text characters printed on the x-ray images when performing classification rather than focusing on the evidence in the lungs. Fixing this overfitting issue by data cleansing significantly improved the precision and recall of the classifier.","Khorram, S.; Lawson, T.; Fuxin, L.",10.1145/3450439.3451865,conferencePaper,36ZJHCTS,2021,,1

DyReT: A Dynamic Rule Framing Engine Equipped With Trust Management for Vehicular Networks,NO,,,,"Managing a dynamic traffic system is a challenging task in vehicular environments. Clarity of vehicular data for efficient decision making is vital in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Huge volumes of vehicular data are collected and processed during vehicular transactions. Pre-processing the huge amounts of raw vehicular data followed by framing effective traffic rules to take appropriate rapid decisions by the ITS on the vehicles continues to be a challenging problem. Most of the current studies done on ITS have proposed decision making strategies to handle only specific vehicular events and many lacked framing intelligent dynamic decision rules along with appropriate actions, representing all traffic events prevailing in the vehicular environment. This study proposes a versatile decision engine implanted with a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, we propose a novel data cleaning algorithm to identify and remove dirty data from the voluminous vehicular dataset. In the second stage, a unique rule framing mechanism is suggested to frame dynamic traffic rules along with their actions using real-time vehicular data. The vehicular entities take suitable decisions to respond to the traffic events based on these rules and their associated actions. A new Naïve Bayesian classifier is proposed in this study to test the new rule framed with the trained rules set, either to accept or reject the new rule for further processing. The algorithms are developed and implemented using machine learning concepts. Experimental and comparative analysis was carried out with other related referred studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. Although the proposed decision engine is generic enough for decision making in most ITS use-cases, discussion in this article elaborates on its applicability in use-cases provisioning trust management.",H.

Pseudo label method is further applied on unlabeled data to increase samples for confident learning and improve the classification performance of subsequent node classification module.

Mining online political opinion surveys for suspect entries: An interdisciplinary comparison,NO,,,,"Filtering data generated by so-called Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) in order to remove entries that exhibit unrealistic behavior (i.e., cannot correspond to a real political view) is of primary importance. If such entries are significantly present in VAA generated datasets, they can render conclusions drawn from VAA data analysis invalid. In this work we investigate approaches that can be used for automating the process of identifying entries that appear to be suspicious in terms of a users’ answer patterns. We utilize two unsupervised data mining techniques and compare their performance against a well established psychometric approach. Our results suggest that the performance of data mining approaches is comparable to those drawing on psychometric theory with a fraction of the complexity. More specifically, our simulations show that data mining techniques as well as psychometric approaches can be used to identify truly ‘rogue’ data (i.e., completely random data injected into the dataset under investigation). However, when analysing real datasets the performance of all approaches dropped considerably. This suggests that ‘suspect’ entries are neither random nor clustered. This finding poses some limitations on the use of unsupervised techniques, suggesting that the latter can only complement rather than substitute existing methods to identifying suspicious entries.","Djouvas, Costantinos; Mendez, Fernando; Tsapatsoulis, Nicolas",10.1016/j.jides.2016.11.003,journalArticle,RX546X7F,2016,,1

A survey and analysis of intrusion detection models based on CSE-CIC-IDS2018 Big Data,NO,,,,"The exponential growth in computer networks and network applications worldwide has been matched by a surge in cyberattacks. For this reason, datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018 were created to train predictive models on network-based intrusion detection. These datasets are not meant to serve as repositories for signature-based detection systems, but rather to promote research on anomaly-based detection through various machine learning approaches. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 contains about 16,000,000 instances collected over the course of ten days. It is the most recent intrusion detection dataset that is big data, publicly available, and covers a wide range of attack types. This multi-class dataset has a class imbalance, with roughly 17% of the instances comprising attack (anomalous) traffic. Our survey work contributes several key findings. We determined that the best performance scores for each study, where available, were unexpectedly high overall, which may be due to overfitting. We also found that most of the works did not address class imbalance, the effects of which can bias results in a big data study. Lastly, we discovered that information on the data cleaning of CSE-CIC-IDS2018 was inadequate across the board, a finding that may indicate problems with reproducibility of experiments. In our survey, major research gaps have also been identified.","Leevy, J.L.; Khoshgoftaar, T.M.",10.1186/s40537-020-00382-x,journalArticle,5IYZANW3,2020,,1
Predictive System of Semiconductor Failures based on Machine Learning Approach,NO,,,,"Maintenance in manufacturing has been developed and researched in the last few decades at a very rapid rate.

The problem of data cleaning for knowledge extraction from social media,Specific,,,,"Social media platforms let users share their opinions through textual or multimedia content. In many settings, this becomes a valuable source of knowledge that can be exploited for specific business objectives. In this work, we report on an implementation aiming at cleaning the data collected from social content, within specific domains or related to given topics of interest. Indeed, topic-based collection of social media content is performed through keyword-based search, which typically entails very noisy results. Therefore we propose a method for data cleaning and removal of off-topic content based on supervised machine learning techniques, i.e. classification, over data collected from social media platforms based on keywords regarding a specific topic. We define a general method for this and then we validate it through an experiment of data extraction from Twitter, with respect to a set of famous cultural institutions in Italy, including theaters, museums, and other venues. For this case, we collaborated with domain experts to label the dataset, and then we evaluated and compared the performance of classifiers that are trained with different feature extraction strategies.

"Application of machine learning algorithms for optimizing future production in Marcellus shale, case study of Southwestern Pennsylvania",NO,,,,"The Marcellus Shale has more than a decade of development history. However, there are many questions that still remain unanswered. What is the best inter-well spacing? What are the optimum stage length, proppant loading, and cluster spacing? What are the ideal combinations of these completion parameters? And how can we maximize the rate return on our investment? This study proposes innovative tools that allow researchers to answer these questions. We build these set of tools by utilizing the pattern recognition abilities of machine learning algorithms and public data from the Southwestern Pennsylvania region of the Marcellus Shale. By means of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, we studied a database that includes public data from more than 2,000 wells producing from the aforementioned study area. The database contained completion, drilling, and production history information from various operators active in Allegheny, Greene, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland counties located in the Southwestern Pennsylvania. Extensive preprocessing and data cleansing steps were involved to prepare the database. Various machine learning techniques (Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Gaussian Processes (GP)) were applied to understand the non-linear patterns in the data. The objective was to develop predictive models that were trained and validated based on the current database. The predictive models were validated using information originating from numerous wells in the area. Once validated, the model could be used in reservoir management decision-making workflows to answer questions such as what are the best drilling scenarios, the optimum hydraulic fracturing design, the initial production rate, and the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). The workflow is purely based on field data and free of any cognitive human bias. As soon as more data is available, the model could be updated. The core data in this workflow is sourced from public domains, and therefore, intensive preprocessing efforts were necessary.  2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers.","Shahkarami, Alireza; Ayers, Kimberly; Wang, Guochang; Ayers, Alivia",10.2118/191827-18erm-ms,conferencePaper,GHKX5TEG,2018,,1

Critical Parameter Identification for Safety Events in Commercial Aviation Using Machine Learning,NO,,,,"In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the application of data science techniques that leverage aviation data collected from commercial airline operations to improve safety. This paper presents the application of machine learning to improve the understanding of risk factors during flight and their causal chains. With increasing complexity and volume of operations, rapid accumulation and analysis of this safety-related data has the potential to maintain and even lower the low global accident rates in aviation. This paper presents the development of an analytical methodology called Safety Analysis of Flight Events (SAFE) that synthesizes data cleaning, correlation analysis, classification-based supervised learning, and data visualization schema to streamline the isolation of critical parameters and the elimination of tangential factors for safety events in aviation. The SAFE methodology outlines a robust and repeatable framework that is applicable across heterogeneous data sets containing multiple aircraft, airport of operations, and phases of flight. It is demonstrated on Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data from a commercial airline through use cases related to three safety events, namely Tire Speed Event, Roll Event, and Landing Distance Event. The application of the SAFE methodology yields a ranked list of critical parameters in line with subject-matter expert conceptions of these events for all three use cases. The work concludes by raising important issues about the compatibility levels of machine learning and human conceptualization of incidents and their precursors, and provides initial guidance for their reconciliation.","HyunKi Lee; Madar, S.; Sairam, S.; Puranik, T.G.; Payan, A.P.; Kirby, M.; Pinon, O.J.; Mavris, D.N.",10.3390/aerospace7060073,journalArticle,LV3IEURD,2020,,1
NowDeepN: An Ensemble of Deep Learning Models for Weather Nowcasting Based on Radar Products' Values Prediction,NO,,,,"One of the hottest topics in today's meteorological research is Weather nowcasting, which is the weather forecast for a short time period such as one to six hours. Radar is an important data source used by operational meteorologists for issuing nowcasting warnings. With the main goal of helping meteorologists in analysing radar data for issuing nowcasting warnings, we propose NowDeepN, a supervised learning based regression model which uses an ensemble of deep artificial neural networks for predicting the values for radar products at a certain time moment. The values predicted by NowDeepN may be used by meteorologists in estimating the future development of potential severe phenomena and would replace the time consuming process of extrapolating the radar echoes. NowDeepN is intended to be a proof of concept for the effectiveness of learning from radar data relevant patterns that would be useful for predicting future values for radar products based on their historical values. For assessing the performance of NowDeepN, a set of experiments on real radar data provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration is conducted. The impact of a data cleaning step introduced for correcting the erroneous radar products' values is investigated both from the computational and meteorological perspectives. The experimental results also indicate the relevance of the features considered in the supervised learning task, highlighting that the radar products' values at a certain geographical location at a time moment may be predicted from the products' values from a neighboring area of that location at previous time moments. An overall Normalized Root Mean Squared Error less than 4% was obtained for NowDeepN on the cleaned radar data. Compared to similar related work from the nowcasting literature, NowDeepN outperforms several approaches and this emphasizes the performance of our proposal.","Czibula, G; Mihai, A; Mihulet, E",10.3390/app11010125,journalArticle,FNSNKUPH,2021,,1

CompanyName2Vec: Company Entity Matching Based on Job Ads,NO,,,,"Entity Matching is an essential part of all real-world systems that take in structured and unstructured data coming from different sources. Typically no common key is available for connecting records. Massive data cleaning and integration processes require completion before any data analytics, or further processing can be performed. Although record linkage is frequently regarded as a somewhat tedious but necessary step, it reveals valuable insights, supports data visualization, and guides further analytic approaches to the data. Here, we focus on organization entity matching. We introduce CompanyName2Vec, a novel algorithm to solve company entity matching (CEM) using a neural network model to learn company name semantics from a job ad corpus, without relying on any information on the matched company besides its name. Based on a real-world data, we show that CompanyName2Vec outperforms other evaluated methods and solves the CEM challenge with an average success rate of 89.3%. Copyright  2022, The Authors.

EfficientCLIP: Efficient cross-modal pre-training by Ensemble Confident Learning and language modeling,YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC","img, text",label,"While large scale pre-training has achieved great achievements in bridging the gap between vision and language, it still faces several challenges. First, the cost for pre-training is expensive. Second, there is no efficient way to handle the data noise which degrades model performance. Third, previous methods only leverage limited image-text paired data, while ignoring richer single-modal data, which may result in poor generalization to single-modal downstream tasks. In this work, we propose an EfficientCLIP method via Ensemble Confident Learning to obtain a less noisy data subset. Extra rich non-paired single-modal text data is used for boosting the generalization of text branch. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on Chinese cross-modal retrieval tasks with only 1/10 training resources compared to CLIP and WenLan, while showing excellent generalization to single-modal tasks including text retrieval and text classification.

Weakly supervised change detection using guided anisotropic diffusion,NO,,,,"Large scale datasets created from crowdsourced labels or openly available data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised learning techniques. In this paper we propose original ideas that help us to leverage such datasets in the context of change detection. First, we propose the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level labels. Improvements with respect to state-of-the-art are demonstrated on 4 different public datasets.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Daudt, Rodrigo Caye; Le Saux, Bertrand; Boulch, Alexandre; Gousseau, Yann",10.1007/s10994-021-06008-4,journalArticle,9XNM9H7T,2021,,1
Time Series Prediction Technology Based on Frequency-Temporal Convolution Network,NO,,,,"In the era of big data, we begin to use artificial intelligence algorithms for data mining and prediction of force activities. If we can build a model based on historical data features to predict the deployment of equipment and personnel in key areas, we can preempt and gain an advantage on the battlefield. A frequency-driven temporal convolution network TFCN (Frequency-Temporal Convolution Network) is introduced based on the theoretical framework of deep learning and combining the time and frequency domain features of data in the traditional digital signal processing field. Inspired by Shannon&amp;#x2019;s sampling theorem, to achieve the purpose of fast learning of time series data features, it is necessary to satisfy the sampling frequency greater than twice the frequency of the principal components of time series data, ie., to ensure that the network structure and parameters sample the features-within at least one-half of the main period of the data, and then optimize the division of the data set and the design of the network structure. In this paper, -we standardize the time series data after data cleaning, and demonstrate that the above process does not affect the frequency distribution of the original data. We build the model to achieve prediction and evaluation, and the experiment result indicates that the TFCN we proposed can learn the characteristics of time series data faster than DNN, LSTM and other models, its loss curve can converge faster, and the prediction results are more accurate.",L.

Time-domain global similarity method for automatic data cleaning for multi-channel measurement systems in magnetic confinement fusion devices,NO,,,,"To guarantee the availability and reliability of data source in Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices, incorrect diagnostic data, which cannot reflect real physical properties of measured objects, should be sorted out before further analysis and study. Traditional data sorting cannot meet the growing demand of MCF research because of the low-efficiency, time-delay, and lack of objective criteria. In this paper, a Time-Domain Global Similarity (TDGS) method based on machine learning technologies is proposed for the automatic data cleaning of MCF devices. The aim of traditional data sorting is to classify original diagnostic data sequences. The lengths and evolution properties of the data sequences vary shot by shot. Hence the classification criteria are affected by many discharge parameters and are different in various discharges. The focus of the TDGS method is turned to the physical similarity between data sequences from different channels, which are more independent of discharge parameters. The complexity arisen from real discharge parameters during data cleaning is avoided in the TDGS method by transforming the general data sorting problem into a binary classification problem about the physical similarity between data sequences. As a demonstration of its application to multi-channel measurement systems, the TDGS method is applied to the EAST POlarimeterINTerferometer (POINT) system. The optimal performance of the method evaluated by 24-fold cross-validation has reached 0.9871  0.0385.  2018","Lan, Ting; Liu, Jian; Qin, Hong; Xu, Lin Li",10.1016/j.cpc.2018.07.014,journalArticle,CHU9J5WT,2019,,1

GEDet: Adversarially Learned Few-shot Detection of Erroneous Nodes in Graphs,NO,,,,"Detecting nodes with erroneous information in graphs is important yet challenging, due to the lack of examples and the diversified scenarios of errors. We introduce GEDet, a few-shot learning based framework to detect erroneous nodes in graphs. GEDet consists of two novel components, each addresses a unique challenge. (1) To cope with the lack of examples, we introduce a graph augmentation module to enrich training labels. The module not only generates additional synthetic training labels by simulating different erroneous scenarios, but also exploits non-local relations to enrich neighborhood information. (2) To further improve the accuracy, we introduce an adversarially learned module that can better detect erroneous nodes by distinguishing nodes with synthetic and real labels encoded by graph autoencoders. Unlike conventional error detection models, GEDet yields effective classifiers that are optimized for a few yet diversified examples in the presence of multiple error scenarios. We show that using only a small number of examples, GEDet significantly improves the competing methods such as constraint based detection and anomaly detection, with a gain of 35% on recall, and 30% on precision.","Guan, S; Lin, P; Ma, HC; Wu, YH",10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377897,conferencePaper,TEPX56A3,2020,,1
Benchmarking Machine Learning Models to Assist in the Prognosis of Tuberculosis,NO,,,,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by organisms in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex. In many low and middle-income countries, TB remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Once a patient has been diagnosed with TB, it is critical that healthcare workers make the most appropriate treatment decision given the individual conditions of the patient and the likely course of the disease based on medical experience. Depending on the prognosis, delayed or inappropriate treatment can result in unsatisfactory results including the exacerbation of clinical symptoms, poor quality of life, and increased risk of death. This work benchmarks machine learning models to aid TB prognosis using a Brazilian health database of confirmed cases and deaths related to TB in the State of Amazonas. The goal is to predict the probability of death by TB thus aiding the prognosis of TB and associated treatment decision making process. In its original form, the data set comprised 36,228 records and 130 fields but suffered from missing, incomplete, or incorrect data. Following data cleaning and preprocessing, a revised data set was generated comprising 24,015 records and 38 fields, including 22,876 reported cured TB patients and 1139 deaths by TB. To explore how the data imbalance impacts model performance, two controlled experiments were designed using (1) imbalanced and (2) balanced data sets. The best result is achieved by the Gradient Boosting (GB) model using the balanced data set to predict TB-mortality, and the ensemble model composed by the Random Forest (RF), GB and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models is the best model to predict the cure class.","Barros, MHLFD; Alves, GO; Souza, LMF; Rocha, ED; de Oliveira, JFL; Lynn, T; Sampaio, V; Endo, PT",10.3390/informatics8020027,journalArticle,7GBJEKIR,2021,,1

Evolving Fully Automated Machine Learning via Life-Long Knowledge Anchors,related,,,,"Automated machine learning (AutoML) has achieved remarkable progress on various tasks, which is attributed to its minimal involvement of manual feature and model designs. However, most of existing AutoML pipelines only touch parts of the full machine learning pipeline, e.g., neural architecture search or optimizer selection. This leaves potentially important components such as data cleaning and model ensemble out of the optimization, and still results in considerable human involvement and suboptimal performance. The main challenges lie in the huge search space assembling all possibilities over all components, as well as the generalization ability over different tasks like image, text, and tabular etc. In this paper, we present a first-of-its-kind fully AutoML pipeline, to comprehensively automate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model generation/selection/training and ensemble for an arbitrary dataset and evaluation metric. Our innovation lies in the comprehensive scope of a learning pipeline, with a novel 'life-long' knowledge anchor design to fundamentally accelerate the search over the full search space. Such knowledge anchors record detailed information of pipelines and integrates them with an evolutionary algorithm for joint optimization across components. Experiments demonstrate that the result pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and modalities.

Similarity-learning information-fusion schemes for missing data imputation,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Missing data imputation is a very important data cleaning task for machine learning and data mining with incomplete data. This paper proposes two novel methods for missing data imputation, named kEMI and kEMI+, that are based on the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for pre-imputation and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for posterior-imputation. The former is a local search mechanism that aims to automatically find the best value for k and the latter makes use of the best k nearest neighbours to estimate missing scores by learning global similarities. kEMI+ makes use of a novel information fusion mechanism. It fuses top estimations through the Dempster-Shafer fusion module to obtain the final estimation. They handle both numerical and categorical features. The performance of the proposed imputation techniques are evaluated by applying them on twenty one publicly available datasets with different missingness and ratios, and, then, compared with other state-of-the-art missing data imputation techniques in terms of standard evaluation measures such as the normalized root mean square difference and the absolute error.

Evaluation on both image and video retrieval applications highlight the utility of our approach. We highlight our efficiency in modeling local noise using two real-world datasets: Clothing1M and Honda Driving datasets. Qualitative results illustrate our ability in identifying confusing scenarios in various domains. Uncertainty learning also enables data cleaning by detecting noisy training labels.

Short-Term Energy Forecasting Framework Using an Ensemble Deep Learning Approach,NO,,,,"Industrial and building sectors demand efficient smart energy strategies, techniques of optimization, and efficient management for reducing global energy consumption due to the increasing world population. Nowadays, various artificial intelligence (AI) based methods are utilized to perform optimal energy forecasting, different simulation tools, and engineering methods to predict future demand based on historical data. Nevertheless, nonlinear energy demand modeling is still unfledged for a better solution to handle short-term and long-term dependencies and avoid static nature because it is purely on historical data-driven. In this paper, we propose an ensemble deep learning-based approach to predict and forecast energy demand and consumption by using chronological dependencies. Our system initially processes the data, cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the model performance. Furthermore, the preprocess data is fed to proposed ensemble model to extract hybrid discriminative features by using convolution neural network (CNN), stacked, and bi-directional long-short term memory (LSTM) architectures. We trained our proposed system on the historical data to forecast the energy demand and consumption with a different time interval. In the proposed technique, we utilized the concept of active learning based on moving windows to ensure and improve the prediction performance of the system. The proposed system could be applicable to employ energy consumption in industrial and building sectors to demonstrate their significance and effectiveness. We evaluated the proposed system by using benchmark, residential UCI, and local Korean commercial building datasets. We conducted different extensive experimentation to show the error rate and used various kinds of evaluation matrices, which indicate the lower error rate of the proposed system.  2013 IEEE.","Mustaqeem; Ishaq, Muhammad; Kwon, Soonil",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3093053,journalArticle,MG2GEYYG,2021,,1

A generative adversarial neural network model for industrial boiler data repair,Specific,,,,"Many achievements have been made in using neural networks to predict complex nonlinear industrial activities. The assumption that these prediction models established is that the various data collected by the sensors are available and accurate. However, accidents always happen beyond assumptions. The interference and damage of sensors are common phenomena in actual industrial production. In this case, the data collected by the sensors is incorrect and unavailable and cannot be fed into the prediction model for work. Incorrect data leads to inaccurate predictions, and the predictions lead to incorrect actions, which ultimately affect the activities of the entire industrial assembly line. How is this kind of problem data dealt with? This is the first time that generative adversarial networks (GAN) technology has been used to repair missing boiler data. Although GAN technology was originally used for image processing, we took the lead in transferring this technology to the issue of boiler data repair. Furthermore, we proposed a novel model structure that is more suitable for boiler data repair.

Student performance prediction using XGBoost method from a macro perspective,NO,,,,"Student performance prediction has attracted more and more attention in the educational data mining field in recent years. An accurate and useful forecast on student performance can play a huge role in many aspects, such as solving student dropout, allocating teaching resources reasonably, and improving teaching methods. In this paper, we employed an XGBoost-based method to forecast student performance. Instead of using individual students as samples, we used a novel educational dataset structured from a macro perspective, which rarely appeared in existing research. We used data cleaning, feature selection, and feature creation to increase the model's generalizability and the accuracy of the predictions. The XGBoost model achieved the best results than five other classic machine learning models (i.e., Random Forest, Lasso, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree).

"STREAMLINE: A Simple, Transparent, End-To-End Automated Machine Learning Pipeline Facilitating Data Analysis and Algorithm Comparison",NO,,,,"Machine learning (ML) offers powerful methods for detecting and modeling associations often in data with large feature spaces and complex associations. Many useful tools/packages (e.g. scikit-learn) have been developed to make the various elements of data handling, processing, modeling, and interpretation accessible. However, it is not trivial for most investigators to assemble these elements into a rigorous, replicatable, unbiased, and effective data analysis pipeline. Automated machine learning (AutoML) seeks to address these issues by simplifying the process of ML analysis for all. Here, we introduce STREAMLINE, a simple, transparent, end-to-end AutoML pipeline designed as a framework to easily conduct rigorous ML modeling and analysis (limited initially to binary classification). STREAMLINE is specifically designed to compare performance between datasets, ML algorithms, and other AutoML tools. It is unique among other autoML tools by offering a fully transparent and consistent baseline of comparison using a carefully designed series of pipeline elements including: (1) exploratory analysis, (2) basic data cleaning, (3) cross validation partitioning, (4) data scaling and imputation, (5) filter-based feature importance estimation, (6) collective feature selection, (7) ML modeling with 'Optuna' hyperparameter optimization across 15 established algorithms (including less well-known Genetic Programming and rule-based ML), (8) evaluation across 16 classification metrics, (9) model feature importance estimation, (10) statistical significance comparisons, and (11) automatically exporting all results, plots, a PDF summary report, and models that can be easily applied to replication data.  2022, CC BY.","Urbanowicz, Ryan J.; Zhang, Robert; Cui, Yuhan; Suri, Pranshu",10.48550/arXiv.2206.12002,journalArticle,RJDVG9K7,2022,,1

Efficiency Enhancement of Machine Learning Approaches through the Impact of Preprocessing Techniques,NO,,,,"A prediction system is affected by numerous factors. The primary factor is the depiction and traits of instance data. In the presence of unnecessary and redundant data or boisterous and deceptive information, it becomes arduous to discover knowledge during the training phase. One of the persistent challenges in data analytics is identifying and rectifying dirty data. The outcomes will be unreliable decisions and inaccurate analytics if an individual fails to do so. It is known by a large mass of people that the machine learning model performances are affected by the quality of data. Consequently, a significant amount of time is spent by the scientists on cleaning data before model training. Data pre-processing is considered the fundamental stage of ML methods by countless researchers. Nevertheless, only a fraction of works have paid emphasis on the consequences of data processing techniques. This paper addresses the serious impact that issues of data pre-processing can have on the generality performance of an ML algorithm and here all the pre-processing techniques like removal of missing values with all the possible methods, data binning, and data normalization, etc. are discussed. After performing all the pre-processing techniques, divide the dataset into training and testing datasets and then apply machine learning algorithms. It is concluded that to achieve a reliable result or better accuracy data preprocessing plays a very important role and to build a machine learning model we must have deep knowledge of all the pre-processing techniques, also where and how to apply them.","Gulati, V.; Raheja, N.",10.1109/ISPCC53510.2021.9609474,conferencePaper,7JEJXG8P,2021,,1

On the basis of sparse sensor events, the network continually predicts whether the participants would attend to a notification within 10 minutes. Compared to a random baseline, the classifier achieves a 40% performance increase (AUC of 0.702) on a withheld test set.

Encoding High-Cardinality String Categorical Variables,NO,,,,"Statistical models usually require vector representations of categorical variables, using for instance one-hot encoding. This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture morphological information in their representation. Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: Scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: A Gamma-Poisson matrix factorizationon substring counts, and a min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: If scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.  2020 IEEE.","Cerda, Patricio; Varoquaux, Gael",10.1109/TKDE.2020.2992529,journalArticle,BDI3ZGMQ,2022,,1
Customer Churn Prediction in the Iranian Banking Sector,NO,,,,"in the financial system such as the banking sector, customers are valuable, and losing them is very expensive as customer churn is a major challenge facing banks. In this paper, we present a time series Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based approach for customer retention, in which a dataset has been collected from retail banking customers in the Republic Islamic of Iran. The dataset consists of real daily transactional data of about 50,000 customers in Pasargad bank in the months of November and December 2021. The goal of this study is to perform a highly churned customer predictor, attempting to observe the customer information in 30 days and predict the customer behavior in the next 30 days. Also, unlike other research in this field where the labels of customers are already determined, we present a new definition of the churned banking customer to label the data. Then, the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and prepared to import to a Bi-LSTM neural network. The proposed model has shown a significant superiority over Traditional Machine Learning Techniques. This paper can guide researchers in the field of banking and artificial intelligence, providing business knowledge to managers in the banking sector to reduce the risk of losing their customers.","Haddadi, S.J.; Mohammadi, M.O.; Bahrami, M.; Khoeini, E.; Beygi, M.; Khoshkar, M.H.",10.1109/ICAPAI55158.2022.9801574,conferencePaper,UQFA4Z6Z,2022,,1
Daily Variation Laws and Prediction Methods in Photovoltaic Power Generation on Sunny Days,NO,,,,"This paper studies the variation law of the daily and annual scale photovoltaic(PV) power generation according to ""sunny weather mode"". A sunny photovoltaic power prediction model is proposed, and the phased real-time correction system based on optical power monitoring information is added. The method realizes the power generation predictability of photovoltaic power plants that combines previous predictions with ultra-short-term prediction. Application results of the Republican Photovoltaic Power Station in the upper reaches of the Yellow River indicate that the overall average prediction error of the proposed sunny photovoltaic power prediction model is 2%. Other methods used for PV power prediction such as linear regression, neural networks, and support vector machines have error detection intervals of 8%-20% under the same conditions. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is greatly improved. The proposed model does not require information such as the amount of radiation, cloud layer, air pressure, and precipitation, which are difficult to obtain. The model provides a simple, practical, and innovative prediction method.  2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Tianjin University(Science and Technology).

Field data analysis and risk assessment of gas kick during industrial deepwater drilling process based on supervised learning algorithm,NO,,,,"During industrial offshore deep-water drilling process, gas kick event occurs frequently due to extremely narrow Mud Weight (MW) window (minimum 0.01sg) and negligible safety margins for the well control purposes. Further, traditional gas kick detection methods in such environments have significant time-lag and can often lead to severe well control issues, and occasionally to well blowouts or borehole abandonment. In this study, firstly, the raw field data is processed through data collection, data cleaning, feature scaling, outlier detection, data labeling and dataset splitting. Additionally, a novel data labeling criterion for gas kick risks is proposed where five kick risks (Indicated by different colors in this study) are defined based on three key indicators: differential flow out (DFO), kick gain volume (Vol), and kick duration time (Time). Kick risk status represents one of the following cases: Case 0 - No indicators are activated (Green), Case 1 - Multi-drilling parameters deviation or DFO is activated (Orange), Case 2 - DFO and Vol are simultaneously activated (Light Red), Case 3 - DFO and Time are simultaneously activated (Light Red), Case 4 - DFO, Vol and Time alarms are simultaneously activated (Dark Red). Then, a novel data mining method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is presented for early detection of gas kick events by analyzing time series data from field drilling process. The network parameters such as number of hidden layers and number of neurons are initialized to build the LSTM network. The learned LSTM model is evaluated using the testing set, and the best LSTM model (six (6)-layers eighty (80)-nodes (6 L*80 N)) is optimally selected and deployed. The accuracy of deployed LSTM model is 87 % in the testing dataset, which is reliable enough to identify the kick fault during the deep-water drilling field operation. Lastly, the LSTM model detected the gas kick events earlier than the ""Tank Volume"" detection method in several representative case studies to conclude that the application of LSTM model can potentially improve well control safety in the deep-water wells with narrow MW windows.  2020","Yin, Qishuai; Yang, Jin; Tyagi, Mayank; Zhou, Xu; Hou, Xinxin; Cao, Bohan",10.1016/j.psep.2020.08.012,journalArticle,6L8X5BHR,2021,,1

Hybrid deep collaborative filtering for job recommendation,NO,,,,"In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in a series of areas, but there is few published work on deep learning for job recommendation. Most researchers focus on the application of traditional algorithms, most of which still use algorithms like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. In this paper, we study and improve the existing recommender algorithm based on deep learning and apply it to the field of job recommendation, hoping to solve the problems existing in traditional recommender algorithm. We collect the information of the candidate and the job from a human resources business system, then performed pre-processing operations on collected data, such as data cleaning, data transforming and data reduction, and obtain a human resources data warehouse for job recommender algorithm. In addition, we propose Hybrid Deep Collaborative Filtering (HDCF) algorithm based on Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL) algorithm. With the help of the feature extraction ability of deep learning, HDCF overcomes the shortcomings of traditional collaborative filtering algorithms when dealing with sparse data and cold-start items. Experimental results show that HDCF has better recommendation performance than traditional recommender algorithms such as Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF).",W.

Unification of Machine Learning Features,not sure,,,,"In the Information Age, Machine learning (ML) provides a competitive advantage to any business. Machine learning applications are not limited to driverless cars or online recommendations but are widely used in healthcare, social services, government systems, telecommunications, and so on. As many enterprises are trying to step up machine learning applications, it is critical to have a long-term strategy. Most of the enterprises are not able to truly realize the fruits of ML capabilities due to its complexity. It is easier to access a variety of data today due to data democratization, distributed storage, technological advancements, and big data applications. Despite easier data access and recent advancements in ML, developers still spend most of the time in data cleansing, data preparation, and data modeling for ML applications. These steps are often repeated and result in identical features. As identical features can have inconsistent processing while testing and training, more issues pop up at later stages in ML application development. The unification of ML features is an effective way to address these issues. This paper presents details about numerous methods to achieve ML features unification.  2020 IEEE.","Patel, Jayesh",10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.00-93,conferencePaper,I33WY4EF,2020,,1
An Approach Based on Fog Computing for Providing Reliability in IoT Data Collection: A Case Study in a Colombian Coffee Smart Farm,NO,,,,"The reliability in data collection is essential in Smart Farming supported by the Internet of Things (IoT). Several IoT and Fog-based works consider the reliability concept, but they fall short in providing a network's edge mechanisms for detecting and replacing outliers. Making decisions based on inaccurate data can diminish the quality of crops and, consequently, lose money. This paper proposes an approach for providing reliable data collection, which focuses on outlier detection and treatment in IoT-based Smart Farming. Our proposal includes an architecture based on the continuum IoT-Fog-Cloud, which incorporates a mechanism based on Machine Learning to detect outliers and another based on interpolation for inferring data intended to replace outliers. We located the data cleaning at the Fog to Smart Farming applications functioning in the farm operate with reliable data. We evaluate our approach by carrying out a case study in a network based on the proposed architecture and deployed at a Colombian Coffee Smart Farm. Results show our mechanisms achieve high Accuracy, Precision, and Recall as well as low False Alarm Rate and Root Mean Squared Error when detecting and replacing outliers with inferred data. Considering the obtained results, we conclude that our approach provides reliable data collection in Smart Farming.","Montoya-Munoz, AI; Rendon, OMC",10.3390/app10248904,journalArticle,TTPLC4FW,2020,,1

Cleaning Matters! Preprocessing-enhanced Anomaly Detection and Classification in Mobile Networks,Specific,,,,"Mobile communications providers often monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) with the goal of identifying anomalous operation scenarios that can affect the quality of Internet-based services. In this regard, anomaly detection and classification in mobile networks has become a challenging task due to the unknown distributions exhibited by the collected data and the lack of interpretability of the embedded (machine learning) models. This paper proposes an unsupervised end-to-end methodology based on both a data cleaning strategy and explainable machine learning models to detect and classify performance anomalies in mobile networks. The proposed approach, dubbed clean and explainable anomaly detection and classification (KLNX), aims at identifying attributes and operation scenarios that could induce anomalous KPI values without resorting to parameter tuning. Unlike previous methodologies, the proposed method includes a data cleaning stage that extracts and removes experiments and attributes considered outliers in order to train the anomaly detection engine with the cleanest possible dataset. Additionally, machine learning models provide interpretable information about features and boundaries describing both the normal network behavior and the anomalous scenarios. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a testbed generating synthetic data is developed using a known TCP throughput model. Finally, the methodology is assessed on a real data set captured by operational tests in commercial networks.","Ramirez, J.M.; Rojo, P.; Diez, F.; Mancuso, V.; Fernandez Anta, A.",10.1109/MedComNet55087.2022.9810378,conferencePaper,IZB9W2YD,2022,,1

Extracting statistically significant behaviour from fish tracking data with and without large dataset cleaning,NO,,,,"Extracting a statistically significant result from video of natural phenomenon can be difficult for two reasons: (i) there can be considerable natural variation in the observed behaviour and (ii) computer vision algorithms applied to natural phenomena may not perform correctly on a significant number of samples. This study presents one approach to clean a large noisy visual tracking dataset to allow extracting statistically sound results from the image data. In particular, analyses of 3.6 million underwater trajectories of a fish with the water temperature at the time of acquisition are presented. Although there are many false detections and incorrect trajectory assignments, by a combination of data binning and robust estimation methods, reliable evidence for an increase in fish speed as water temperature increases are demonstrated. Then, a method for data cleaning which removes outliers arising from false detections and incorrect trajectory assignments using a deep learning-based clustering algorithm is proposed. The corresponding results show a rise in fish speed as temperature goes up. Several statistical tests applied to both cleaned and not-cleaned data confirm that both results are statistically significant and show an increasing trend. However, the latter approach also generates a cleaner dataset suitable for other analysis.","Beyan, C; Katsageorgiou, VM; Fisher, RB",10.1049/iet-cvi.2016.0462,journalArticle,D26FBE2V,2018,,1

Complaint-Driven Training Data Debugging at Interactive Speeds,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Modern databases support queries that perform model inference (inference queries). Although powerful and widely used, inference queries are susceptible to incorrect results if the model is biased due to training data errors. Recently, prior work Rain proposed complaint-driven data debugging which uses user-specified errors in the output of inference queries (Complaints) to rank erroneous training examples that most likely caused the complaint. This can help users better interpret results and debug training sets. Rain combined influence analysis from the ML literature with relaxed query provenance polynomials from the DB literature to approximate the derivative of complaints w.r.t. training examples. Although effective, the runtime is O(|T|d), where T and d are the training set and model sizes, due to its reliance on the model's second order derivatives (the Hessian). On a Wide Resnet Network (WRN) model with 1.5 million parameters, it takes 1 minute to debug a complaint. We observe that most complaint debugging costs are independent of the complaint, and that modern models are overparameterized. In response, Rain++ uses precomputation techniques, based on non-trivial insights unique to data debugging, to reduce debugging latencies to a constant factor independent of model size. We also develop optimizations when the queried database is known apriori, and for standing queries over streaming databases. Combining these optimizations in Rain++ ensures interactive debugging latencies (1ms) on models with millions of parameters.  2022 ACM.","Flokas, Lampros; Wu, Weiyuan; Liu, Yejia; Wang, Jiannan; Verma, Nakul; Wu, Eugene",10.1145/3514221.3517849,conferencePaper,X8C6K9G7,2022,aug,1
Robust weighted regression via PAELLA sample weights,NO,,,,"This paper reports the usage of the occurrence vector provided by the PAELLA algorithm in the context of robust regression. PAELLA was originally conceived as an outlier detection and data cleaning technique. A novel approach is to use this algorithm not for discarding outliers but to generate information related to the reliability of the observations recorded in the dataset. This approach proves to provide successful results when compared to traditional common practice such as outlier removal. A set of experiments using a contrived difficult artificial dataset are described using both neural networks and classical polynomial fitting. Finally, a successful comparison of our approach to two state-of-the-art algorithms proves the benefits of using the PAELLA algorithm in the context of robust regression.","Castejón-Limas, Manuel; Alaiz-Moreton, Hector; Fernández-Robles, Laura; Alfonso-Cendón, Javier; Fernández-Llamas, Camino; Sánchez-González, Lidia; Pérez, Hilde",10.1016/j.neucom.2019.03.108,journalArticle,J4Y2SFIG,2020,,1
Data abnormal detection using bidirectional long-short neural network combined with artificial experience,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Data anomalies seriously threaten the reliability of the bridge structural health monitoring system and may trigger system misjudgment. To overcome the above problem, an efficient and accurate data anomaly detection method is desiderated. Traditional anomaly detection methods extract various abnormal features as the key indicators to identify data anomalies. Then set thresholds artificially for various features to identify specific anomalies, which is the artificial experience method. However, limited by the poor generalization ability among sensors, this method often leads to high labor costs. Another approach to anomaly detection is a data-driven approach based on machine learning methods. Among these, the bidirectional long-short memory neural network (BiLSTM), as an effective classification method, excels at finding complex relationships in multivariate time series data. However, training unprocessed original signals often leads to low computation efficiency and poor convergence, for lacking appropriate feature selection. Therefore, this article combines the advantages of the two methods by proposing a deep learning method with manual experience statistical features fed into it. Experimental comparative studies illustrate that the BiLSTM model with appropriate feature input has an accuracy rate of over 87-94%. Meanwhile, this paper provides basic principles of data cleaning and discusses the typical features of various anomalies. Furthermore, the optimization strategies of the feature space selection based on artificial experience are also highlighted.

Spatial and temporal trends reveal: hotspot identification of crimes using machine learning approach,NO,,,,"With the escalation in criminal cases, most of the population all over the country are becoming victims of different types of crime, which is one of the major concerns in the evolution of society. Therefore, hotspot identification of crimes by analysing real-time dataset has become essential and will significantly benefit the public by accurately analysing the dangerous locations. This paper aims to develop the framework model for identifying criminal hotspots using a modified K-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm by considering different crime characteristics like the severity of the crime, frequency of crime and temporal data of crime by visualising hotspots using geographic information system (GIS). This study analyses the real dataset of crime for the recent five years collected from the Commissioner of Police of Gurgaon, Haryana. The data cleaning and pre-processing strategies have been applied to make data ready for further training the model. The results demonstrate locations of the different hotspots based on the density of crime occurrences, and accurate visualisation of hotspots using GIS display is done by supervised learning and unsupervised classifiers.

An ensemble machine learning model for the prediction of danger zones: Towards a global counter-terrorism,NO,,,,"Terrorism can be described as the use of violence against persons or properties to intimidate or coerce a government or its citizens to some certain political or social objectives. It is a global problem which has led to loss of lives and properties and known to have negative impacts on tourism and global economy. Terrorism has also been associated with high level of insecurity and most nations of the world are interested in any research efforts that can reduce its menace. Most of the research efforts on terrorism have focused on measures to fight terrorism or how to reduce the activities of terrorists but there are limited efforts on terrorism prediction. The aim of this work is to develop an ensemble machine learning model which combines Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor for prediction of continents susceptible to terrorism. Data was obtained from Global Terrorism Database and data preprocessing included data cleaning and dimensionality reduction. Two feature selection techniques, Chi-squared, Information Gain and a hybrid of both were applied to the dataset before modeling. Ensemble machine learning models were then constructed and applied on the selected features. Chi-squared, Information Gain and the hybrid-based features produced an accuracy of 94.17%, 97.34% and 97.81% respectively at predicting danger zones with respective sensitivity scores of 82.3%, 88.7% and 92.2% and specificity scores of 98%, 90.5% and 99.67% respectively.

"Response Simulation, Data Cleansing and Restoration of Dynamic and Static Measurements Based on Deep Learning Algorithms",NO,,,,"In this study, an output-based neuro controller was built based on the idea of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and its capabilities in response simulation, data cleansing and restoration capability were verified using measurement data from actual structural testing. The ANFIS is a family of the deep learning algorithm, which incorporates the benefits of adaptive control technique, artificial neural network, and the fuzzy inference system. Thus, it is expected to produce very accurate predictions even for the highly nonlinear system. Forced vibration responses of a five-story steel building were simulated by ANFIS and its accuracy was compared with the results of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is a type of traditional artificial neural networks. Simulations by ANFIS were very accurate with a much lower root means square error (RMSE) than RNN. Simulated data by ANFIS showed an almost perfect match with the original. Even the small ripples in the power spectrum plot outside the dominant frequency were successfully reproduced. In addition, the ANFIS was used to increase the sampling rate of dynamic data. It was shown that missing high-frequency contents could be successfully reproduced when the ANFIS was properly trained. Lastly, The ANFIS was applied to remove the noise in the measured data from RC column cyclic load tests. The outliers were corrected effectively, but the tendency of flattening the peak values was observed.  2018, The Author(s).","Heo, Seok-Jae; Chunwei, Zhang; Yu, Eunjong",10.1186/s40069-018-0316-x,journalArticle,RJEBNDTR,2018,,1

Error Detection in pMU Voltage Measurements Using Artificial Neural Network,NO,,,,"Micro Phasor measurement unit ($\mu\text{PMU}$) is a new technology used for monitoring distribution grid. It monitors voltage and current phasors of some buses and calculates voltage and current phasors of the other buses. At present, there is a two-ways energy flow in electric distribution grids due to the growth of distributed energy resources. So, there are many sources of error in $\mu\text{PMU}$ system data. In this paper, Pearson correlation is used with the help of a Binary Neural Network (BNN) classifier to detect the errors in $\mu\text{PMU}$ voltage measurements. Two BNNs are used in this paper. The first BNN is used to detect the injected error in the measured voltage magnitude. Meanwhile, the second BNN is used to detect the injected error in the measured voltage phase angle. The row sum of the correlation matrix is used as an input to BNN that indicates the weight of relation between a group of voltage measurements. The proposed method is tested for Assiut-university radial sub-feeder and the results showed a robust and an accurate performance for errors detection in $\mu\text{PMU}$ voltage measurements.  2021 IEEE.","Merazy, Mostafa A.; Hasan, Rahma; Mohamed, Mansour A.; Nayel, M.",10.1109/MEPCON50283.2021.9686200,conferencePaper,LNE8X3HX,2021,,1

Detection of cleaning interventions on photovoltaic modules with machine learning,NO,,,,"Soiling losses are a major concern for remote power systems that rely on photovoltaic energy. Power loss analysis is efficient for the monitoring of large power plants and for developing an optimal cleaning schedule, but it is not adapted for remote monitoring of standalone photovoltaic systems that are used in rural and poor regions. Indeed, this technique relies on a costly and dirt sensitive irradiance sensor. This paper investigates the possibility of a low-cost monitoring of cleaning interventions on photovoltaic modules during daytime. We believe that it can be helpful to know whether the soiling is regularly removed or not, and to decide if it is necessary to carry out additional cleaning operations. The problem is formulated as a classification task to automatically identify the occurrence of a cleaning intervention using a time window of temperature, voltage and current measurements of a photovoltaic array. We investigate machine learning tools based on Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest to achieve such classification task. In addition, we study the influence of the temporal resolution of the signals and the feature extraction on the classification performance. The experiments are conducted on a real dataset and show promising results with classification accuracy of up to 95%. Based on the results, three implementation strategies addressing different practical needs are proposed. The results may be particularly useful for non-governmental organizations, governments and energy service companies to improve the maintenance level of their photovoltaic facilities.  2020 Elsevier Ltd","Heinrich, Matthias; Meunier, Simon; Same, Allou; Queval, Loic; Darga, Arouna; Oukhellou, Latifa; Multon, Bernard",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114642,journalArticle,YYCQER7D,2020,,1

Quality control of online monitoring data of air pollutants using artificial neural networks,NO,,,,"The intensive monitoring of air pollutants has led to the acquisition of vast quantities of data. Traditional quality control methods based on existing knowledge may be inefficient because of our limited understanding regarding the interaction of human activities and stochastic environmental factors. Moreover, traditional methods for outlier detection may be misleading because of the existence of valid outliers and invalid inliers. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are developed to identify instrument failure based on current and historical observations. Two structures, i.e., multilayer perceptrons and recurrent networks, are trained using 50,000 hourly data points labeled by human reviewers. The most conservative model identified 57.5% of the invalid sulfur compound observations and 44.9% of the invalid nitrogen compound observations. By setting a more liberal threshold, these values increased to 76.0% and 79.7%, respectively. Except for SO2, the ANNs outperformed the traditional methods for data quality control, as demonstrated with a plausibility test, a test of temporal consistency and a residential analysis. Compared with the test of temporal consistency, which was the most effective traditional method studied, the true positive rates of the ANNs were 19.4% to 29.5% higher for all pollutants except SO2, given the same false positive rates. The results indicate the effectiveness of ANNs for data quality control even without supplementary information. Methods for performance improvement are discussed.","Wang, ZY; Feng, JJ; Fu, QY; Gao, S; Chen, XJ; Cheng, JP",10.1007/s11869-019-00734-4,journalArticle,AF3YDYLJ,2019,,1

Traffic sign classification via Semi-Supervised model with uncertain labels,NO,,,,"Traffic sign classification is the core of intelligent transportation and fundamental for constructing an automatic driving system. While supervised classification tasks demonstrate promising classification performance, a particular challenge is how to ensure the confidence for collecting labelled data. This paper presents a semi-supervised approach via label confidence for traffic sign classification to avoid the interference of uncertain labelled data. The idea of the proposed approach is to compare unsupervised information of the data, the supervised information carried by the learning data, and the supervised information which is given by the classification model in order to detect inconsistencies. The approach is able to build a robust classification model. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing approaches when uncertain labelled data exists.",L. Yang; Q. Liu; Y.

The similarity of remote sensing data records is calculated, and the similar and repeated remote sensing data records are removed by sorting and merging. According to the theory of evidence and the relevant evidence synthesis method, the marine remote sensing data of GIS is applied to neural network classifier, and the classification is performed based on the results. The experimental results show that this method has the advantages of good performance, high classification accuracy, high recall rate, and high data-cleaning precision.","Zheng, YR; Zhang, LM; Yang, B; Zhang, GH; Liu, TM; Liu, S",10.2112/JCR-S1108-013.1,journalArticle,ILWWAXYL,2020,,1

Real-world knowledge extraction via disentangled variational autoencoders for photon diagnostics,NO,,,,"We present a real-world application of data processing with neural networks by deploying the use of disentangled variational autoencoders on measured electron time-of-flight data of a diagnostic instrument for online wavelength monitoring at the free electron laser FLASH in Hamburg. Without a-priori knowledge the network is able to find representations of single-shot FEL spectra, which have a low signal-to-noise ratio, that reveal in a directly human-interpretable way crucial information about the photon properties. The central photon energy and the intensity as well as very detector-specific features are identified. The network is also capable of data cleaning, i.e. denoising as well as removal of artefacts. In the reconstruction, this allows for identification of signatures with very low intensity which are hardly recognisable in the raw data. In the present case the network enhances the quality of the diagnostic analysis at FLASH, though it has the potential to improve the analysis of similar kind of spectroscopy data.

Joint multi-field siamese recurrent neural network for entity resolution,YES,ML4DC,?,el,"Entity resolution which deals with determining whether two records refer to the same entity has a wide range of applications in both data cleaning and integration. Traditional approaches focus on using string metrics to calculate the matching scores of recorded pairs or employing the machine learning technique with hand-crafted features. However, the effectiveness of these methods largely depends on designing good domain-specific metric methods or extracting discriminative features with rich domain knowledge. Also, traditional learning-based methods usually ignore the discrepancy between citations fields. In this paper, to decrease the impact of information gaps between different fields and fully take advantage of semantical and contextual information in each field, we present a novel joint multi-field siamese recurrent architecture. In particular, our method employs word-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for the fields with the strong relevance between each word and character-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the fields with the weak relevance between each word, which can exploit each fields temporal information effectively. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our model can learn discriminative features and outperforms several baseline methods and other RNN-based methods.

Age-Net: An MRI-Based Iterative Framework for Brain Biological Age Estimation,NO,,,,"The concept of biological age (BA) - although important in clinical practice - is hard to grasp mainly due to the lack of a clearly defined reference standard. For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. In this initial study we focus mainly on brain MRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing state-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging patients (BA \not ≈ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that the remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients.

Time series data cleaning: From anomaly detection to anomaly repairing (technical report),YES,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,features,"Errors are prevalent in time series data, such as GPS trajectories or sensor readings. Existing methods focus more on anomaly detection but not on repairing the detected anomalies. By simply filtering out the dirty data via anomaly detection, applications could still be unreliable over the incomplete time series. Instead of simply discarding anomalies, we propose to (iteratively) repair them in time series data, by creatively bonding the beauty of temporal nature in anomaly detection with the widely considered minimum change principle in data repairing. Our major contributions include: (1) a novel framework of iterative minimum repairing (IMR) over time series data, (2) explicit analysis on convergence of the proposed iterative minimum repairing, and (3) efficient estimation of parameters in each iteration. Remarkably, with incremental computation, we reduce the complexity of parameter estimation from O(n) to O(1). Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposal compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we show that (the proposed) repairing indeed improves the time series classification application. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Although these methods can solve some problems, there still are computational difficulties, lack of sufficient knowledge, and other limitations. In recent years, with the rise of the crowdsourcing, more and more research has introduced crowdsourcing into the process of data cleaning, providing the extra knowledge needed for machine learning. Since workers on the crowdsourcing platforms require to be paid, it is essential to study how to effectively combine machine learning algorithms with crowdsourcing on a limited budget. This study proposes two active learning models to support crowdsourcing-enhanced data cleaning. By using active learning technology to reduce crowdsourcing cost, data cleaning based on real crowdsourcing platform is realized for given data sets, which can reduce cost and improve data quality at the same time. Experimental results on the real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.  Copyright 2020, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Designing the ai developing system through ecological interface design,NO,,,,"In recent years, several kinds of machine learning tools have developed, each involving complex functions and tasks, which means usage knowledge varies between tools. Integrating the environment for effective AI machine learning can be regarded as a complicated task and may even consist of several separate tasks, such as building a test environment, data acquisition, data cleansing, machine learning training, and model management. In terms of the cognitive engineering approach, most tasks not only require knowledge-based cognitive control over skill-based or rule-based behaviours higher cognitive loads and workloads as well. Since complex knowledge and higher cognitive loads are required, the use of AI machine learning is limited and leads to ineffective work procedures. Thus, this research analysed the AI development process via various methods of cognitive task analysis in order to identify which tasks induce cognitive workload. Then, a new integrated AI development system was created, which was expected to reduce the number of ineffective tasks and workload. Experiments were conducted twice to validate the systems effectiveness, and the results indicate that there were significant differences between the several different AI development tasks.

Comparing Classifiers for the Prediction of the Stenosis of Coronary Artery,NO,,,,"Myocardial Ischemia is the main cause of mortality in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). One of the methods used in screening patients with this disease is the diag-nosis of radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI). In this paper, we conducted a comparative study by experimenting on several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc., to classify the stenosis of coronary artery. High-level features from rMPI computed by 4D-MSPECT polar map were used to train/test the models. rMPI features of the risk group of CAD patients were obtained from a public hospital. With the hypothesis that patient characteristics (e.g., Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia) could improve the prediction performance of the models, this study also included patient characteristics in our experimentation as important parts of feature selection. All other processes (i.e., data cleaning, feature selection, feature engineering and feature transformation) in machine learning pipeline were also deliberately experimented in this study.

A Method for Resume Information Extraction Using BERT-BiLSTM-CRF,NO,,,,"To solve the problem of low efficiency of electronic resume information extraction by artificial construction rules, a resume information extraction method based on named entity recognition is proposed, which extracted personal details such as graduation college, job intention and job skills from the resume into named entity recognition. Firstly, the TXT text in different formats of resume file is extracted for data cleaning and other preprocessing. The BERT language model based on multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to extract text features and obtain word granularity vector matrix. The BiLSTM neural network is used to obtain the context abstraction features of serialized text. Finally, using CRF to decode and annotate the global optimal sequence, the corresponding resume entity information is extracted. Experimental results show that the whole scheme can effectively extract electronic resume information, and the performance of the resume information extraction model based on BERT-BiLSTM-CRF is better than other models.  2021 IEEE.","Li, Xiaowei; Shu, Hui; Zhai, Yi; Lin, Zhiqiang",10.1109/ICCT52962.2021.9657937,conferencePaper,RCD6QKYW,2021,,1
Effect of Manual Data Cleaning on Nutrient Intakes Using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24),NO,,,,"Background: Automated dietary assessment tools such as ASA24 (R) are useful for collecting 24-hour recall data in large-scale studies. Modifications made during manual data cleaning may affect nutrient intakes. Objectives: We evaluated the effects of modifications made during manual data cleaning on nutrient intakes of interest: energy, carbohydrate, total fat, protein, and fiber. Methods: Differences in mean intake before and after data cleaning modifications for all recalls and average intakes per subject were analyzed by paired t-tests. The Chi-squared test was used to determine whether unsupervised recalls had more open-ended text responses that required modification than supervised recalls. We characterized food types of text response modifications. Correlations between predictive energy requirements, measured total energy expenditure (TEE), and mean energy intake from raw and modified data were examined. Results: After excluding 11 recalls with invalidating technical errors, 1499 valid recalls completed by 393 subjects were included in this analysis. We found significant differences before and after modifications for energy, carbohydrate, total fat, and protein intakes for all recalls (P < 0.05). Limiting to modified recalls, there were significant differences for all nutrients of interest, including fiber (P < 0.02). There was not a significantly greater proportion of text responses requiring modification for home compared with supervised recalls (P = 0.271). Predicted energy requirements correlated highly with TEE. There was no significant difference in correlation of mean energy intake with TEE for modified compared with raw data. Mean intake for individual subjects was significantly different for energy, protein, and fat intakes following cleaning modifications (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Manual modifications can change mean nutrient intakes for an entire cohort and individuals. However, modifications did not significantly affect the correlation of energy intake with predictive requirements and measured expenditure. Investigators can consider their research question and nutrients of interest when deciding to make cleaning modifications.","Bouzid, YY; Arsenault, JE; Bonnel, EL; Cervantes, E; Kan, AN; Keim, NL; Lemay, DG; Stephensen, CB",10.1093/cdn/nzab005,journalArticle,TYAFNCZH,2021,,1

A Novel approach for classifying diabetes' patients based on imputation and machine learning,NO,,,,"Since the last decade, many research studies has been conducted on machine learning-based diabetes disease prediction using diagnostic measurement. However, the main challenge in machine learning-based diabetes disease prediction is the preprocessing of data, which contains, in most cases missing values and outliers. For data analytics and accurate prediction, data cleansing is highly desired and recommended. The goal of this study is to predict diabetic patients using realworld datasets. The proposed approach is based on three main steps: cleansing, modelling, and storytelling. In the first step, an imputation process is conducted to remove missing values. Then, k-nearest neighbor's algorithm is applied to classify patients. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, two criteria, namely the F1 score and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) has been used.

The complicated production process of steel products makes it difficult to find the causes of surplus materials. In this work, we propose a surplus material prediction problem and solve it based on statistical analysis and machine learning methods. In the concerned problem, we predict whether there are surplus materials under a given group of production parameters. The dataset used in this work is from a real-world three-month steel coil production process. First, data cleaning is conducted to standardize the industrial dataset. Then, the production parameters highly correlated with surplus material prediction results are selected by a series of feature selection methods. Finally, two prediction models based on extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression are presented according to the selected features. The experimental results reveal that the proposed prediction models have similar effectiveness.

Deep learning framework for classification of emoji based sentiments,NO,,,,"Recent patterns of human sentiments are highly influenced by emoji based sentiments (EBS). Social media users are widely using emoji based sentiments (EBS) in between text messages, tweets and posts. Although tiny pictures of emoji contains sufficient information to be considered for construction of classification model; but due to the wide range of dissimilar, heterogynous and complex patterns of emoji with similarmeanings (SM) have become one of the significant research areas of machine vision. This paper proposes an approach to provide meticulous assistance to social media application (SMA) users to classify the EBS sentiments. Proposed methodology consists upon three layerswhere first layer deals with data cleaning and feature selection techniques to detect dissimilar emoji patterns (DEP) with similar meanings (SM). In first sub step we input set of emoji, in second sub step every emoji has to qualify user defined threshold, in third sub step algorithm detects every emoji by considering as objects and in fourth step emoji images are cropped, after data cleaning these tiny images are saved as emoji images. In second step we build classification model by using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to explore hidden knowledge of emoji datasets. In third step we present results visualization by using confusion matrix and other estimations.

SAR tomography based on deep learning,NO,,,,"In this paper, the potential of a deep learning approach for SAR tomography (TomoSAR) is investigated. TomoSAR is a powerful technique that allows the 3D reconstruction of objects lying on the Earth surface, by separating multiple scatterers with different elevations laying in the same range-azimuth resolution cell. In urban applications, the number of interfering scatterers is typically very small, so that the reconstruction of the elevation reflectivity profile can be faced as a statistical detection problem. Detection performance depends on how well the adopted statistical model fits to the observed scene. For complex urban scenarios this issue can greatly impair achievable accuracy of results. Then, we propose to exploit the neural networks' capabilities to learn the data generative model, in order to face the problem of signal model inaccuracies. In particular, in the assumption of a single scatterer, a neural network can be trained to solve a simple classification problem.

ADME prediction with KNIME: In silico aqueous solubility consensus model based on supervised recursive random forest approaches,NO,,,,"In-silico prediction of aqueous solubility plays an important role during the drug discovery and development processes. For many years, the limited performance of in-silico solubility models has been attributed to the lack of high-quality solubility data for pharmaceutical molecules. However, some studies suggest that the poor accuracy of solubility prediction is not related to the quality of the experimental data and that more precise methodologies (algorithms and/or set of descriptors) are required for predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules. In this study a large and diverse database was generated with aqueous solubility values collected from two public sources; two new recursive machine-learning approaches were developed for data cleaning and variable selection, and a consensus model based on regression and classification algorithms was created. The modeling protocol, which includes the curation of chemical and experimental data, was implemented in KNIME, with the aim of obtaining an automated workflow for the prediction of new databases. Finally, we compared several methods or models available in the literature with our consensus model, showing results comparable or even outperforming previous published models.","Falcon-Cano, G; Molina, C; Cabrera-Perez, MA",10.5599/admet.852,journalArticle,4WNCNQHH,2020,,1
State of Industry 5.0-Analysis and Identification of Current Research Trends,NO,,,,"The term Industry 4.0, coined to be the fourth industrial revolution, refers to a higher level of automation for operational productivity and efficiency by connecting virtual and physical worlds in an industry. With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword ""Industry 5.0"" search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years.","Akundi, A; Euresti, D; Luna, S; Ankobiah, W; Lopes, A; Edinbarough, I",10.3390/asi5010027,journalArticle,E44HFAC4,2022,,1
A two-stage data cleansing method for bridge global positioning system monitoring data based on bi-direction long and short term memory anomaly identification and conditional generative adversarial networks data repair,NO,,,,"Data cleansing is an essential approach for improving data quality. Therefore, it is the key to avoiding the false alarm of the monitoring system due to the anomaly of the data itself. Data cleansing consists of two parts: anomaly identification and anomaly repair. However, current research on data cleansing has mainly focused on anomaly identification and lacks efficient data repair methods. The key to data repair lies in sensor correlation models based on mapping relationships between sensors. To obtain a good inter-sensor relationship model, it is first necessary to exclude anomalous data from the training data set used for modeling. Therefore, a two-stage data cleansing framework for collaborative multi-sensor repair is proposed. First, based on the analysis of anomalous features of GPS data, a bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network model is adopted for data anomalies classification and localization. As a result, the data segment to be repaired is determined. Then, on the basis of all sensor data in the time range of the day before the target repair data segment, the data set for data repair is constructed by excluding the anomaly data segments in the data set with the help of the above anomaly identification results. Then, a conditional generation adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed to achieve data repair. Experimental validation shows that the two-stage data cleansing method of identification followed by repair can accurately identify and repair GPS anomalies. Finally, several factors affecting the repair effect are discussed. 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Yang, Kang; Ding, Youliang; Jiang, Huachen; Zhao, Hanwei; Luo, Gan",10.1002/stc.2993,journalArticle,TUVEQ7H6,2022,,1

Mineral grains recognition using computer vision and machine learning,NO,,,,"Identifying and counting individual mineral grains composing sand is an important component of many studies in environment, engineering, mineral exploration, ore processing and the foundation of geometallurgy. Typically, silt (32128m) and sand (1281000m) sized grains will be characterized under an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope. In both cases, it is a tedious and costly process. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an original computational approach in order to automate mineral grains recognition from numerical images obtained with a simple optical microscope. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the current computer vision based on machine learning algorithms is tested for the automated recognition of such mineral grains. In more details, this work uses the simple linear iterative clustering segmentation to generate superpixels and many of them allow isolating sand grains, which is not possible with classical segmentation methods. Also, the approach has been tested using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNNs did not give as good results as the superpixels method. The superpixels are also exploited to extract features related to a sand grain. These image characteristics form the raw dataset. Prior to proceed with the classification, a data cleaning stage is necessary to get a usable dataset for machine learning algorithms. In addition, we present a comparison of performances of several algorithms. The overall obtained results are approximately 90% and demonstrate the concept of mineral recognition from a sample of sand grains provided by a numerical image.  2019 The Authors","Maitre, Julien; Bouchard, Kevin; Bedard, L.

Cleansing and imputation of body mass index data and its impact on a machine learning based prediction model,NO,,,,"Background: A challenge of using electronic health records for secondary analyses is data quality. Body mass index (BMI) is an important predictor for various diseases but often not documented properly. Objectives: The aim of our study is to perform data cleansing on BMI values and to find the best method for an imputation of missing values in order to increase data quality. Further, we want to assess the effect of changes in data quality on the performance of a prediction model based on machine learning. Methods: After data cleansing on BMI data, we compared machine learning methods and statistical methods in their accuracy of imputed values using the root mean square error. In a second step, we used three variations of BMI data as a training set for a model predicting the occurrence of delirium. Results: Neural network and linear regression models performed best for imputation. There were no changes in model performance for different BMI input data. Conclusion: Although data quality issues may lead to biases, it does not always affect performance of secondary analyses.  2018 The authors and IOS Press.","Jauk, Stefanie; Kramer, Diether; Leodolter, Werner",10.3233/978-1-61499-858-7-116,conferencePaper,YZXJFPJK,2018,,1

Blockchain-Based Task Offloading for Edge Computing on Low-Quality Data via Distributed Learning in the Internet of Energy,NO,,,,"With the development of the Internet of energy, more and more participants share data by different types of edge devices. However, such multi-source heterogenous data typically contain low-quality data, e.g., missing values, which may result in potential risks. Besides, resource-constrained devices incur large latency in edge computing networks. To alleviate such latency, distributed task offloading schemes are designed to share the computation burden between edge nodes and nearby servers. However, there are three main drawbacks of such schemes. First, low-quality data are not carefully evaluated by constraints under scenarios, which may result in slow convergence in distributed computation. Second, multi-source data including sensitive information are computed and shared among edge nodes without privacy protection. Third, distributed tasks on low-quality data may result in low-quality results even with an optimal offloading scheme. To address the problems above, a task offloading framework for edge computing based on consortium blockchain and distributed reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper, which can provide high-quality task offloading policies with data privacy protected. This framework consists of three key components: data quality evaluation (DQ) with multiple data quality dimensions, data repairing (DR) with a repairing algorithm based on a novel repairing consensus mechanism and distributed reinforcement learning for task arrangement (DELTA) with a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm based on a novel low-quality data distributing strategy. Numeric results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed task offloading framework for edge computing on low-quality data in the IoE.  1983-2012 IEEE.","Liu, Yongnan; Guan, Xin; Peng, Yu; Chen, Hongyang; Ohtsuki, Tomoaki; Han, Zhu",10.1109/JSAC.2021.3118417,journalArticle,XPB4D446,2022,,1
Travel mode detection method based on big smartphone global positioning system tracking data,NO,,,,"This article proposes a machine learning-based travel mode detection method using urban residents' travel routes as the data source, collected via smartphone global positioning system modules. A data-driven machine learning strategy was chosen in the model construction. This study performed data cleaning and mining on over 4400 pieces of urban resident travel records containing several millions of global positioning system tracking points. Series of characteristic values of speed, travel distance, and direction are calculated, which reflect the travel mode of smartphone holders. In travel mode identification, first, the transition regions of travel segments of different travel modes are effectively distinguished; then, continuous tracking points for single-mode travel are connected into single-mode travel segments. The travel mode of the surveyed subjects is identified based on the calculated features of average speed, average acceleration, and average change of direction within each single-mode segment. The random forest method is chosen as the basis model to classify travel mode. Three-quarters of the travel records were used to construct the random forest classifier, and the detection accuracy of the established model for the remaining 1/4 of the travel record reached 94.4%. The proposed method uses massive smartphone global positioning system tracking points as the basis; the detection results are consistent with manually collected prompted recall survey records.","Zhou, CR; Jia, HF; Gao, JX; Yang, LL; Feng, YX; Tian, GD",10.1177/1687814017708134,journalArticle,6SRZ6LB8,2017,,1
Performance analysis of machine learning algorithms for missing value imputation,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"Data mining requires a pre-processing task in which the data are prepared, cleaned, integrated, transformed, reduced and discretized for ensuring the quality. Missing values is a universal problem in many research domains that is commonly encountered in the data cleaning process. Missing values usually occur when a value of stored data absent for a variable of an observation. Missing values problem imposes undesirable effect on analysis results, especially when it leads to biased parameter estimates. Data imputation is a common way to deal with missing values where the missing value's substitutes are discovered through statistical or machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, examining the strengths (and limitations) of these techniques is important to aid understanding its characteristics. In this paper, the performance of three machine learning classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Bayesian Networks) are compared in terms of data imputation accuracy. The results shows that among the three classifiers, Bayesian has the most promising performance.","Abidin, N.Z.; Ismail, A.R.",,journalArticle,AMPP66IC,2018,aug,1

Efficient and Effective 4D Trajectory Data Cleansing,Specific,,,,"As the rapid development of aviation industry and newly emerging crowd-sourcing projects such as Flightradar24 and FlightAware, large amount of air traffic data, particularly four-dimension (4D) trajectory data, have become available for the public. In order to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of results, data cleansing is the first step in analyzing 4D trajectory data, including error identification and mitigation. Data cleansing techniques for the 4D trajectory data are investigated. Back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is applied to repair errors. Newton interpolation method is used to obtain even-spaced trajectory samples over a uniform distribution of each flight's 4D trajectory data. Furthermore, a new method is proposed to compress data while maintaining the intrinsic characteristics of the trajectories. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is applied to identify remaining outliers of sample points. Experiments are performed on a data set of one-day 4D trajectory data over Europe. The results show that the proposed method can achieve more efficient and effective results than the existing approaches. The work contributes to the first step of data preprocessing and lays foundation for further downstream 4D trajectory analysis.  2020, Editorial Department of Transactions of NUAA.

Crowdsourcing the character of a place: Character-level convolutional networks for multilingual geographic text classification,NO,,,,"This article presents a new character-level convolutional neural network model that can classify multilingual text written using any character set that can be encoded with UTF-8, a standard and widely used 8-bit character encoding. For geographic classification of text, we demonstrate that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art word-based text classification methods. The model was tested on four crowdsourced data sets made up of Wikipedia articles, online travel blogs, Geonames toponyms, and Twitter posts. Unlike word-based methods, which require data cleaning and pre-processing, the proposed model works for any language without modification and with classification accuracy comparable to existing methods. Using a synthetic data set with introduced character-level errors, we show it is more robust to noise than word-level classification algorithms. The results indicate that UTF-8 character-level convolutional neural networks are a promising technique for georeferencing noisy text, such as found in colloquial social media posts and texts scanned with optical character recognition. However, word-based methods currently require less computation time to train, so currently are preferable for classifying well-formatted and cleaned texts in single languages.","Adams, B; McKenzie, G",10.1111/tgis.12317,journalArticle,U9BE5NPH,2018,,1

Spatial classification with limited observations based on physics-aware structural constraint,NO,,,,"Spatial classification with limited feature observations has been a challenging problem in machine learning. The problem exists in applications where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial responses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation, classification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing features as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of samples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have missing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is observed for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint from the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient algorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the extended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world hydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature distribution in training samples is multi-modal. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Fake Job Detection and Analysis Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms,NO,,,,"With the pandemic situation, there is a strong rise in the number of online jobs posted on the internet in various job portals. But some of the jobs being posted online are actually fake jobs which lead to a theft of personal information and vital information. Thus, these fake jobs can be precisely detected and classified from a pool of job posts of both fake and real jobs by using advanced deep learning as well as machine learning classification algorithms. In this paper, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used so as to detect fake jobs and to differentiate them from real jobs. The data analysis part and data cleaning part are also proposed in this paper, so that the classification algorithm applied is highly precise and accurate. It has to be noted that the data cleaning step is a very important step in machine learning project because it actually determines the accuracy of the machine learning as well as deep learning algorithms. Hence a great importance is emphasized on data cleaning and pre-processing step in this paper. The classification and detection of fake jobs can be done with high accuracy and high precision. Hence the machine learning and deep learning algorithms have to be applied on cleaned and pre-processed data in order to achieve a better accuracy. Further, deep learning neural networks are used so as to achieve higher accuracy. Finally all these classification models are compared with each other to find the classification algorithm with highest accuracy and precision.","Anita, CS; Nagarajan, P; Sairam, GA; Ganesh, P; Deepakkumar, G",10.47059/revistageintec.v11i2.1701,journalArticle,YFRTNTKV,2021,,1

Anomaly detection based on machine learning in IoT-based vertical plant wall for indoor climate control,NO,,,,"Indoor climate is closely related to human health, comfort and productivity. Vertical plant wall systems, embedded with sensors and actuators, have become a promising application for indoor climate control. In this study, we explore the possibility of applying machine learning based anomaly detection methods to vertical plant wall systems so as to enhance the automation and improve the intelligence to realize predictive maintenance of the indoor climate. Two categories of anomalies, namely point anomalies and contextual anomalies are researched. Prediction-based and pattern recognition-based methods are investigated and applied to indoor climate anomaly detection. The results show that neural network-based models, specifically the autoencoder (AE) and the long short-term memory encoder decoder (LSTM-ED) model surpass the others in terms of detecting point anomalies and contextual anomalies, respectively, therefore can be deployed into vertical plant walls systems in industrial practice. Based on the results, a new data cleaning method is proposed and a prediction-based method is deployed to the cloud in practice as a proof-of-concept.

Data Repair without Prior Knowledge Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,YES,ML4DC,tabular,features,"In recent years, the use of wireless sensor networks has become increasingly widespread. Because of the instability of wireless networks, packet loss occasionally occurs. To reduce the impact of packet loss on data integrity, we take advantage of the deep neural network's excellent ability to understand natural data and propose a data repair method based on a deep convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder architecture. Compared with common interpolation algorithms and compressed sensing algorithms, this method obtains better repair results, is suitable for a wider range of applications, and does not need prior knowledge. This method adopts measures such as preparing training set data as well as the design and optimization of loss functions to achieve faster convergence speed, higher repair accuracy, and better stability. To fairly compare the repair performance of different signals, the mean squared error, relative peak-to-peak average error, and relative peak-to-peak max error are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the repair results of different signals. Comparative experiments prove that this method has better data recovery performance than traditional interpolation and compressed sensing algorithms.  2013 IEEE.","Qie, Youtian; Song, Ping; Hao, Chuangbo",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2999960,journalArticle,39NJDAPJ,2020,aug,1

Study on Determination of Excessive Emissions of Heavy Diesel Trucks Based on OBD Data Repaired,NO,,,,"It has been recognized that emission control for heavy diesel trucks should be given priority, as a massive amount of pollutants (e.g., NOx ) are emitted from heavy diesel trucks. Although pollutants can be filtered to a considerable extent by after-treatment devices equipment, emissions can still exceed the designated standards when after-treatment devices function improperly. To timely identify excessive emissions, we propose a general and systematic framework, including a data quality assessment and a data repairing and excessive emission determination process, based on the data sensed from the on-board diagnostics (OBD) monitoring system. To overcome the adverse effects of poor data quality, a set of approaches have been developed for the different statuses of data quality. When all variables contain missing or abnormal values, data repairing algorithms can be employed to improve data quality. Two strategies have been developed for the situation where only the NOx data is problematic. One is to improve data quality by using the other variables before identifying excessive emissions, and the other is to directly predict whether the emissions exceed recommendations by using other variables without the data quality problem. To reduce the impact of noise and extreme values, three methods based on the moving average principle have been developed to generate an aggregated emission level for the determination of excessive emissions. In the experimental study, we employed a number of machine learning algorithms to achieve data repairing and prediction. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm slightly outperforms the random forests (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) in the prediction of the excessive emission possibility in terms of prediction accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the most accurate data repairing can be achieved by probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), as compared to non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). However, the proposed approach does not restrict other algorithms from achieving the functions of data repairing and prediction.  2022 by the authors.

PREDICTION OF POLLUTANT DIFFUSION TREND USING DEEP LEARNING IN AIR QUALITY MONITORING BIG DATA,NO,,,,"Aiming at the problems that traditional air pollutant prediction models cannot meet the needs of intelligent processing of big data, and the processing effect is not ideal. A pollutant diffusion trend prediction model using deep learning in air quality monitoring big data is proposed. Firstly, the air pollutant data are preprocessed such as data cleaning, and the data features that can be used for prediction are selected by grey correlation analysis. Then, based on the deep belief network (DBN) learning and analyzing the data feature set, in order to realize the prediction of the diffusion trend of air pollutants. Finally, the two processes of pre-training of unsupervised learning and model parameter tuning of supervised learning are combined. Continuously fine-tune the parameters of the DBN model until the best predictive model structure is obtained. The proposed model is demonstrated experimentally based on the MATA-LAB simulation platform. The results show that the predicted value is very close to the actual value. Taking June as an example, the forecast result is the most accurate, and the highest root mean square error does not exceed 11.5, which has certain practical application value.","Yuan, ML; Wang, ZZ",,journalArticle,VGT9H4WN,2022,,1

Machine learning lessons learnt in stick-slip prediction,NO,,,,"Downhole vibration remains a major challenge for drillers. Today, there is technology to look at the problem from a unique perspective. A novel look at the problem focuses on evaluation of machine learning algorithms to predict downhole vibrations. Prediction is the first step in a longer road map. The goal would be to find an optimal combination of revolutions per minute (RPM) and weight-on-bit (WOB) to remedy drilling vibration in real-time, hence closing the loop. Drilling mechanics data for thousands of wells, acquired over more than ten years was analyzed. Some preparation of the drilling mechanics data was required. Data cleaning was first performed. This included corrections for time-dependent nature of the data. Data imputing for missing values and handling of outliers and anomalies was also performed in this stage. This was followed by feature engineering which included adding variables based on company-wide drilling domain expertise. Variables to capture data patterns and variables for better capturing the time-series dependencies were also created in this stage. This paper will discuss methodologies and general rules that were tested for preparing unstructured drilling data. A few of the machine learning algorithms used as building blocks of our full solution are gradient boosting and random forest. Deep learning models were also tested and the value of these are compared. The results were compiled to decide the best algorithm which could further be used to fine-tune optimum performance. The time series aspect of the data is captured in a moving window. As the window increases, the performance of each algorithm also varied. Also, evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of each algorithm for the drilling predictions is detailed. Ways to improve the accuracy of prediction for downhole vibrations is also suggested with reference to the results showing the logic behind all recommendations. There will be a summary of the details of each finding and a short discussion on the way forward for the industry.  2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers","Gupta, Soumya; Chatar, Crispin; Celaya, Jose R.",10.2118/197584-ms,conferencePaper,QYKJNU9N,2019,,1

QUIP: Query-driven Missing Value Imputation,NO,,,,"This paper develops a query-time missing value imputation framework, entitled QUIP, that minimizes the joint costs of imputation and query execution. QUIP achieves this by modifying how relational operators are processed. It adds a cost-based decision function in each operator that checks whether the operator should invoke imputation prior to execution or to defer the imputations for downstream operators to resolve. QUIP implements a new approach to evaluating outer join that preserve missing values during query processing, and a bloom filter based index structure to optimize the space and running overhead. We have implemented QUIP using ImputeDB - a specialized database engine for data cleaning. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of QUIP, which outperforms the state-of-the-art ImputeDB by 2 to 10 times on different query sets and data sets, and achieves the order-of-magnitudes improvement over offline approach.

A Two-Phase Deep Learning-Based Recommender System: Enhanced by a Data Quality Inspector,NO,,,,"Featured Application</p> Enhances the performance, specifically the accuracy, of a collaborative filtering-based recommender system, by exploiting textual data and filtering the initial input.</p> Research regarding collaborative filtering recommenders has grown fast lately. However, little attention has been paid to discuss how the input data quality impacts the result. Indeed, some review-rating pairs that a user gave to an item are inconsistent and express a different opinion, making the recommendation result biased. To solve the above drawback, this study proposes a two-phase deep learning-based recommender system. Firstly, a sentiment predictor of textual reviews is created, serving as the quality inspector that cleans and improves the input for a recommender. To build accurate predictors, this phase tries and compares a set of deep learning-based algorithms. Secondly, besides only exploiting the consistent review-rating pairs generated by the quality inspector, this phase builds deep learning-based recommender engines. The experiments on a real-world dataset showed the proposed data quality inspector, based on textual reviews, improves the overall performance of recommenders. On average, applying deep learning-based quality inspectors result in an above 6% improvement in RMSE, and more than a 2% boost in F1 score, and accuracy. This is robust evidence to prove the importance of the input data cleaning process in this field. Moreover, empirical evidence indicates the deep learning approach is suitable for modeling the sentiment predictor, and the core recommendation process, clearly outperforming the traditional machine learning methods.</p>","Leiva, WL; Li, ML; Tsai, CY",10.3390/app11209667,journalArticle,T8FDDU6S,2021,,1

IndoAcro: An Indonesian Acronym and Expansion Repository with Data Auto-Update Implementation,NO,,,,"IndoAcro is an Indonesian acronym and expansion repository created using machine learning and big data technology. The repository can be publicly accessed from www.indoacro.cs.unsyiah.ac.id. Six important steps of IndoAcro have been developed and implemented, which consists of (1) data crawling, (2) data cleaning, (3) generating candidate pairs of acronym and expansion, (4) generating numerical features, (5) classifying the candidate pairs, and (6) filtering the classification results. In this study, we introduce and analyze the implementation of data auto-update for IndoAcro. Since it was developed, IndoAcro has 2,232 pairs of acronym and expansion, collected from more than 50 thousand online news articles. Because no auto-update approach has been implemented previously, the number of acronym and expansion pairs in the database is monotonous, dull, and static. In this study, we introduce and analyze the implementation of data auto-update for IndoAcro. We have analyzed and evaluated the data auto-update process for 180 days, each process consists of 2 days interval. We found that the data auto-update approach has successfully implemented and updated the data for IndoAcro.

A data cleaning method for water quality based on improved hierarchical clustering algorithm,Specific,,,,"Identifying and rectifying incomplete water quality data is of vital importance. A data cleaning method based on improved balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) clustering algorithm is proposed. The clustering feature tree of water quality data is constructed and the cluster vector of the clustering feature tree is obtained by the agglomerative method. The optimal cluster number is determined according to the Bayesian Information Criterion and the nearest clustering ratio. The Pauta criterion is used to detect the global outlier and artificial neural network (ANN) is used to fill in outliers and missing values. Finally, the improved data cleaning method is applied to water quality monitoring data of Beijing wastewater treatment plant. The experimental results show that the data cleaning method can not only detect abnormal values and missing values accurately, but also normalise and complete missing data.

RECASNET: IMPROVING CONSISTENCY WITHIN THE TWO-STAGE MITOSIS DETECTION FRAMEWORK,NO,,,,"Mitotic count (MC) is an important histological parameter for cancer diagnosis and grading, but the manual process for obtaining MC from whole-slide histopathological images is very time-consuming and prone to error. Therefore, deep learning models have been proposed to facilitate this process. Existing approaches utilize a two-stage pipeline: the detection stage for identifying the locations of potential mitotic cells and the classification stage for refining prediction confidences. However, this pipeline formulation can lead to inconsistencies in the classification stage due to the poor prediction quality of the detection stage and the mismatches in training data distributions between the two stages. In this study, we propose a Refine Cascade Network (ReCasNet), an enhanced deep learning pipeline that mitigates the aforementioned problems with three improvements. First, window relocation was used to reduce the number of poor quality false positives generated during the detection stage. Second, object re-cropping was performed with another deep learning model to adjust poorly centered objects. Third, improved data selection strategies were introduced during the classification stage to reduce the mismatches in training data distributions. ReCasNet was evaluated on two large-scale mitotic figure recognition datasets, canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (CCMCT) and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC), which resulted in up to 4.8% percentage point improvements in the F1 scores for mitotic cell detection and 44.1% reductions in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for MC prediction. Techniques that underlie ReCasNet can be generalized to other two-stage object detection networks and should contribute to improving the performances of deep learning models in broad digital pathology applications.

Reservoir recovery estimation using data analytics and neural network based analogue study,NO,,,,"Reservoir analogue study, which is different with flow physics based prediction methods such as reservoir simulation, is based on human experience and knowledge from skilled reservoir engineers. In this work, we present a new workflow to replace the human knowledge-based analogue studies with data analytics and machine learning techniques. First, we collect reservoir properties, development parameters, and historical recovery data for 1381 actual U.S. oilfields from Tertiary Oil Recovery Information System (TORIS) by U.S. Department of Energy. We conduct extensive data cleaning for outliers and missing values. Then, we determine the most important determining factors for recovery factors. We further use single-variable and bi-variable analysis to understand relationship between recovery factor and determining factors. Finally, we use train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to make recovery factors predictions. We have found that the recovery factors mostly depend on 19 principal factors, a reduction from a total of more than 70 properties originally in TORIS. We randomly select data from 90% of these oilfields as training set for machine learning. The predictability and accuracy of such methodology is tested by making recovery forecasts for the remaining 10% oilfields and by comparing the forecasts with the actual recovery factors. Eventually, the average error in recovery factor predicted by the trained ANN model is about 10%. Overall, this methodology has shown strong performance in computer assisted analogue study, which shows minimum requirements on human knowledge and hands-on work to study these 1381 oilfields. This work provides a new workflow of using data analytics and machine learning techniques for reservoir analogues studies. Reservoir engineering software systematically built based on this methodology can serve as more efficient and accurate predictive tool in studying reservoir analogues.

"Rotom: A Meta-Learned Data Augmentation Framework for Entity Matching, Data Cleaning, Text Classification, and beyond",NO,,,,"Deep Learning revolutionizes almost all fields of computer science including data management. However, the demand for high-quality training data is slowing down deep neural nets' wider adoption. To this end, data augmentation (DA), which generates more labeled examples from existing ones, becomes a common technique. Meanwhile, the risk of creating noisy examples and the large space of hyper-parameters make DA less attractive in practice. We introduce Rotom, a multi-purpose data augmentation framework for a range of data management and mining tasks including entity matching, data cleaning, and text classification. Rotom features InvDA, a new DA operator that generates natural yet diverse augmented examples by formulating DA as a seq2seq task. The key technical novelty of Rotom is a meta-learning framework that automatically learns a policy for combining examples from different DA operators, whereby combinatorially reduces the hyper-parameters space. Our experimental results show that Rotom effectively improves a model's performance by combining multiple DA operators, even when applying them individually does not yield performance improvement. With this strength, Rotom outperforms the state-of-the-art entity matching and data cleaning systems in the low-resource settings as well as two recently proposed DA techniques for text classification.  2021 ACM.","Miao, Zhengjie; Li, Yuliang; Wang, Xiaolan",,bookSection,875VWDES,2021,,1

Cost-effective variational active entity resolution,YES,ML4DC,any,el,"Accurately identifying different representations of the same real-world entity is an integral part of data cleaning and many methods have been proposed to accomplish it. The challenges of this entity resolution task that demand so much research attention are often rooted in the task-specificity and user-dependence of the process. Adopting deep learning techniques has the potential to lessen these challenges. In this paper, we set out to devise an entity resolution method that builds on the robustness conferred by deep autoencoders to reduce human-involvement costs. Specifically, we reduce the cost of training deep entity resolution models by performing unsupervised representation learning. This unveils a transferability property of the resulting model that can further reduce the cost of applying the approach to new datasets by means of transfer learning. Finally, we reduce the cost of labeling training data through an active learning approach that builds on the properties conferred by the use of deep autoencoders. Empirical evaluation confirms the accomplishment of our cost-reduction desideratum, while achieving comparable effectiveness with state-of-the-art alternatives.  2021 IEEE.","Bogatu, Alex; Paton, Norman W.; Douthwaite, Mark; Davie, Stuart; Freitas, Andre",10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00114,conferencePaper,HTMRYCX9,2021,aug,1

Combining machine learning and semantics for anomaly detection,NO,,,,"The emergence of the Internet of Things and stream processing forces large scale organizations to consider anomaly detection as a key component of their business.

A Method for Duplicate Record Detection Using Deep Learning,YES,ML4DC,?,el,"As the scale of data in the database is growing rapidly, there exists the increasing number of duplicate information, which leads to data redundancy. Effective detection of duplicate records is of great significance for improving data quality and is an important issue in the field of data cleaning. At present, traditional duplicate record detection approaches use discrete features to build classification models which cannot express the semantic information well, and the classification accuracy needs to be improved. The deep learning model has good performance in feature extraction and classification. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel two-stage duplicate record detection model based on deep learning. In the first stage, the doc2vec model based on deep learning is applied to attribute vectorization construction, and the vector of record comparison pairs is constructed by concatenating attribute vectors. The second stage uses a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a classification model for all record comparison vectors.

Data cleaning: Overview and emerging challenges,Secondary works,,,,"Detecting and repairing dirty data is one of the perennial challenges in data analytics, and failure to do so can result in inaccurate analytics and unreliable decisions. Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest from both industry and academia on data cleaning problems including new abstractions, interfaces, approaches for scalability, and statistical techniques. To better understand the new advances in the field, we will first present a taxonomy of the data cleaning literature in which we highlight the recent interest in techniques that use constraints, rules, or patterns to detect errors, which we call qualitative data cleaning. We will describe the state-of-theart techniques and also highlight their limitations with a series of illustrative examples. While traditionally such approaches are distinct from quantitative approaches such as outlier detection, we also discuss recent work that casts such approaches into a statistical estimation framework including: using Machine Learning to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data cleaning and considering the effects of data cleaning on statistical analysis.  2016 ACM.","Chu, Xu; Ilyas, Ihab F.; Krishnan, Sanjay; Wang, Jiannan",10.1145/2882903.2912574,journalArticle,W7PLIH9S,2016,,1

Characterising the nationwide burden and predictors of unkept outpatient appointments in the National Health Service in England: A cohort study using a machine learning approach,NO,,,,"Background Unkept outpatient hospital appointments cost the National Health Service 1 pound billion each year. Given the associated costs and morbidity of unkept appointments, this is an issue requiring urgent attention. We aimed to determine rates of unkept outpatient clinic appointments across hospital trusts in the England. In addition, we aimed to examine the predictors of unkept outpatient clinic appointments across specialties at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHT). Our final aim was to train machine learning models to determine the effectiveness of a potential intervention in reducing unkept appointments. Methods and findings UK Hospital Episode Statistics outpatient data from 2016 to 2018 were used for this study. Machine learning models were trained to determine predictors of unkept appointments and their relative importance. These models were gradient boosting machines. In 2017-2018 there were approximately 85 million outpatient appointments, with an unkept appointment rate of 5.7%. Within ICHT, there were almost 1 million appointments, with an unkept appointment rate of 11.2%. Hepatology had the highest rate of unkept appointments (17%), and medical oncology had the lowest (6%). The most important predictors of unkept appointments included the recency (25%) and frequency (13%) of previous unkept appointments and age at appointment (10%). A sensitivity of 0.287 was calculated overall for specialties with at least 10,000 appointments in 2016-2017 (after data cleaning). This suggests that 28.7% of patients who do miss their appointment would be successfully targeted if the top 10% least likely to attend received an intervention. As a result, an intervention targeting the top 10% of likely non-attenders, in the full population of patients, would be able to capture 28.7% of unkept appointments if successful. Study limitations include that some unkept appointments may have been missed from the analysis because recording of unkept appointments is not mandatory in England. Furthermore, results here are based on a single trust in England, hence may not be generalisable to other locations. Conclusions Unkept appointments remain an ongoing concern for healthcare systems internationally. Using machine learning, we can identify those most likely to miss their appointment and implement more targeted interventions to reduce unkept appointment rates.","Philpott-Morgan, S; Thakrar, DB; Symons, J; Ray, D; Ashrafian, H; Darzi, A",10.1371/journal.pmed.1003783,journalArticle,SAWSKA5Z,2021,,1

SocialCCF: Graph-text Collaborative Cleaning Framework Based on Social Networks,NO,,,,"Although user-generated social media data contains rich information, many methods clean a large amount of raw data and can not build high-quality datasets for analysis. Recently, some data cleaning approaches using machine learning have demonstrated that they can potentially improve the quality of datasets. However, they only consider the text data but ignoring the heterogeneous social media data, such as images. To address these issues, we propose the novel graph-text collaborative cleaning framework based on social networks named SocialCCF, which leverages an end-to-end model from heterogeneous social media to obtain the specific-topic datasets to enhance the performance of the analysis. We do the experiments on three real datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model improves the performance and outperforms the whole baselines.  2020 IEEE.","Zhang, Yun; Jin, Zongze; Liu, Fan; Zhu, Weilin; Mu, Weimin; Wang, Weiping",10.1109/ICAIIS49377.2020.9194844,conferencePaper,TUCCLUV8,2020,,1

Unravelling a black box: an open-source methodology for the field calibration of small air quality sensors,NO,,,,"The last 2 decades have seen substantial technological advances in the development of low-cost air pollution instruments using small sensors. While their use continues to spread across the field of atmospheric chemistry, the air quality monitoring community, and for commercial and private use, challenges remain in ensuring data quality and comparability of calibration methods. This study introduces a seven-step methodology for the field calibration of low-cost sensor systems using reference instrumentation with user-friendly guidelines, open-access code, and a discussion of common barriers to such an approach. The methodology has been developed and is applicable for gas-phase pollutants, such as for the measurement of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or ozone (O-3). A full example of the application of this methodology to a case study in an urban environment using both multiple linear regression (MLR) and the random forest (RF) machine-learning technique is presented with relevant R code provided, including error estimation. In this case, we have applied it to the calibration of metal oxide gas-phase sensors (MOSs). Results reiterate previous findings that MLR and RF are similarly accurate, though with differing limitations. The methodology presented here goes a step further than most studies by including explicit transparent steps for addressing model selection, validation, and tuning, as well as addressing the common issues of autocorrelation and multicollinearity. We also highlight the need for standardized reporting of methods for data cleaning and flagging, model selection and tuning, and model metrics. In the absence of a standardized methodology for the calibration of low-cost sensor systems, we suggest a number of best practices for future studies using low-cost sensor systems to ensure greater comparability of research.","Schmitz, S; Towers, S; Villena, G; Caseiro, A; Wegener, R; Klemp, D; Langer, I; Meier, F; von Schneidemesser, E",10.5194/amt-14-7221-2021,journalArticle,XNV5FM85,2021,,1

Computer vision and deep learningbased data anomaly detection method for structural health monitoring,NO,,,,"The widespread application of sophisticated structural health monitoring systems in civil infrastructures produces a large volume of data. As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learningbased data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.

A two-tier convolutional neural network for combined detection and segmentation in biological imagery,NO,,,,"Deep learning techniques have been useful for modern microscopy imaging techniques to further study and analyze biological structures and organs. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved 2D object detection, localization, and segmentation. For imagery containing biological structures with depth, it is especially desirable to perform these tasks in 3D. Traditionally, performing these tasks simultaneously in 3D has proven to be computationally expensive. Currently available methodologies thus largely work to segment 3D objects from 2D images (without context from captured 3D volumes). In this work, we present a novel approach to perform fast and accurate localization, detection, and segmentation of volumes containing cells. Specifically, in our method, we modify and tune two state-of-the-art CNNs, namely 2D YOLOv2 and 3D U-Net, and combine them with a new fusion and image processing algorithms. Annotated volumes in this space are limited, and we have created synthetic data that mimics actual structures for training and testing our proposed approach. Promising results on this test data demonstrate the value of the technique and offers a methodology for 3D cell analysis in real microscopy imagery.  2019 IEEE.","Ziabari, Amirkoushyar; Shirinifard, Abbas; Eicholtz, Matthew R.; Solecki, David J.; Rose, Derek C.",10.1109/GlobalSIP45357.2019.8969303,conferencePaper,QB6XZYPE,2019,,1
Optimal load forecasting model for peer-to-peer energy trading in smart grids,NO,,,,"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electricity trading is a significant research area that offers maximum fulfilment for both prosumer and consumer. It also decreases the quantity of line loss incurred in Smart Grid (SG). But, uncertainities in demand and supply of the electricity might lead to instability in P2P market for both prosumer and consumer. In recent times, numerous Machine Learning (ML)-enabled load predictive techniques have been developed, while most of the existing studies did not consider its implicit features, optimal parameter selection, and prediction stability. In order to overcome fulfill this research gap, the current research paper presents a new Multi-Objective Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (MOGOA) with Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM)-based short-term load predictive technique i.e., MOGOA-DELM model for P2P Energy Trading (ET) in SGs. The proposed MOGOA-DELM model involves four distinct stages of operations namely, data cleaning, Feature Selection (FS), prediction, and parameter optimization. In addition, MOGOA-based FS technique is utilized in the selection of optimum subset of features. Besides, DELM-based predictive model is also applied in forecasting the load requirements. The proposed MOGOA model is also applied in FS and the selection of optimal DELM parameters to improve the predictive outcome. To inspect the effectual outcome of the proposed MOGOA-DELM model, a series of simulations was performed using UK Smart Meter dataset. In the experimentation procedure, the proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 85.80% and the results established the superiority of the proposed model in predicting the testing data.  2021 Tech Science Press.

Social Sensing for Urban Land Use Identification,NO,,,,"The utilization of urban land use maps can reveal the patterns of human behavior through the extraction of the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of urban land use. Remote sensing that holds detailed and abundant information on spectral, textual, contextual, and spatial configurations is crucial to obtaining land use maps that reveal changes in the urban environment. However, social sensing is essential to revealing the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of urban land use. This data mining approach is related to data cleaning/outlier removal and machine learning, and is used to achieve land use classification from remote and social sensing data. In bicycle and taxi density maps, the daytime destination and nighttime origin density reflects work-related land uses, including commercial and industrial areas. By contrast, the nighttime destination and daytime origin density pattern captures the pattern of residential areas. The accuracy assessment of land use classified maps shows that the integration of remote and social sensing, using the decision tree and random forest methods, yields accuracies of 83% and 86%, respectively. Thus, this approach facilitates an accurate urban land use classification. Urban land use identification can aid policy makers in linking human activities to the socioeconomic consequences of different urban land uses.","Anugraha, AS; Chu, HJ; Ali, MZ",10.3390/ijgi9090550,journalArticle,6XZRPHS9,2020,,1

The State-of-the-Art in Predictive Visual Analytics,NO,,,,"Predictive analytics embraces an extensive range of techniques including statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining and is applied in business intelligence, public health, disaster management and response, and many other fields. To date, visualization has been broadly used to support tasks in the predictive analytics pipeline. Primary uses have been in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and diagnostics. For example, scatterplots and bar charts are used to illustrate class distributions and responses. More recently, extensive visual analytics systems for feature selection, incremental learning, and various prediction tasks have been proposed to support the growing use of complex models, agent-specific optimization, and comprehensive model comparison and result exploration. Such work is being driven by advances in interactive machine learning and the desire of end-users to understand and engage with the modeling process. In this state-of-the-art report, we catalogue recent advances in the visualization community for supporting predictive analytics. First, we define the scope of predictive analytics discussed in this article and describe how visual analytics can support predictive analytics tasks in a predictive visual analytics (PVA) pipeline. We then survey the literature and categorize the research with respect to the proposed PVA pipeline. Systems and techniques are evaluated in terms of their supported interactions, and interactions specific to predictive analytics are discussed.

GraphER: Token-centric entity resolution with graph convolutional neural networks,YES,ML4DC,tabular,el,"Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify entity records that refer to the same real-world entity, which is a critical problem in data cleaning and integration. Most of the existing models are attribute-centric, that is, matching entity pairs by comparing similarities of pre-aligned attributes, which require the schemas of records to be identical and are too coarse-grained to capture subtle key information within a single attribute. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based ER model GraphER. Our model is token-centric: the final matching results are generated by directly aggregating token-level comparison features, in which both the semantic and structural information has been softly embedded into token embeddings by training an Entity Record Graph Convolutional Network (ER-GCN). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first effort to do token-centric entity resolution with the help of GCN in entity resolution task.

Towards automated patient data cleaning using deep learning: A feasibility study on the standardization of organ labeling,Specific,,,,"Data cleaning consumes about 80% of the time spent on data analysis for clinical research projects. This is a much bigger problem in the era of big data and machine learning in the field of medicine where large volumes of data are being generated. We report an initial effort towards automated patient data cleaning using deep learning: the standardization of organ labeling in radiation therapy. Organs are often labeled inconsistently at different institutions (sometimes even within the same institution) and at different time periods, which poses a problem for clinical research, especially for multi-institutional collaborative clinical research where the acquired patient data is not being used effectively. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically identify each organ in the CT image and then label it with the standardized nomenclature presented at AAPM Task Group 263. We tested this model on the CT images of 54 patients with prostate and 100 patients with head and neck cancer who previously received radiation therapy. The model achieved 100% accuracy in detecting organs and assigning standardized labels for the patients tested. This work shows the feasibility of using deep learning in patient data cleaning that enables standardized datasets to be generated for effective intra- and interinstitutional collaborative clinical research.

The Effects of Class Label Noise on Highly-Imbalanced Big Data,related,,,,"This study explores the effects of class label noise on a highly-imbalanced big data set by injecting varying levels of class noise into a Medicare Part B fraud detection data set. Noise parameters are used to vary the total level of class noise and the proportion of class noise between the majority and minority classes. This allows us to better understand how class noise affects imbalanced data sets and where data cleaning efforts should be focused. Four popular machine learning algorithms are evaluated using six rounds of five-fold cross-validation to determine which learners are most robust to class noise. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) results shows that negative class noise, i.e. when positive instances are incorrectly labeled as negative, has the greatest adverse effect on classification performance. Statistical results show that the XGBoost learner performs significantly better than Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Regression Learners. True positive rates and true negative rates show that there is a trade-off that occurs as the noise proportion switches between the majority and negative classes. Finally, we show that the effects of class label noise can be combatted by regularizing the XGBoost learner through shallower decision trees.  2021 IEEE.","Kennedy, Robert K.

Learning to denoise raw mobile UI layouts for improving datasets at scale,NO,,,,"The layout of a mobile screen is a critical data source for UI design research and semantic understanding of the screen. However, UI layouts in existing datasets are often noisy, have mismatches with their visual representation, or consists of generic or app-specific types that are difficult to analyze and model. In this paper, we propose the CLAY pipeline that uses a deep learning approach for denoising UI layouts, allowing us to automatically improve existing mobile UI layout datasets at scale. Our pipeline takes both the screenshot and the raw UI layout, and annotates the raw layout by removing incorrect nodes and assigning a semantically meaningful type to each node. To experiment with our data-cleaning pipeline, we create the CLAY dataset of 59,555 human-annotated screen layouts, based on screenshots and raw layouts from Rico, a public mobile UI corpus. Our deep models achieve high accuracy with F1 scores of 82.7% for detecting layout objects that do not have a valid visual representation and 85.9% for recognizing object types, which significantly outperforms a heuristic baseline. Our work lays a foundation for creating large-scale high quality UI layout datasets for data-driven mobile UI research and reduces the need of manual labeling efforts that are prohibitively expensive.

An Adaptive Parameters Density Cluster Algorithm for Data Cleaning in Big Data,YES,ML4DC,?,features,"We have entered the era of information explosion, data has become an important driving force for the development of the industry. The huge wealth hidden in the data, enterprises can obtain a lot of useful information from business management, market analysis, scientific exploration and other aspects to support the development decisions of enterprises.

Ed2: A case for active learning in error detection,YES,ML4DC,?,features,"State-of-the-art approaches formulate error detection as a semi-supervised classification problem. Recent research suggests that active learning is insufficiently effective for error detection and proposes the usage of neural networks and data augmentation to reduce the number of these user-provided labels. However, we can show that using the appropriate active learning strategy, it is possible to outperform the more complex models that rely on data augmentation. To this end, we propose a multi-classifier approach with two-stage sampling for active learning. This intuitive and neat sampling method chooses the most promising cells across rows and columns for labeling. On three datasets, ED2 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while for large datasets, the required number of user labels is lower by one order of magnitude compared to the state of the art.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Neutatz, Felix; Mahdavi, Mohammad; Abedjan, Ziawasch",10.1145/3357384.3358129,conferencePaper,33ZSHNV9,2019,aug,1

Tracing Knowledge in Language Models Back to the Training Data,NO,,,,"Neural language models (LMs) have been shown to memorize a great deal of factual knowledge. But when an LM generates an assertion, it is often difficult to determine where it learned this information and whether it is true. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for fact tracing: tracing language models assertions back to the training examples that provided evidence for those predictions. Prior work has suggested that dataset-level influence methods might offer an effective framework for tracing predictions back to training data. However, such methods have not been evaluated for fact tracing, and researchers primarily have studied them through qualitative analysis or as a data cleaning technique for classification/regression tasks. We present the first experiments that evaluate influence methods for fact tracing, using well-understood information retrieval (IR) metrics. We compare two popular families of influence methods  gradient-based and embedding-based  and show that neither can fact-trace reliably; indeed, both methods fail to outperform an IR baseline (BM25) that does not even access the LM. We explore why this occurs (e.g., gradient saturation) and demonstrate that existing influence methods must be improved significantly before they can reliably attribute factual predictions in LMs.1 Copyright  2022, The Authors.

Energy consumption clustering using machine learning: K-means approach,NO,,,,"Nowadays, the accurate analysis of energy consumption has become vital for the development of efficient energy projects as well as, for demonstrating the consumptive behavior of the energy consumers in the system. The importance of this analysis comes from many reasons, one of them is that it leads to a better understanding of the system components. This paper presents a clustering algorithm for residential energy consumption using the K-Means algorithm in two different approaches. The dataset utilized in this article contains energy consumption features selected from 25 houses over a period of two years. Firstly, data cleaning has been used to remove and eliminate the inconsistent data, secondly the Elbow method has been applied to determine the optimal number of clusters before using the K-means approach for the purpose of clustering. In Kmeans, the data have been clustered into two different approaches. The first one is clustering the daily mean consumption in each season in each year. The second one is clustering the monthly mean consumption over the two years. Finally, data visualization has been applied in order to present the result of our proposed method. The paper finds that the households have different consumption behaviors in different seasons, days, and months and that it is due to the change of the average temperature in each season as well as the different appliances and consumptive patters of each house. The results are representative and match the aim of the paper. Further, they are significant for the further development of the energy system and efficient for tracking the consumption of the houses. Finally, the results of this paper are going to be used after running the algorithm again with a different number of clusters to compare the results and find new insights in the data that might affect the decision.  2021 IEEE.","Al Skaif, Aghyad; Ayache, Mohammad; Kanaan, Hussein",10.1109/ACIT53391.2021.9677130,conferencePaper,T3T9ZTSR,2021,,1

Design and application of soil moisture content monitoring system based on cloud-native technology,NO,,,,"To meet the demand of soil moisture content monitoring on a national scale, at the level of data acquisition, a soil moisture content data acquisition and perception technology system based on in-situ monitoring of automatic soil moisture content monitoring station and multi-source heterogeneous thematic data was constructed in this study, which realized the online monitoring of soil moisture content and multi-source data fusion. Further in terms of data quality control in the soil moisture data quality control strategy was proposed for data cleaning and established the soil moisture content data correction and interpolation model, in the cloud background received by the TCP/IP protocol of the Internet of things device came back after the packet data parsing and quality judgment. For abnormal or missing data, through the calibration data interpolation model to predict, avoided the interruption problem caused by the missing data, ensured data accuracy, integrity, and availability. Moreover, the soil moisture content data correction and interpolation model adopted the deep learning algorithm and the Stacking strategy to merge the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) networks. The soil moisture content monitoring system facing the national scale had the characteristics of a large number of automatic station devices, massive user visits, and vast amounts of data computation, and had the characteristics of high frequency, high concurrency, and continuous growth. The ordinary web architecture could not ensure the stable and reliable operation of the system. Therefore, the system adopted the cloud-native technology system suitable for the cloud computing characteristics, used the micro-service architecture and the container technology to construct a flexible development model, and improved the efficiency of computing resource utilization. The system architecture design was based on the cloud-native technology, the module of the system was flexibly developed and deployed in the form of micro-services, the independent instance of packaging and running container technology was used to solve the problem of environmental configuration and resource utilization efficiency, and the container was dynamically scheduled to optimize the utilization of cloud computing resources. The core modules such as soil moisture content data reporting collection, soil moisture content data visualization analysis, and soil moisture content data mining application were arranged in the system. Based on GIS (Geographic Information System) spatial analysis and WebGL technology, the front-end 3D WebGIS data analysis function module was developed, and the collaborative Kriging interpolation method was used to realize the online analysis and visual mapping of collaborative soil moisture content, land use types, altitude, and other multi-source data. The system mined the data value deeply and utilized the deep learning algorithm to realize the soil moisture content prediction service which used the data of the past 8 days to predict the data of the next day. Based on the principle of water balance, the application service of irrigation decision was realized. By selecting the crop coefficient recommended by FAO and the growth stage of the corresponding planting crops, the water demand of crops was calculated, and the water balance analysis was realized and the reference irrigation water quantity was recommended. Since its application, the system had been deeply applied in more than 21 provinces, 970 automatic monitoring stations had been established, and more than 60 million automatic moisture monitoring stations had been collected. The system provided reliable data sources and technical support for decision-making departments, agricultural technicians, researchers, and other users to master the current situation of soil moisture content, guide agricultural water-saving irrigation, and obtain accurate and continuous soil moisture content scientific research data.  2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

A comparison of machine learning methods of sentiment analysis based on Russian language twitter data,NO,,,,"The paper is focused on comparing the performance of different techniques of text tonality analysis, a widely used approach in business to conduct social listening research. However, there are still debates on what type of models perform better for NLP classification tasks. On a corpus of Russian language tweets three models were tested to solve binary classification problem: Logistic regression (LR), XGBoost classifier and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The paper descriptively overviews main techniques useful for data cleaning and preprocessing for these methods and covers its possible fitfalls. Based on the study CNN showed best results among chosen models, which goes in line with several articles in the field for other than Russian languages. Together with high predictive results, neural networks exhibit a computational drawback - their performance is poor in terms of timings. Besides this, all methods showed high sensitivity to the way data is preprocessed, which is a product of Russian language variability. This leads to a conclusion that there is still a room for improvement - in future research more emphasis will be put on hyper parameter tuning for""boosting type"" models and extending list of applied methods.

Selecting Data to Clean for Fact Checking: Minimizing Uncertainty vs. Maximizing Surprise,traditional DC,,,,"We study the optimization problem of selecting numerical quantities to clean in order to fact-check claims based on such data. Oftentimes, such claims are technically correct, but they can still mislead for two reasons. First, data may contain uncertainty and errors. Second, data can be ""fished"" to advance particular positions. In practice, fact-checkers cannot afford to clean all data and must choose to clean what ""matters the most"" to checking a claim. We explore alternative definitions of what ""matters the most"": one is to ascertain claim qualities (by minimizing uncertainty in these measures), while an alternative is just to counter the claim (by maximizing the probability of finding a counterargument). We show whether the two objectives align with each other, with important implications on when fact-checkers should exercise care in selective data cleaning, to avoid potential bias introduced by their desire to counter claims. We develop efficient algorithms for solving the various variants of the optimization problem, showing significant improvements over naive solutions. The problem is particularly challenging because the objectives in the fact-checking context are complex, non-linear functions over data. We obtain results that generalize to a large class of functions, with potential applications beyond fact-checking. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Predictive analytics for data driven decision support in health and care,NO,,,,"Due to an ever-increasing amount of data generated in healthcare each day, healthcare professionals are more and more challenged with information. Predictive models based on machine learning algorithms can help to quickly identify patterns in clinical data. Requirements for data driven decision support systems for health and care (DS4H) are similar in many ways to applications in other domains. However, there are also various challenges which are specific to health and care settings. The present paper describes a) healthcare specific requirements for DS4H and b) how they were addressed in our Predictive Analytics Toolset for Health and care (PATH). PATH supports the following process: objective definition, data cleaning and pre-processing, feature engineering, evaluation, result visualization, interpretation and validation and deployment. The current state of the toolset already allows the user to switch between the various involved levels, i. e. raw data (ECG), pre-processed data (averaged heartbeat), extracted features (QT time), built models (to classify the ECG into a certain rhythm abnormality class) and outcome evaluation (e. g. a false positive case) and to assess the relevance of a given feature in the currently evaluated model as a whole and for the individual decision. This allows us to gain insights as a basis for improvements in the various steps from raw data to decisions.  2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","Hayn, Dieter; Veeranki, Sai; Kropf, Martin; Eggerth, Alphons; Kreiner, Karl; Kramer, Diether; Schreier, Gunter",10.1515/itit-2018-0004,journalArticle,FCG9UE93,2021,,1

LOCATER: Cleaning WiFi Connectivity Datasets for Semantic Localization,NO,,,,"This paper explores the data cleaning challenges that arise in using WiFi connectivity data to locate users to semantic indoor locations such as buildings, regions, rooms. WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections between devices and nearby WiFi access points (APs), each of which may cover a relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data cleaning tasks - first, it treats the problem of determining the AP to which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a missing value detection and repair problem. It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem. LOCATER uses a bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method for coarse localization and a probabilistic method to achieve finer localization. The paper shows that LOCATER can achieve significantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fine levels. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

A review and evaluation of the state-of-the-art in PV solar power forecasting: Techniques and optimization,NO,,,,"Integration of photovoltaics into power grids is difficult as solar energy is highly dependent on climate and geography; often fluctuating erratically. This causes penetrations and voltage surges, system instability, inefficient utilities planning and financial loss. Forecast models can help; however, time stamp, forecast horizon, input correlation analysis, data pre and post-processing, weather classification, network optimization, uncertainty quantification and performance evaluations need consideration. Thus, contemporary forecasting techniques are reviewed and evaluated. Input correlational analyses reveal that solar irradiance is most correlated with Photovoltaic output, and so, weather classification and cloud motion study are crucial. Moreover, the best data cleansing processes: normalization and wavelet transforms, and augmentation using generative adversarial network are recommended for network training and forecasting. Furthermore, optimization of inputs and network parameters, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is emphasized. Next, established performance evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE are discussed, with suggestions for including economic utility metrics. Subsequently, modelling approaches are critiqued, objectively compared and categorized into physical, statistical, artificial intelligence, ensemble and hybrid approaches. It is determined that ensembles of artificial neural networks are best for forecasting short term photovoltaic power forecast and online sequential extreme learning machine superb for adaptive networks; while Bootstrap technique optimum for estimating uncertainty. Additionally, convolutional neural network is found to excel in eliciting a model's deep underlying non-linear input-output relationships. The conclusions drawn impart fresh insights in photovoltaic power forecast initiatives, especially in the use of hybrid artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.","Ahmed, R.; Sreeram, V.; Mishra, Y.; Arif, M.D.",10.1016/j.rser.2020.109792,journalArticle,DUTIXUNR,2020,,1

Sampling for Big Data Profiling: A Survey,NO,,,,"Due to the development of internet technology and computer science, data is exploding at an exponential rate. Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Sampling technology has been widely used in big data context. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Hence this article focuses on researching sampling for data profiling tasks in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.",Z.

ML may be used to determine if a person has a cardiovascular illness based on particular characteristics such as chest discomfort, cholesterol levels, age, and other factors. Cardiovascular disease diagnosis can be simplified using ML classification algorithms that are based on supervised learning. To distinguish those with cardiac illness from those who do not, many ML algorithms are being used including Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier and Random Forest.. The dataset contains certain irrelevant features that are removed during the data cleaning stage, and the data is also standardized for better results. The results and analyses of the publicly available ML Heart Disease dataset are being compared in this paper using different ML methods. The accuracy as well as confusion matrix are also being used to validate a good amount of promising outcomes.  2021 IEEE.","Sarveshvar, M.R.; Gogoi, Anindita; Chaubey, Amrit Kumar; Rohit, S.; Mahesh, T.R.",10.1109/FABS52071.2021.9702566,conferencePaper,ATEGNBQ2,2021,,1

A flexible outlier detector based on a topology given by graph communities,YES,DC4ML,tabular,label,"Outlier, or anomaly, detection is essential for optimal performance of machine learning methods and statistical predictive models. It is not just a technical step in a data cleaning process but a key topic in many fields such as fraudulent document detection, in medical applications and assisted diagnosis systems or detecting security threats. In contrast to population-based methods, neighborhood based local approaches are simple flexible methods that have the potential to perform well in small sample size unbalanced problems. However, a main concern of local approaches is the impact that the computation of each sample neighborhood has on the method performance. Most approaches use a distance in the feature space to define a single neighborhood that requires careful selection of several parameters. This work presents a local approach based on a local measure of the heterogeneity of sample labels in the feature space considered as a topological manifold. Topology is computed using the communities of a weighted graph codifying mutual nearest neighbors in the feature space. This way, we provide with a set of multiple neighborhoods able to describe the structure of complex spaces without parameter fine tuning. The extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach overall outperforms, both, local and global strategies in multi and single view settings. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

A data-driven approach to predict NOx-emissions of gas turbines,NO,,,,"Predicting the state of modern heavy-duty gas turbines for large-scale power generation allows for making informed decisions on their operation and maintenance. Their emission behavior however is coupled to a multitude of operating parameters and to the state and aging of the engine, making the underlying mechanisms very complex to model through physical, first-order approaches. In this paper, we demonstrate that accurate emission models of gas turbines can be derived using machine learning techniques. We present empirical results on a broad range of machine learning algorithms applied to historical data collected from long-term engine operation. A custom data-cleaning pipeline is presented to considerably boost performance. Our best results match the measurement precision of the emission monitoring system, accurately describing the evolution of the engine state and supporting informed decision making for engine adjustment and maintenance scheduling.  2017 IEEE.","Cuccu, Giuseppe; Danafar, Somayeh; Cudre-Mauroux, Philippe; Gassner, Martin; Bernero, Stefano; Kryszczuk, Krzysztof",10.1109/BigData.2017.8258056,conferencePaper,ZJW9H64T,2017,,1

Analysis of Feature Selection Techniques for Classification Problems,NO,,,,"Feature Selection problem is increasingly recognized as one of the key areas in academic research that employs data-driven or computationally-intensive approaches. Huge collection of data available for the research community and access to data aggregation techniques that help to easily get vast amounts of data, bring number of other problems. More data is not always better. Data mainly comes with noise distracting from what is more important. Data cleaning and pre-processing is long and resource consuming process. When it comes to widely used supervised machine learning approach, more data requires more time and more computation power for the training. This is why right data that represents entire population of cases is better than just more data. Feature selection is the process that helps to address two key issues associated with data-driven systems: dimensionality reduction of the data to increase performance and selecting features that produce most accurate model. The main purpose of this study is to review feature selection methods applied on real data.  2021 IEEE.","Adamov, Abzetdin Z.",10.1109/AICT52784.2021.9620226,conferencePaper,Y6JBYEPX,2021,,1

Correlation analysis within the data sets is performed to figure out how significant the sensor data contributes to the predictive target. An flexible neural network based modeling mechanism is implemented, in which the user can design the model based on the correlation analysis.

Building energy consumption raw data forecasting using data cleaning and deep recurrent neural networks,NO,,,,"With the rising focus on building energy big data analysis, there lacks a framework for raw data preprocessing to answer the question of how to handle the missing data in the raw data set. This study presents a methodology and framework for building energy consumption raw data forecasting. A case building is used to forecast the energy consumption by using deep recurrent neural networks. Four different methodologies to impute missing data in the raw data set are compared and implemented. The question of sensitivity of gap size and available data percentage on the imputation accuracy was tested. The cleaned data were then used for building energy forecasting. While the existing studies explored only the use of small recurrent networks of 2 layers and less, the question of whether a deep network of more than 2 layers would be performing better for building energy consumption forecasting should be explored. In addition, the problem of overfitting has been cited as a significant problem in using deep networks. In this study, the deep recurrent neural network is then used to explore the use of deeper networks and their regularization in the context of an energy load forecasting task. The results show a mean absolute error of 2.1 can be achieved through the 2*32 gated neural network model. In applying regularization methods to overcome model overfitting, the study found that weights regularization did indeed delay the onset of overfitting.","Junjing Yang; Kok Keng Tan; Santamouris, M.; Siew Eang Lee",10.3390/buildings9090204,journalArticle,V6MJHFTR,2019,,1

TCM Tongue Color Classification Method under Noisy Labeling,NO,,,,"Tongue color is one of the most concerned diagnostic features of tongue diagnosis in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Automatic and accurate tongue color classification is an important content of the objectification of tongue diagnosis. Due to the vagueness of the visual boundaries between different types of tongue colors and the subjectivity of the doctors, the annotated tongue image data samples often contain noises, which has a negative effect on the training of the tongue color classification model. Therefore, in this paper, a tongue color classification method in TCM with noisy labels is proposed. Firstly, a two-stage data cleaning method is proposed to identify and clean noisy labeled samples. Secondly, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the channel attention mechanism is designed in this paper to achieve accurate classification of tongue color by enhancing the expressiveness of features. Finally, a knowledge distillation strategy with a noise sample filtering mechanism is proposed. This strategy adds a noise sample filtering mechanism led by the teacher network to eliminate further noise samples. At the same time, the teacher network is used to guide the training of the light convolutional neural network to improve the classification performance.The experimental results on the self-established TCM tongue color classification dataset show that the proposed method in this paper can significantly improve the classification accuracy with lower computational complexity, reaching 93.88%.  2022, Science Press.

Data-cleaning method based on dynamic fusion LOF for municipal wastewater treatment process,Specific,,,,"In order to reduce the impact of continuous data noise and loss, a dynamic fusion local outlier factor (DFLOF) method is proposed for data-cleaning of the municipal wastewater treatment process (WWTP). First, a data dynamic segmentation method based on sliding window is designed to obtain the abnormal attribute of each segment, including mean value, maximum value and peak interval. Then, a data reliability evaluation model based on the DFLOF is established to evaluate each data segment by using the dynamic fusion local outlier factor algorithm, which improves the accuracy of abnormal data detection and elimination. Finally, a data compensation method based on radial basis function neural network is proposed to compensate the missing data and further realize the data-cleaning of the WWTP. The proposed cleaning method is applied to a real WWTP, the experimental results show that the data-cleaning method based on the dynamic fusion local outlier factor is able to clear abnormal data and improve the data quality.

EVFL: An explainable vertical federated learning for data-oriented Artificial Intelligence systems,NO,,,,"Vertical federated learning (VFL), as one of the latest advances of security in the data-oriented Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, facilitates better keeping the AI systems converge faster with higher performance and security. Since a large amount of data from these systems is often of low quality, the training data needs to be interpreted and evaluated. While there have been some research efforts, they still have significant shortcomings, such as high computational complexity and impracticality. Considering the characteristics of the data, the interpretation of machine learning models allows for data cleansing, which can improve data quality and help regulators understand the decision-making process. In this paper, we propose an explainable vertical federated learning (EVFL) framework, including the credibility assessment strategy, the federated counterfactual explanation and the importance rate (IR) metric. Furthermore, we initialize the knowledge-based counterfactual instance based on prior knowledge and retrain the federated counterfactual method for feasible counterfactual features.

Partial Discharge Diagnostics: Data Cleaning and Feature Extraction,Specific,,,,"Detection of partial discharge (PD) in switchgears requires extensive data collection and time-consuming analyses. Data from real live operational environments pose great challenges in the development of robust and efficient detection algorithms due to overlapping PDs and the strong presence of random white noise. This paper presents a novel approach using clustering for data cleaning and feature extraction of phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) plots derived from live operational data. A total of 452 PRPD 2D plots collected from distribution substations over a six-month period were used to test the proposed technique. The output of the clustering technique is evaluated on different types of machine learning classification techniques and the accuracy is compared using balanced accuracy score. The proposed technique extends the measurement abilities of a portable PD measurement tool for diagnostics of switchgear condition, helping utilities to quickly detect potential PD activities with minimal human manual analysis and higher accuracy.  2022 by the authors.

Data-Driven Prediction of Route-Level Energy Use for Mixed-Vehicle Transit Fleets,NO,,,,"Due to increasing concerns about environmental impact, operating costs, and energy security, public transit agencies are seeking to reduce their fuel use by employing electric vehicles (EVs), However, because of the high upfront cost of EVs, most agencies can afford only mixed fleets of internal-combustion and electric vehicles. Making the best use of these mixed fleets presents a challenge for agencies since optimizing the assignment of vehicles to transit routes, scheduling charging, etc. require accurate predictions of electricity and fuel use. Recent advances in sensor-based technologies, data analytics, and machine learning enable remedying this situation; however, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no framework that would integrate all relevant data into a route-level prediction model for public transit. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the data-driven prediction of route-level energy use for mixed-vehicle transit fleets, which we evaluate using data collected from the bus fleet of CARTA, the public transit authority of Chattanooga, TN. We present a data collection and storage framework, which we use to capture system-level data, including traffic and weather conditions, and high-frequency vehicle-level data, including location traces, fuel or electricity use, etc. We present domain-specific methods and algorithms for integrating and cleansing data from various sources, including street and elevation maps. Finally, we train and evaluate machine learning models, including deep neural networks, decision trees, and linear regression, on our integrated dataset. Our results show that neural networks provide accurate estimates, while other models can help us discover relations between energy use and factors such as road and weather conditions.","Ayman, A.; Wilbur, M.; Sivagnanam, A.; Pugliese, P.; Dubey, A.; Laszka, A.",10.1109/SMARTCOMP50058.2020.00026,conferencePaper,7I4WAT25,2020,,1

Age-Net: An MRI-Based Iterative Framework for Biological Age Estimation [arXiv],NO,,,,"The concept of biological age (BA) - although important in clinical practice - is hard to grasp mainly due to lack of a clearly defined reference standard. For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA estimation is restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging patients (BA $\not \approx$ CA) from the given population. In this manner, we hypothesize that the remaining population should approximate the true BA behaviour. For this initial study, we apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients. A statistical and visualization-based analysis has provided evidence regarding the potential and current challenges of the proposed methodology.","Armanious, K.; Abdulatif, S.; Wenbin Shi; Salian, S.; Kustner, T.; Weiskopf, D.; Hepp, T.; Gatidis, S.; Bin Yang",,journalArticle,S7MD2PHM,2020,,1
A Multi-purpose Data Pre-processing Framework using Machine Learning for Enterprise Data Models,NO,,,,"Growth in the data processing industry has automated decision making for various domains such as engineering, education and also many fields of research. The increased growth has also accelerated higher dependencies on the data driven business decisions on enterprise scale data models. The accuracy of such decisions solely depends on correctness of the data. In the recent past, a good number of data cleaning methods are projected by various research attempts. Nonetheless, most of these outcomes are criticized for higher generalness or higher specificness. Thus, the demand for multipurpose, however domain specific, framework for enterprise scale data pre-processing is in demand in the recent time. Hence, this work proposes a novel framework for data cleaning method as missing value identification using the standard domain length with significantly reduced time complexity, domain specific outlier identification using customizable rule engine, detailed generic outlier reduction using double differential clustering and finally dimensionality reduction using the change percentage dependency mapping. The outcome from this framework is significantly impressive as the outliers and missing treatment showcases nearly 99% accuracy over benchmarked dataset.  2021.

Deep Q-Network-Based Feature Selection for Multisourced Data Cleaning,not sure,,,,"The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates information collected from multisources and is able to support various intelligent smart city applications, such as industrial manufacturing, power systems, and mobile healthcare. In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks.  2014 IEEE.","Wang, Qianlong; Guo, Yifan; Yu, Lixing; Chen, Xuhui; Li, Pan",10.1109/JIOT.2020.3016297,journalArticle,V8PBVET4,2021,,1

Machine learning to data management: A round trip,Secondary works,,,,"With the emergence of machine learning (ML) techniques in database research, ML has already proved a tremendous potential to dramatically impact the foundations, algorithms, and models of several data management tasks, such as error detection, data cleaning, data integration, and query inference. Part of the data preparation, standardization, and cleaning processes, such as data matching and deduplication for instance, could be automated by making a ML model 'learn' and predict the matches routinely. Data integration can also benefit from ML as the data to be integrated can be sampled and used to design the data integration algorithms. After the initial manual work to setup the labels, ML models can start learning from the new incoming data that are being submitted for standardization, integration, and cleaning. The more data supplied to the model, the better the ML algorithm can perform and deliver accurate results. Therefore, ML is more scalable compared to traditional and time-consuming approaches. Nevertheless, many ML algorithms require an out-of-The-box tuning and their parameters and scope are often not adapted to the problem at hand. To make an example, in cleaning and integration processes, the window sizes of values used for the ML models cannot be arbitrarily chosen and require an adaptation of the learning parameters. This tutorial will survey the recent trend of applying machine learning solutions to improve data management tasks and establish new paradigms to sharpen data error detection, cleaning, and integration at the data instance level, as well as at schema, system, and user levels.  2018 IEEE.","Laure, Berti-Equille; Angela, Bonifati; Tova, Milo",10.1109/ICDE.2018.00226,conferencePaper,S3BDIXSU,2018,,1

Infrared Image Segmentation for Photovoltaic Panels Based on Res-UNet,NO,,,,"Infrared image segmentation is the basis of error detection for photovoltaic panels. In this work, the infrared image data are collected by infrared thermal imager from the view of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A semantic segmentation neural network named Deep Res-UNet, which combines the strengths of residual learning, transfer learning, and U-Net, is proposed for infrared image segmentation. Residual units are applied in both the encoding and decoding path, which makes the whole deep network ease to train. A modified ResNet-34 with pre-trained weights is utilized to get better feature representation. In the modified ResNet-34, maxpooling layer is removed for reducing the loss in resolution, an additional conv1 stage is added to copy features for the corresponding decoding path and the skip block with dilated residual block is added to generate features with larger resolution and larger receptive field. A new loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice is proposed to get better results. Additionally, Conditional Random Field (CRF) is integrated into the model as a post-process. The experimental results show that the prediction results of the proposed model are 97.11% and 94.47% respectively on the two evaluation indexes of F1 and Jaccard index, which is better than FCN-8s, SegNet, U-Net and two descendants of U-Net and ResNet: ResUnet and ResNet34-Unet.",Hao Zhang; Xianggong Hong; Shifen Zhou; Qingcai Wang,10.1007/978-3-030-31654-9_52,journalArticle,2FRVJXL5,2019,,1

Reinforcement Learning for Data Preparation with Active Reward Learning,YES,,,,"Data cleaning and data preparation have been long-standing challenges in data science to avoid incorrect results, biases, and misleading conclusions obtained from ""dirty"" data. For a given dataset and data analytics task, a plethora of data preprocessing techniques and alternative data cleaning strategies are available, but they may lead to dramatically different outputs with unequal result quality performances. For adequate data preparation, the users generally do not know how to start with or which methods to use. Most current work can be classified into two categories: (1) they propose new data cleaning algorithms specific to certain types of data anomalies usually considered in isolation and without a ""pipeline vision"" of the entire data preprocessing strategy; (2) they develop automated machine learning approaches (AutoML) that can optimize the hyper-parameters of a considered ML model with a list of by-default preprocessing methods. We argue that more efforts should be devoted to proposing a principled and adaptive data preparation approach to help and learn from the user for selecting the optimal sequence of data preparation tasks to obtain the best quality performance of the final result. In this paper, we extend Learn2Clean, a method based on Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that selects, for a given dataset, a given ML model, and a preselected quality performance metric, the optimal sequence of tasks for preprocessing the data such that the quality metric is maximized. We will discuss some new results of Learn2Clean for semi-automating data preparation with ""the human in the loop"" using active reward learning and Q-learning.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Berti-Equille, Laure",10.1007/978-3-030-34770-3_10,journalArticle,26KVTFEX,2019,aug,1

PClean: Bayesian data cleaning at scale with domain-specific probabilistic programming,YES,,,,"Data cleaning is naturally framed as probabilistic inference in a generative model, combining a prior distribution over ground-truth databases with a likelihood that models the noisy channel by which the data are filtered, corrupted, and joined to yield incomplete, dirty, and denormalized datasets. Based on this view, we present PClean, a unified generative modeling architecture for cleaning and normalizing dirty data in diverse domains. Given an unclean dataset and a probabilistic program encoding relevant domain knowledge, PClean learns a structured representation of the data as a relational database of interrelated objects, and uses this latent structure to impute missing values, identify duplicates, detect errors, and propose corrections in the original data table. PClean makes three modeling and inference contributions: (i) a domain-general non-parametric generative model of relational data, for inferring latent objects and their network of latent connections; (ii) a domain-specific probabilistic programming language, for encoding domain knowledge specific to each dataset being cleaned; and (iii) a domain-general inference engine that adapts to each PClean program by constructing data-driven proposals used in sequential Monte Carlo and particle Gibbs. We show empirically that short ( 50-line) PClean programs deliver higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data cleaning systems based on machine learning and weighted logic; that PCleans inference algorithm is faster than generic particle Gibbs inference for probabilistic programs; and that PClean scales to large real-world datasets with millions of rows.

Efficient Medical Image Parsing,NO,,,,"Fast and robust detection, segmentation and tracking of anatomical structures or pathologies support the entire clinical workflow enabling real-time guidance, quantification, and processing in the operating room. Most state-of-the-art solutions for parsing medical images are based on machine learning methods. While this enables the effective use of large annotated image databases, such techniques typically suffer from inherent limitations related to the efficiency in scanning high-dimensional parametric spaces and the learning of representative features for modeling the object appearance. In this context we present Marginal Space Deep Learning, a novel framework for volumetric image parsing which exploits both the strengths of efficient object parametrization in hierarchical marginal spaces and the representational power of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The system learns classifiers in clustered, high-probability regions of the parameter space capturing the appearance of the object under the considered pose transformations and shape variations, gradually increasing the dimensionality of the exploration space from translation (3D), translation-orientation (6D) to incorporating also the anisotropic scaling (9D) and shape variability (ND). During runtime the system uses the learned classifiers to exhaustively scan these spaces to select the most probable transformation parameters. As this implies a significant computational effort in the order of billions of scanning hypotheses we propose cascaded sparse adaptive neural networks, learning to focus the data sampling patterns of the networks on sparse, context-rich parts of the input, thereby considerably reducing the runtime and increasing the robustness of the system. While we show that this method significantly increases the performance of the state-of-the-art, we highlight its main limitation: the learning of the appearance model and the parameter scanning are completely decoupled as independent algorithmic steps. To address this we make a step toward human-like intelligent parsing, presenting an extension of the system that models the object appearance and the parameter search as a unified behavioral task for an artificial agent. As opposed to exhaustively scanning the parameter space, the system uses reinforcement learning to discover optimal navigation paths guiding the search to the optimal location. We show the initial performance of this approach on the detection of arbitrary landmarks in ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and computed tomography data, with considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our future work is focused on extending this framework for generic image parsing.  2017 Elsevier Inc.

DCNN Based Dual Assurance Model for Age Estimation by Analyzing Facial Images,NO,,,,"Advancement in Machine Learning (ML) with improved computing power and large facial image dataset have inspired a lot of research to estimate the age using facial images. These research have also showcased superiority of deeply learned neural networks on large datasets for estimating age. The proposed method utilises the implementation of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) using a pre-trained model. It estimates the age using two components called MotherNet (M-Net) and ChildNets (C-Net) which employs a novel dual assurance approach to not only detect but also correct the error in age estimation. Inturn, this strategy improves the overall performance. Experiments have been conducted on two datasets: FG-NET and Chalearn-15. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.","Shah, Z.; Roy, M.",10.1109/INDICON49873.2020.9342365,conferencePaper,WWQT6TXD,2020,,1
An adaptive machine learning approach to improve automatic iceberg detection from SAR images,NO,,,,"Iceberg distribution, dispersion and melting patterns are fundamental aspects in the balance of heat and freshwater in the Southern Ocean; yet these features are not fully understood. This lack of understanding is, in part, due to the difficulties in accurately identifying icebergs in different environmental conditions. To improve the understanding, reliable iceberg detection tools are necessary to achieve a detailed picture of iceberg drift and disintegration patterns, an thus to gain further information on the freshwater input into the Southern Ocean. Here, we present an accurate automatic large-scale iceberg detection method using an alternative machine learning architecture applied to high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Our method is based on the concept of adaptability and focuses on improving the performance of identifying icebergs in ambiguous environmental contexts with wide radiometric, textural, size and shape variability. The fundamentals of the method are centred on superpixel segmentation, ensemble learning and incremental learning. The method is applied to a dataset containing 586 ENVISAT Advanced SAR images acquired during 20032005 (Weddell Sea region) and to the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) mosaic, covering the Antarctic wide near-coastal zone. These images cover scenes under heterogenous backscattering signatures for all seasons with variable meteorological, oceanographic and acquisition parameters (e.g. band, polarization). Our method is highly adaptable to distinguish icebergs from ambiguous objects hidden in the images. The average false positive rate and miss rate are 2.3  0.4% and 3.3  0.4%, respectively. Overall, 9512 icebergs with sizes varying from 0.1 to 4567.82 km2 are detected with average classification accuracy of 97.5  0.6%. The results confirm that the method presented here is robust for widespread iceberg detection in the Antarctic seas.  2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Attention-Based Cross-Modality Feature Complementation for Multispectral Pedestrian Detection,NO,,,,"Multispectral pedestrian detection based on deep learning can provide a robust and accurate detection under different illumination conditions, which has important research significance in safety. In order to reduce the log-average miss rate of the object under different illumination conditions, a new one-stage detector suitable for multispectral pedestrian detection is proposed. First, in order to realize the complementarity between the information flows of the two modalities in the feature extraction stage to reduce the object loss, a low-cost cross-modality feature complementary module (CFCM) is proposed. Second, in order to suppress the background noise in different environments and enhance the semantic information and location information of the object, so as to reduce the error detection of the object, an attention-based feature enhancement fusion module (AFEFM) is proposed. Thirdly, through the feature complementarity of color-thermal image pair and the multi-scale fusion of depth feature layer, the horizontal and vertical multi-dimensional data mining of parallel deep neural network is realized, which provides effective data support for object detection algorithm. Finally, through the reasonable arrangement of proposed modules, a robust multispectral detection framework is proposed. The experimental results on the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) pedestrian benchmark show that the proposed method has the lowest log-average miss rate compared with other state-of-the-art multispectral pedestrian detectors, and has a good balance in speed and accuracy.  2013 IEEE.","Jiang, Qunyan; Dai, Juying; Rui, Ting; Shao, Faming; Wang, Jinkang; Lu, Guanlin",10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3175303,journalArticle,SPRSZKTB,2022,,1
Chromium-laced medical capsules detection based on hyperspectral imaging technology,NO,,,,"Medicinal gelatin hollow hard capsule has been widely used in people's daily life, but the toxic capsule event has drew public concern on its safety issue in 2012, since the casings were made with an industrial gelatin with high amounts of metal chromium. In this paper, the traditional method, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was used for detecting medicinal gelation hollow hard capsule as a control group; then hyperspectral image was used for detecting 347 normal capsule samples and 701 toxic capsule samples, which were analyzed and discussed from different image bands and regions of interest (ROIs). At the beginning, hyperspectral processing was used for dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, and then two kinds of capsules spectral data were obtained to do qualitative analysis according to ROIs. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis(PLS-DA) and Principal Component Analysis- Artificial Neural Network(PCA-ANN) were used to identify Chromium-laced capsule based on spectral data processing, of which 60% sample are used for modeling, the remaining 40% are used for predicting. In the end, we can draw a conclusion that if chosen 4 Latent Variables (LVs) as input features in the PLSDA model, high classification accuracy would be achieved, with the accuracy of 100%. The correlation coefficient of cross validation and sample prediction are 0.923 and 0.972 respectively; sensitivity and specificity are 100% as well. The result prove that it is feasible to use hyperspectral data for chromium-laced capsule qualitative analysis, the method greatly reduces the complexity of the traditional detection and try to provide a new thought in chromium detection of capsule.  2016, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

Classification of bifurcations regions in IVOCT images using support vector machine and artificial neural network models,NO,,,,"Studies in intravascular optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT) have demonstrated the importance of coronary bifurcation regions in intravascular medical imaging analysis, as plaques are more likely to accumulate in this region leading to coronary disease. A typical IV-OCT pullback acquires hundreds of frames, thus developing an automated tool to classify the OCT frames as bifurcation or non-bifurcation can be an important step to speed up OCT pullbacks analysis and assist automated methods for atherosclerotic plaque quantification. In this work, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art classifiers, SVM and Neural Networks in the bifurcation classification task. The study included IV-OCT frames from 9 patients. In order to improve classification performance, we trained and tested the SVM with different parameters by means of a grid search and different stop criteria were applied to the Neural Network classifier: mean square error, early stop and regularization. Different sets of features were tested, using feature selection techniques: PCA, LDA and scalar feature selection with correlation. Training and test were performed in sets with a maximum of 1460 OCT frames. We quantified our results in terms of false positive rate, true positive rate, accuracy, specificity, precision, false alarm, f-measure and area under ROC curve. Neural networks obtained the best classification accuracy, 98.83%, overcoming the results found in literature. Our methods appear to offer a robust and reliable automated classification of OCT frames that might assist physicians indicating potential frames to analyze.

Droplet deposition characteristics detection method based on deep learning,NO,,,,"Accurate acquisition of spraying quality parameters of plant protection Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is helpful to analyze the deposition and distribution of pesticides in field crops. It is of great significance for pest control. UAV spray quality detection system was used to collect droplets, the droplet deposition parameters can be detected by processing the droplet images. However, the spots and the adhesion of the droplets led to large data errors. In order to solve this problem, this paper developed a recognition method of adhesive droplets based on Deeplab V3 + deep learning network, and a concave point matching segmentation algorithm based on convolutional neural network was designed to segment adhesion droplets. Used water instead of pesticides to spray to verify the detection effect of the above method. The test results showed that this method was accurate in the identification and extraction of droplets in the detection of droplet coverage. Compared with the droplet coverage measured by Deposit scan, the average relative error is 3.81%. Compared with the manual counting method, the detection error of the droplet deposition density was 3.17%. It was better for the segmentation of adhesion droplets.

Peduncle Detection of Sweet Pepper for Autonomous Crop Harvesting - Combined Colour and 3D Information,NO,,,,"This paper presents a 3D visual detection method for the challenging task of detecting peduncles of sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum) in the field. Cutting the peduncle cleanly is one of the most difficult stages of the harvesting process, where the peduncle is the part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant. Accurate peduncle detection in 3D space is therefore a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated using qualitative and quantitative results (the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of the detection precision-recall curve). We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers. We release a set of manually annotated 3D sweet pepper and peduncle images to assist the research community in performing further research on this topic. Copyright  2017, The Authors.

A deep learning model of automatic detection of pulmonary nodules based on convolution neural networks (CNNs),NO,,,,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as one of the most classic representatives supervised deep learning, has been widely used for pedestrian tracking, voice recognition and image recognition.

Firstly, the original CT images obtained lung parenchyma segmentation images through region growing and the images are stored into the sample library. Because CNNs can automatically learn image features, next, select the samples directly to train and test user-defined PndCnn- 7 model, making it possible to detect pulmonary nodules accurately.

Text-dependent speech enhancement for small-footprint robust keyword detection,NO,,,,"Keyword detection (KWD), also known as keyword spotting, is in great demand in small devices in the era of Internet of Things. Albeit recent progresses, the performance of KWD, measured in terms of precision and recall rate, may still degrade significantly when either the non-speech ambient noises or the human voice and speech-like interferences (e. g., TV, background competing talkers) exists. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address all kinds of environmental interferences. A novel text-dependent speech enhancement (TDSE) technique using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) is presented for improving the robustness of the small-footprint KWD task in the presence of environmental noises and interfering talkers. On our large simulated and recorded noisy and far-field evaluation sets, we show that TDSE significantly improves the quality of the target keyword speech and performs particularly well under speech interference conditions. We demonstrate that KWD with TDSE frontend significantly outperforms the baseline KWD system with or without a generic speech enhancement in terms of equal error rate (EER) in the keyword detection evaluation.  2018 International Speech Communication Association.

A Deep Convolutional Deblurring and Detection Neural Network for Localizing Text in Videos,NO,,,,"Scene text in the video is usually vulnerable to various blurs like those caused by camera or text motions, which brings additional difficulty to reliably extract them from the video for content-based video applications. In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional deep neural network for deblurring and detecting text in the video. Specifically, to cope with blur of video text, we propose an effective deblurring subnetwork that is composed of multi-level convolutional blocks with both cross-block (long) and within-block (short) skip connections for progressively learning residual deblurred image details as well as a spatial attention mechanism to pay more attention on blurred regions, which generates the sharper image for current frame by fusing multiple surrounding adjacent frames. To further localize text in the frames, we enhance the EAST text detection model by introducing deformable convolution layers and deconvolution layers, which better capture widely varied appearances of video text.

Multitask Cascade Convolution Neural Networks for Automatic Thyroid Nodule Detection and Recognition,NO,,,,"Thyroid ultrasonography is a widely used clinical technique for nodule diagnosis in thyroid regions. However, it remains difficult to detect and recognize the nodules due to low contrast, high noise, and diverse appearance of nodules. In today's clinical practice, senior doctors could pinpoint nodules by analyzing global context features, local geometry structure, and intensity changes, which would require rich clinical experience accumulated from hundreds and thousands of nodule case studies. To alleviate doctors' tremendous labor in the diagnosis procedure, we advocate a machine learning approach to the detection and recognition tasks in this paper. In particular, we develop a multitask cascade convolution neural network (MC-CNN) framework to exploit the context information of thyroid nodules. It may be noted that our framework is built upon a large number of clinically confirmed thyroid ultrasound images with accurate and detailed ground truth labels. Other key advantages of our framework result from a multitask cascade architecture, two stages of carefully designed deep convolution networks in order to detect and recognize thyroid nodules in a pyramidal fashion, and capturing various intrinsic features in a global-to-local way. Within our framework, the potential regions of interest after initial detection are further fed to the spatial pyramid augmented CNNs to embed multiscale discriminative information for fine-grained thyroid recognition. Experimental results on 4309 clinical ultrasound images have indicated that our MC-CNN is accurate and effective for both thyroid nodules detection and recognition. For the correct diagnosis rate of malignant and benign thyroid nodules, its mean Average Precision (mAP) performance can achieve up to 98.2 accuracy, which outperforms the common CNNs by 5 on average. In addition, we conduct rigorous user studies to confirm that our MC-CNN outperforms experienced doctors, yet only consuming roughly 2 (1/48) of doctors' examination time on average. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of our new method exhibit its great potential in clinical applications.  2013 IEEE.","Song, Wenfeng; Li, Shuai; Liu, Ji; Qin, Hong; Zhang, Bo; Zhang, Shuyang; Hao, Aimin",10.1109/JBHI.2018.2852718,journalArticle,RTJLQ458,2019,,1
Salient object detection method using random graph,NO,,,,"In this paper, a bottom-up salient object detection method is proposed by modeling image as a random graph. The proposed method starts with portioning input image into superpixels and extracting color and spatial features for each superpixel. Then, a complete graph is constructed by employing superpixels as nodes. A high edge weight is assigned into a pair of superpixels if they have high similarity. Next, a random walk prior on nodes is assumed to generate the probability distribution on edges. On the other hand, a complete directed graph is created that each edge weight represents the probability for transmitting random walker from current node to next node. By considering a threshold and eliminating edges with higher probability than the threshold, a random graph is created to model input image. The inbound degree vector of a random graph is computed to determine the most salient nodes (regions). Finally, a propagation technique is used to form saliency map.

Pupil detection and tracking for AR 3D under various circumstances,NO,,,,"Accurate pupil position detection and tracking of a driver plays an important role and is a prerequisite for augmented reality 3-dimensional head-up display (AR 3D HUD) systems of a vehicle. This paper aims to develop a robust, automated algorithm and system for detection and tracking of pupil centers of a user using a single visual camera and near-infrared (NIR) leds under dynamic driving circumstances. Our proposed pupil tracker consists of eye-nose detection, keypoint alignment, and tracking with NIR led on/off control depending on illumination conditions. Eye-nose detection, which utilizes an error reinforcement learning method for selecting best learning DB, generates facial sub-region boxes including eyes and nose. The error reinforcement learning method uses only a small fraction (less than 5%) of the training DB, while improving the detection rate. Based on the detected region, eye-nose alignment including pupil centers are then processed by Supervised Descent Method (SDM) with Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Then, the pupil centers are tracked with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and SIFT feature based tracking checker, which guarantees the aligned results contains pupil centers. This can be considered a different feature space and a strong classifier used in the eye-nose detection stage, such as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and a set of weak classifiers (Adaboosting). However, the proposed pupil tracker cannot be applied under low light conditions. To achieve this, we add NIR leds and S/W functions to control the intensity of the NIR. After recognizing the contents of the pupil image, such as low light conditions, wearing eyeglasses or sunglasses, corresponding designated aligners are applied.

Moreover, the entire error correction virtually always delivers the performance of the best non-attacked network, resulting in an mIoU of about 50% even under strongest attacks (instead of 1...2%), while keeping the performance on clean data at about original level (ca. 75.7%).","Bar, A.; Klingner, M.; Varghese, S.; Huger, F.; Schlicht, P.; Fingscheidt, T.",10.1109/CVPRW50498.2020.00174,conferencePaper,37S3GMMM,2020,,1

Most of the previous state-of-The-Art methods were lack of ability in capturing features in long range. Recent methods applied dependency tree via dependency-bridge and attention-based graph. However, most of the automatic processing tools used in those methods show poor performance on Chinese texts due to mismatching between word segmentation and labels, which results in error propagation. In this article, we propose a novel character-level Chinese event extraction framework via graph attention network (CAEE). We build our model upon the sequence labeling model, but enhance it with word information by incorporating the word lexicon into the character representations. We further exploit the inter-dependencies between event triggers and argument by building a word-character-based graph network via syntactic shortcut arcs with dependency-parsing. The architecture of the graph minimizes error propagation, which is the result of the error detection of the word boundaries in the processing of Chinese texts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, we build a large-scale real-world corpus consisting of announcements of Chinese financial news without golden entities. Experiments on the corpus show that our approach achieves competitive results compared with previous work in the field of Chinese texts.  2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","Wu, Xiaohua; Wang, Tengrui; Fan, Youping; Yu, Fangjian",10.1145/3494533,journalArticle,WMD5L2SF,2022,,1
High-precision piston detection method for segments based on a single convolutional neural network,NO,,,,"High-precision detection of piston error is one of the key technologies for high-resolution large-aperture segmented telescopes. Most piston detection methods based on neural networks are difficult to achieve high accuracy. In this Letter, we propose a high-precision piston error detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). A system with six sub-mirrors is used, and one of the sub-mirrors is set as the reference mirror. The network can simultaneously extract the piston information of the remaining five sub-mirrors to be tested from the point spread function (PSF). In the training phase, five sub-mirrors are set with 10,000 groups of random piston values with a range slightly less than one wavelength, and PSF images can be acquired accordingly. Then, 10,000 PSF images with corresponding piston errors are used to train the network. After training, we only need to input a PSF image into the pre-trained network, and the piston can be obtained directly. It is verified by simulation that the average piston's measurement error of five submirrors is just 0.0089 RMS (=632nm). In addition, this end-to-end method based on deep learning extremely reduces the complexity of the optical system, and just need to set a mask with a sparse multi-subaperture configuration in the conjugate plane of the segmented mirror. This method is accurate and fast, and can be widely used to detect the piston in phasing telescope arrays or segmented mirrors.  2021 SPIE","Wang, Hao; Zhao, Weirui; Zhang, Lu",10.1117/12.2587641,conferencePaper,W73YNM96,2021,,1

Deep learning based vehicle make-model classification,NO,,,,"This paper studies the problem of vehicle make & model classification. Some of the main challenges are reaching high classification accuracy and reducing the annotation time of the images. To address these problems, we have created a fine-grained database using online vehicle marketplaces of Turkey. A pipeline is proposed to combine an SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model with a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to train on the database. In the pipeline, we first detect the vehicles by following an algorithm which reduces the time for annotation. Then, we feed them into the CNN model. It is reached approximately 4% better classification accuracy result than using a conventional CNN model. Next, we propose to use the detected vehicles as ground truth bounding box (GTBB) of the images and feed them into an SSD model in another pipeline. At this stage, it is reached reasonable classification accuracy result without using perfectly shaped GTBB.

READ: Aggregating Reconstruction Error into Out-of-distribution Detection,YES,,,,"Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial to the safe deployment of a classifier in the real world. However, deep neural networks are known to be overconfident for abnormal data. Existing works directly design score function by mining the inconsistency from classifier for in-distribution (ID) and OOD. In this paper, we further complement this inconsistency with reconstruction error, based on the assumption that an autoencoder trained on ID data can not reconstruct OOD as well as ID. We propose a novel method, READ (Reconstruction Error Aggregated Detector), to unify inconsistencies from classifier and autoencoder. Specifically, the reconstruction error of raw pixels is transformed to latent space of classifier. We show that the transformed reconstruction error bridges the semantic gap and inherits detection performance from the original. Moreover, we propose an adjustment strategy to alleviate the overconfidence problem of autoencoder according to a fine-grained characterization of OOD data. Under two scenarios of pre-training and retraining, we respectively present two variants of our method, namely READ-MD (Mahalanobis Distance) only based on pre-trained classifier and READ-ED (Euclidean Distance) which retrains the classifier. Our methods do not require access to test time OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection algorithms.

Non-Halal Ingredients Detection of Food Packaging Image Using Convolutional Neural Networks,NO,,,,"Halal food is absolute for Muslims. Unfortunately, many packaged foods have not been certified halal. One way of looking at the ingredients is listed. However, often the code of composition is unfamiliar.

The development supports this and using Android smartphones. However, it is often constrained by the size of the font and position of packaged foods uneven.

An Improved YOLOv3-based Neural Network for De-identification Technology,NO,,,,"In this paper, we proposed an improved YOLOv3-based neural network for De-identification technology. The existing YOLOv3 is a network with fast speed and performance recently. Most surveillance system using CCD cameras simultaneously store images from cameras installed in multiple locations. In such an environment, the use of deep learning requires a method of detecting objects through a single inference engine in a plurality of image. If the inference engine hardware is used for each camera channel, the cost of building a surveillance system increases significantly. Therefore, in the field of surveillance systems, a network structure with a high detection speed is required even if the detection performance is slightly degraded. This paper proposes a method to increase the detection speed by reducing the existing YOLOv3 network Architecture. 53 feature extractors, Darknet-53, are reduced to 24 layers. Therefore, a total of 106 layers is reduced to 39. And 53 YOLOv3 box detection parts are reduced to 15 layers. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the WIDER FACE dataset and its own collected dataset, we compared the performance with the existing YOLOv3-tiny and YOLOv3. As a result, the result was 87.48% mAP improved by 19.55% compared to the conventional YOLOv3-tiny. And I got a slow result of 100.5 FPS speed than the existing speed. And Object De-identification technology has been applied according to the results of the detection box. Therefore, it is faster than YOLOv3, and it is similar to YOLOv3 detection accuracy, proving that it is better than YOLOv3-tiny in real time detection.  2019 IEEE.","Won, Ji-Hun; Lee, Dong-Hyun; Lee, Kyung-Min; Lin, Chi-Ho",10.1109/ITC-CSCC.2019.8793382,conferencePaper,TK7RYQY9,2019,,1
Multi-level supervision and modification of artificial pancreas control system,NO,,,,"Artificial pancreas (AP) systems provide automated regulation of blood glucose concentration (BGC) for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). An AP includes three components: a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, a controller calculating insulin infusion rate based on the CGM signal, and a pump delivering the insulin amount calculated by the controller to the patient. The performance of the AP system depends on successful operation of these three components. Many APs use model predictive controllers that rely on models to predict BGC and to calculate the optimal insulin infusion rate. The performance of model-based controllers depends on the accuracy of the models that is affected by large dynamic changes in glucose-insulin metabolism or equipment performance that may move the operating conditions away from those used in developing the models and designing the control system. Sensor errors and missing signals will cause calculation of erroneous insulin infusion rates. And the performance of the controller may vary at each sampling step and each period (meal, exercise, and sleep), and from day to day. Here we describe a multi-level supervision and controller modification (ML-SCM) module is developed to supervise the performance of the AP system and retune the controller. It supervises AP performance in 3 time windows: sample level, period level, and day level. At sample level, an online controller performance assessment sub-module will generate controller performance indexes to evaluate various components of the AP system and conservatively modify the controller. A sensor error detection and signal reconciliation module will detect sensor error and reconcile the CGM sensor signal at each sample. At period level, the controller performance is evaluated with information collected during a certain time period and the controller is tuned more aggressively. At the day level, the daily CGM ranges are further analyzed to determine the adjustable range of controller parameters used for sample level and period level. Thirty subjects in the UVa/Padova metabolic simulator were used to evaluate the performance of the ML-SCM module and one clinical experiment is used to illustrate its performance in a clinical environment. The results indicate that the AP system with an ML-SCM module has a safer range of glucose concentration distribution and more appropriate insulin infusion rate suggestions than an AP system without the ML-SCM module.","Feng, Jianyuan; Hajizadeh, Iman; Yu, Xia; Rashid, Mudassir; Turksoy, Kamuran; Samadi, Sediqeh; Sevil, Mert; Hobbs, Nicole; Brandt, Rachel; Lazaro, Caterina; Maloney, Zacharie; Littlejohn, Elizabeth; Philipson, Louis H.; Cinar, Ali",10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.02.002,journalArticle,4PWTDHHT,2018,,1
A Deep Learning Approach for Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Detection and Lymphoma Multi-Classification in Histological Images,NO,,,,"Accurately identifying and categorizing cancer structures/sub-types in histological images is an important clinical task involving a considerable workload and a specific subspecialty of pathologists. Digitizing pathology is a current trend that provides large amounts of visual data allowing a faster and more precise diagnosis through the development of automatic image analysis techniques. Recent studies have shown promising results for the automatic analysis of cancer tissue by using deep learning strategies that automatically extract and organize the discriminative information from the data. This paper explores deep learning methods for the automatic analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin stained histological images of breast cancer and lymphoma. In particular, a deep learning approach is proposed for two different use cases: the detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in breast histological images and the classification of lymphoma sub-types. Both use cases have been addressed by adopting a residual convolutional neural network that is part of a convolutional autoencoder network (i.e., FusionNet). The performances have been evaluated on the public datasets of digital histological images and have been compared with those obtained by using different deep neural networks (UNet and ResNet). Additionally, comparisons with the state of the art have been considered, in accordance with different deep learning approaches.

FT-CNN: Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance for Convolutional Neural Networks,NO,,,,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming more and more important for solving challenging and critical problems in many fields. CNN inference applications have been deployed in safety-critical systems, which may suffer from soft errors caused by high-energy particles, high temperature, or abnormal voltage. Of critical importance is ensuring the stability of the CNN inference process against soft errors. Traditional fault tolerance methods are not suitable for CNN inference because error-correcting code is unable to protect computational components, instruction duplication techniques incur high overhead, and existing algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques cannot protect all convolution implementations. In this article, we focus on how to protect the CNN inference process against soft errors as efficiently as possible, with the following three contributions. (1) We propose several systematic ABFTschemes based on checksum techniques and analyze their fault protection ability and runtime thoroughly. Unlike traditional ABFT based on matrix-matrix multiplication, our schemes support any convolution implementations. (2) We design a novel workflow integrating all the proposed schemes to obtain a high detection/correction ability with limited total runtime overhead. (3) We perform our evaluation using ImageNet with well-known CNN models including AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-18, and YOLOv2.

A Novel Detection System for Human Retina Based on Fuzzification Neural Network,NO,,,,"Automated methods are based on human biometrics for the purpose of verifying a persons identity based on the physiological or behavioural features of humans.

Using deep convolutional neural network architectures for object classification and detection within x-ray baggage security imagery,NO,,,,"We consider the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning for the image classification and detection problems posed within the context of X-ray baggage security imagery. The use of the CNN approach requires large amounts of data to facilitate a complex end-to-end feature extraction and classification process. Within the context of X-ray security screening, limited availability of object of interest data examples can thus pose a problem. To overcome this issue, we employ a transfer learning paradigm such that a pre-trained CNN, primarily trained for generalized image classification tasks where sufficient training data exists, can be optimized explicitly as a later secondary process towards this application domain. To provide a consistent feature-space comparison between this approach and traditional feature space representations, we also train support vector machine (SVM) classifier on CNN features. We empirically show that fine-tuned CNN features yield superior performance to conventional hand-crafted features on object classification tasks within this context. Overall we achieve 0.994 accuracy based on AlexNet features trained with SVM classifier. In addition to classification, we also explore the applicability of multiple CNN driven detection paradigms, such as sliding window-based CNN (SW-CNN), Faster region-based CNNs (F-RCNNs), region-based fully convolutional networks (R-FCN), and YOLOv2. We train numerous networks tackling both single and multiple detections over SW-CNN/F-RCNN/R-FCN/YOLOv2 variants. YOLOv2, Faster-RCNN, and R-FCN provide superior results to the more traditional SW-CNN approaches. With the use of YOLOv2, using input images of size 544  544, we achieve 0.885 mean average precision (mAP) for a six-class object detection problem. The same approach with an input of size 416  416 yields 0.974 mAP for the two-class firearm detection problem and requires approximately 100 ms per image.

Accountable Error Characterization [arXiv],NO,,,,"Customers of machine learning systems demand accountability from the companies employing these algorithms for various prediction tasks. Accountability requires understanding of system limit and condition of erroneous predictions, as customers are often interested in understanding the incorrect predictions, and model developers are absorbed in finding methods that can be used to get incremental improvements to an existing system. Therefore, we propose an accountable error characterization method, AEC, to understand when and where errors occur within the existing black-box models. AEC, as constructed with human-understandable linguistic features, allows the model developers to automatically identify the main sources of errors for a given classification system. It can also be used to sample for the set of most informative input points for a next round of training. We perform error detection for a sentiment analysis task using AEC as a case study. Our results on the sample sentiment task show that AEC is able to characterize erroneous predictions into human understandable categories and also achieves promising results on selecting erroneous samples when compared with the uncertainty-based sampling.","Misra, A.; Zhe Liu; Mahmud, J.",,journalArticle,QM3EF4EK,2021,,1

A Benchmark Study of Backdoor Data Poisoning Defenses for Deep Neural Network Classifiers and A Novel Defense,related,,,,"While data poisoning attacks on classifiers were originally proposed to degrade a classifier's usability, there has been strong recent interest in backdoor data poisoning attacks, where the classifier learns to classify to a target class whenever a backdoor pattern (e.g., a watermark or innocuous pattern) is added to an example from some class other than the target class. In this paper, we conduct a benchmark experimental study to assess the effectiveness of backdoor attacks against deep neural network (DNN) classifiers for images (CIFAR-10 domain), as well as of anomaly detection defenses against these attacks, assuming the defender has access to the (poisoned) training set. We also propose a novel defense scheme (cluster impurity (CI)) based on two ideas: I) backdoor patterns may cluster in a DNN's (e.g. penultimate) deep layer latent space; ii) image filtering (or additive noise) may remove the backdoor patterns, and thus alter the class decision produced by the DNN. We demonstrate that largely imperceptible single-pixel backdoor attacks are highly successful, with no effect on classifier usability. However, the CI approach is highly effective at detecting these attacks, and more successful than previous backdoor detection methods.  2019 IEEE.","Xiang, Zhen; Miller, David J.; Kesidis, George",10.1109/MLSP.2019.8918908,conferencePaper,BTIL6MMY,2019,aug,1
Band segmentation and detection of DNA by using fast fuzzy C-mean and neuro adaptive fuzzy inference system,NO,,,,"Currently, band segmentation is used in medical science, because it helps the scientist to detect and calculate the band and line respectively. Segmentation is very important in medical images, because it provides the clinical assistance to physician. Such as, the DNA images are used to detect and segment the bands and line and calculate the local minima and maxima. For segmentation, we use Fast Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering (FFCM). FFCM is a clustering method that allows a piece of data to be in two or more clusters. Clustering involves the task of dividing the data points into homogeneous classes or the clusters, so that items in the same class are as equitable as possible and the items in the different classes are different.

Sea Surface Target Detection for RD Images of HFSWR Based on Optimized Error Self-adjustment Extreme Learning Machine,NO,,,,"High-frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR) has been widely applied in ship targets detection and tracking beyond the line-of-sight limitation. However, the detection background of HFSWR is completely complex, in which the ship targets usually polluted by all kinds of noises. In this paper, a novel ship target detection method based on optimized error self-adjustment extreme learning machine (OES-ELM) for RD images of HFSWR is presented. Through the application of two-stage cascade classification strategy, the proposed approach can impressively increase the detection efficiency in real time. Firstly, gray-scale feature and a linear classifier are adopted to obtain the target candidate areas. Then, Haar-like features and a optimized ELM are proposed to identify ship targets from precisely. In the proposed OES-ELM, the sparse solution of output weights is found by L1/2 regularizer process, in which the optimal hidden neurons can be obtained by pruning the ""weak"" nodes. In addition, both the output and hidden weights are updated to optimal value by pulling back the output error to the hidden layer. Experimental results show that the proposed OES-ELM has better generalization performance. Furthermore, the proposed method has favorable real time and target detection performance.

Fast words boundaries localization in text fields for low quality document images,NO,,,,"The paper examines the problem of word boundaries precise localization in document text zones. Document processing on a mobile device consists of document localization, perspective correction, localization of individual fields, finding words in separate zones, segmentation and recognition. While capturing an image with a mobile digital camera under uncontrolled capturing conditions, digital noise, perspective distortions or glares may occur. Further document processing gets complicated because of its specifics: layout elements, complex background, static text, document security elements, variety of text fonts. However, the problem of word boundaries localization has to be solved at runtime on mobile CPU with limited computing capabilities under specified restrictions. At the moment, there are several groups of methods optimized for different conditions. Methods for the scanned printed text are quick but limited only for images of high quality. Methods for text in the wild have an excessively high computational complexity, thus, are hardly suitable for running on mobile devices as part of the mobile document recognition system. The method presented in this paper solves a more specialized problem than the task of finding text on natural images. It uses local features, a sliding window and a lightweight neural network in order to achieve an optimal algorithm speed-precision ratio. The duration of the algorithm is 12 ms per field running on an ARM processor of a mobile device.

JPEG steganalysis with combined dense connected CNNs and SCA-GFR,NO,,,,"The detection of weakly hidden information in a JPEG compressed image is challenging. In this paper, we propose a 32-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) involving feature reuse by concatenating all features from previous layers. The proposed method can improve the flow of gradient, and the sharing of features and bottleneck layers can also dramatically reduce the number of parameters in the proposed CNN model. To further improve the detection accuracy and combine the directional features from the selection-channel-aware Gabor filtering residual (SCA-GFR) method with Gabor filtering and non-directional feature maps from the CNN model, an ensemble architecture called CNN-SCA-GFR is used, which combines the proposed CNN method with the conventional SCA-GFR method to detect J-UNIWARD and UERD. This can significantly reduce the detection error rate to below that of the existing JPEG steganalysis methods. For example, in the detection of J-UNIWARD at 0.1 bpnzAC, the detection error rate using our proposed method is 5.67% lower than that achieved by XuNet, and 7.89% lower than that achieved by the conventional SCA-GFR method. When detecting UERD at 0.1 bpnzAC, the detection error rate using our proposed method is 5.94% lower than that achieved by XuNet, and 10.28% lower than that achieved by the conventional SCA-GFR method.  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Yang, Jianhua; Kang, Xiangui; Wong, Edward K.; Shi, Yun-Qing",10.1007/s11042-018-6878-4,journalArticle,8EHKL4Y9,2019,,1
Hierarchical attention-based anomaly detection model for embedded operating systems,NO,,,,"Real-time embedded system applications have become pervasive, and with the increasing reliance on automated systems for both critical and non-critical tasks, the trend is set to continue. This growing reliance on real-time embedded systems, as well as the rise in the complexity of these systems, demands an efficient monitoring tool that takes the complex interactions in the system into consideration. These systems are well-specified, and there exists standard error or fault detection mechanism to detect when an anomaly occurs in the applications controlling the operation. Nonetheless, these anomaly detection mechanisms gather information about the behavior of the software against its intended goals through the use of plausibility checks which rely on a priori knowledge of the application behavior. This kind of test raises two issues: (1) there should be a complete characterization of the software to derive the redundant information needed for plausibility checks, (2) this test focuses mainly on detecting errors/faults/anomalies in a single application with no regard to other entities in the integrated system. On the other hand, an embedded real-time system (fitted with an operating system) usually has the operating system and the integrated application statically linked to produce a single executable image. This bespoke nature of the embedded real-time system design means that the kernel traces reflect the behavior of the application and the associated hardware components at every point in time. Consequently, detecting deviations in the kernel trace invariably imply system-wide anomaly detection in the associated application and hardware. Thus, this paper targets anomaly not just in the application layer, but also in other layers that make up the real-time embedded system. Therefore, we introduce a hierarchical attention-based anomaly detection (HAbAD) model based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks with Attention. It is a closed-world prediction-classification model which uses the reconstruction error from a non-parametric kernel density estimator to detect when an anomaly has occurred. We show the effectiveness of this approach using publicly available dataset, and the results confirm that this is a robust means of detecting anomalies in real-time embedded systems.  2018 IEEE.","Ezeme, Mellitus O.; Mahmoud, Qusay H.; Azim, Akramul",10.1109/RTCSA.2018.00035,conferencePaper,JIY4XWJ7,2018,,1
Individual tree-crown detection in rgb imagery using semi-supervised deep learning neural networks,NO,,,,"Remote sensing can transform the speed, scale, and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.  2019 by the authors.","Weinstein, Ben G.; Marconi, Sergio; Bohlman, Stephanie; Zare, Alina; White, Ethan",10.3390/rs11111309,journalArticle,DTEE65Z7,2019,,1
A Model for Real-Time Traffic Signs Recognition Based on the YOLO Algorithm  A Case Study Using Vietnamese Traffic Signs,NO,,,,"The rapid development of the automobile resulted in the traffic infrastructure becomes more and more complicated. Both type and the number of traffic signs on the streets are increasing. Therefore, there is a need for applications to support drivers to recognize the traffic signs on the streets to help them avoid missing traffic signs. This paper proposes an approach to detecting and classifying Vietnamese traffic signs based on the YOLO algorithm, a unified deep learning architecture for real-time recognition applications. An anchor boxes size calculation component based on the k-means clustering algorithm is added to identify the anchor boxes size for the YOLO algorithm. A Vietnamese traffic sign dataset including 5000 images containing 5704 traffic signs of types was collected and used for evaluation. The F1 score of the tiny model (the fastest but the most inaccurate model) achieved is about more than 92% and the detection time is approximately 0.17s (in our testing environment: laptop CPU Intel 3520M, 8GB RAM, no GPU).

Learn to focus on objects for visual detection,NO,,,,"State-of-art visual detectors utilize object proposals as the reference of objects to achieve higher efficiency. However, the number of the proposal to ensure full coverage of potential objects is still large because the proposals are generated with thread and thrum, exposing proposal computation as a bottleneck. This paper presents a complementary technique that aims to work with any existing proposal generating system, amending the work-flow from ""propose-assess"" to ""propose-adjust-assess"". Inspired by the biological processing, we propose to improve the quality of object proposals by analyzing visual contexts and gradually focusing proposals on targets. In particular, the proposed method can be employed with existing proposals generation algorithms based on both hand-crafted features and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. For the former, we realize the focusing function by two learning-based transformation models, which are trained for identifying generic objects using image cues. For the latter, a Focus Proposal Net (FoPN) with cascaded layers, which can be directly injected into CNN models in an end-to-end manner, is developed as the implementation of focusing operation. Experiments on real-life image data sets demonstrate that the quality of the proposal is improved by the proposed technique. Besides, it can reduce the number of proposals to achieve high recall rate of the objects based on both hand-crafted features and CNN-features, and can boost the performance of state-of-art detectors.  2018","Chen, Zijing; Li, Jun; You, Xinhua",10.1016/j.neucom.2018.06.082,journalArticle,39AGNVCT,2019,,1
Object-Aware Multimodal Named Entity Recognition in Social Media Posts with Adversarial Learning,NO,,,,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) in social media posts is challenging since texts are usually short and contexts are lacking. Most recent works show that visual information can boost the NER performance since images can provide complementary contextual information for texts. However, the image-level features ignore the mapping relations between fine-grained visual objects and textual entities, which results in error detection in entities with different types. To better exploit visual and textual information in NER, we propose an adversarial gated bilinear attention neural network (AGBAN). The model jointly extracts entity-related features from both visual objects and texts, and leverages an adversarial training to map two different representations into a shared representation. As a result, domain information contained in an image can be transferred and applied for extracting named entities in the text associated with the image. Experimental results on Tweets dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed gated bilinear attention network in capturing the interactions of mutimodal features visual objects and textual words. Our results indicate that the adversarial training can effectively exploit commonalities across heterogeneous data sources, which leads to improved performance in NER when compared to models purely exploiting text data or combining the image-level visual features.  1999-2012 IEEE.","Zheng, Changmeng; Wu, Zhiwei; Wang, Tao; Cai, Yi; Li, Qing",10.1109/TMM.2020.3013398,journalArticle,KPU6HE8T,2021,,1
Runway Detection and Localization in Aerial Images using Deep Learning,NO,,,,"Landing is the most difficult phase of the flight for any airborne platform. Due to lack of efficient systems, there have been numerous landing accidents resulting in the damage of onboard hardware. Vision based systems provides low cost solution to detect landing sites by providing rich textual information. To this end, this research focuses on accurate detection and localization of runways in aerial images with untidy terrains which would consequently help aerial platforms especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (commonly referred to as Drones) to detect landing targets (i.e., runways) to aid automatic landing. Most of the prior work regarding runway detection is based on simple image processing algorithms with lot of assumptions and constraints about precise position of runway in a particular image. First part of this research is to develop runway detection algorithm based on state-of-the-art deep learning architectures while the second part is runway localization using both deep learning and non-deep learning based methods. The proposed runway detection approach is two-stage modular where in the first stage the aerial image classification is achieved to find the existence of runway in that particular image. Later, in the second stage, the identified runways are localized using both conventional line detection algorithms and more recent deep learning models.

Overwrapping reduces this to 1.8 and 5.2cm, respectively, as more fringes are generated without altering signal to noise ratio. We test the approach on time series of cumulative deformation from Campi Flegrei and Dallol, where overwrapping improves classification performance by up to 15%.

At Campi Flegrei, deformation of 8.5cm/year was detected after 60days and at Dallol, deformation of 3.5cm/year was detected after 310days.

Exploring uncertainty measures in deep networks for multiple sclerosis lesion detection and segmentation,NO,,,,"Deep learning (DL) networks have recently been shown to outperform other segmentation methods on various public, medical-image challenge datasets [3, 11, 16], especially for large pathologies. However, in the context of diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), monitoring all the focal lesions visible on MRI sequences, even very small ones, is essential for disease staging, prognosis, and evaluating treatment efficacy. Moreover, producing deterministic outputs hinders DL adoption into clinical routines. Uncertainty estimates for the predictions would permit subsequent revision by clinicians. We present the first exploration of multiple uncertainty estimates based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout [4] in the context of deep networks for lesion detection and segmentation in medical images. Specifically, we develop a 3D MS lesion segmentation CNN, augmented to provide four different voxel-based uncertainty measures based on MC dropout. We train the network on a proprietary, large-scale, multi-site, multi-scanner, clinical MS dataset, and compute lesion-wise uncertainties by accumulating evidence from voxel-wise uncertainties within detected lesions.

SIPs: Succinct Interest Points from Unsupervised Inlierness Probability Learning,NO,,,,"A wide range of computer vision algorithms rely on identifying sparse interest points in images and establishing correspondences between them. However, only a subset of the initially identified interest points results in true correspondences (inliers). In this paper, we seek a detector that finds the minimum number of points that are likely to result in an application-dependent 'sufficient' number of inliers k. To quantify this goal, we introduce the 'k-succinctness' metric. Extracting a minimum number of interest points is attractive for many applications, because it can reduce computational load, memory, and data transmission. Alongside succinctness, we introduce an unsupervised training methodology for interest point detectors that is based on predicting the probability of a given pixel being an inlier. In comparison to previous learned detectors, our method requires the least amount of data pre-processing. Our detector and other state-of-the-art detectors are extensively evaluated with respect to succinctness on popular public datasets covering both indoor and outdoor scenes, and both wide and narrow baselines.

Text detection and recognition for natural scene images using deep convolutional neural networks,NO,,,,"Words are the most indispensable information in human life. It is very important to analyze and understand the meaning of words. Compared with the general visual elements, the text conveys rich and high-level moral information, which enables the computer to better understand the semantic content of the text. With the rapid development of computer technology, great achievements have been made in text information detection and recognition. However, when dealing with text characters in natural scene images, there are still some limitations in the detection and recognition of natural scene images. Because natural scene image has more interference and complexity than text, these factors make the detection and recognition of natural scene image text face many challenges. To solve this problem, a new text detection and recognition method based on depth convolution neural network is proposed for natural scene image in this paper. In text detection, this method obtains high-level visual features from the bottom pixels by ResNet network, and extracts the context features from character sequences by BLSTM layer, then introduce to the idea of faster R-CNN vertical anchor point to find the bounding box of the detected text, which effectively improves the effect of text object detection.

UOLO is trained on a set of bounding boxes enclosing the objects to detect, as well as pixel-wise segmentation information, when available. A new loss function is devised, taking into account whether a reference segmentation is accessible for each training image, in order to suitably backpropagate the error. We validate UOLO on the task of simultaneous optic disc (OD) detection, fovea detection, and OD segmentation from retinal images, achieving state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.

Wafer Manufacturing Data Anomaly Detection Based on Error Attention,NO,,,,"In wafer manufacturing processes, it was difficult and inefficient to extract abnormal data in the anomaly detection. Therefore, an anomaly detection method was proposed based on error attention mechanism. Firstly, the wafer manufacturing data was converted into grayscale images while keeping the data distribution unchanged. Then, based on the errors with the normal sample, a position-based flexible attention map was generated for the grayscale images. The dominant expressions of the error features were developed while the redundant features areomitted. In addition, deep learning neural network model LeNet-5 was used to perform convolution training to obtain an optimal model for anomaly detection. Finally, the wafer fabrication data set was used to compare the performance between the proposed method and the existing methods. The proposed method reduces the time consuming by 160% and increases the F2-Score by 3%, which verifies the effectiveness of the method.  2020, China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office.

Quantification and Analysis of Laryngeal Closure from Endoscopic Videos,NO,,,,"Objective: At present, there are no objective techniques to quantify and describe laryngeal obstruction, and the reproducibility of subjective manual quantification methods is insufficient, resulting in diagnostic inaccuracy and a poor signal-to-noise ratio in medical research. In this work, a workflow is proposed to quantify laryngeal movements from laryngoscopic videos, to facilitate the diagnosis procedure. Methods: The proposed method analyses laryngoscopic videos, and delineates glottic opening, vocal folds, and supraglottic structures, using a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based algorithm. The segmentation is divided into two steps: A bounding box which indicates the region of interest (RoI) is found, followed by segmentation using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The segmentation results are statistically quantified along the temporal dimension and processed using singular spectrum analysis (SSA), to extract clear objective information that can be used by the clinicians in diagnosis. Results: The segmentation was validated on 400 images from 20 videos acquired using different endoscopic systems from different patients. The results indicated significant improvements over using FCN only in terms of both processing speed (16 FPS vs. 8 FPS) and segmentation result statistics. Five clinical cases on patients have also been provided to showcase the quantitative analysis results using the proposed method. Conclusion: The proposed method guarantees a robust and fast processing of laryngoscopic videos. Measurements of glottic angles and supraglottic index showed distinctive patterns in the provided clinical cases. Significance: The proposed automated and objective method extracts important temporal laryngeal movement information, which can be used to aid laryngeal closure diagnosis.  1964-2012 IEEE.","Lin, Jianyu; Walsted, Emil S.; Backer, Vibeke; Hull, James H.; Elson, Daniel S.",10.1109/TBME.2018.2867636,journalArticle,KHWLQEEQ,2019,,1
Detection model for tea buds based on region brightness adaptive correction,NO,,,,"An Accurate and rapid detection of tea buds can be a critical precondition in an intelligent tea-picking system. Nevertheless, it is still lacking in the robustness, universality, and accuracy during the segmentation of tea buds images under natural light. Fortunately, deep learning can greatly contribute to the artificial extraction of features for higher accuracy of tea bud detection in recent years. However, the current detection of tea bud can also be affected by the light to a great extent. Thus, it is very necessary to establish a new model of tea bud detection with high robustness and low sensitivity for intelligent tea picking in a natural environment. A novel automatic detection model of tea buds was proposed using a regional brightness adaptive correction and deep learning, in order to improve the robustness under different light intensities. First, the Longjing 43 tea was taken as a research object to collect the images under various light intensities. A labelling software was then used to label for the ""V"" and ""I"" posture of one bud and one leaf. After that, a data enhancement was performed by adding the Gaussian noise and horizontal mirroring. Second, the RGB images were converted to the grayscale images, of which the gray values were averaged. Subsequently, the distribution of the Average Gray (AG) values and convolution feature diagram were utilized to classify the grayscale images under different illumination intensities. Specifically, three levels were obtained, including the low, medium, and high brightness, corresponding to the intervals [30, 90), [90, 170), and [170, 230], respectively. A gamma brightness adaptive correction was then performed on the images with high brightness using different sizes of partitioning. At last, the multiple models of tea buds detection using deep learning were trained on the same training and test set. The results showed that the YOLOv5+CSPDarknet53 presented an optimal performance of tea bud detection, with the detection precision of 88.2% and recall rate of 82.1%, compared with SSD+VGG16, Faster RCNN+VGG16, YOLOv3+Darknet53, and YOLOv4+CSPDarknet53 models. The precision of detection was improved by 4.8 percentage points after a detection suppression on the YOLOv5 model. Thus, there was much less phenomenon that the same target was boxed for several times. Moreover, the image features of tea buds were of high significance in the brightness intervals [30, 90) and [90, 170), indicating that there was a much fewer influence of the brightness adaptive correction on the detection of the images with the medium or low brightness. There was also a relatively lower contrast between the tea buds and old leaves in the high brightness images. Furthermore, the significance of tea buds was weakened with the deepening of network layers, indicating that the effective features of tea buds cannot be extracted so far. As such, the recall rate of bud detection was only 71.1% for the high brightness images, indicating a relatively high missing detection rate. More importantly, the recall rate of bud detection was promoted by 19.2 percentage points than before, particularly after 23 block and regional gamma adaptive brightness correction for the high brightness images. The testing of tea images under various light intensities demonstrated that the YOLOv5 detection model using a regional brightness adaptive correction achieved the detection precision of 92.4% and the recall rate of 90.4%, indicating high robustness and low sensitivity to light changes. Therefore, the finding can provide a promising theoretical basis for the intelligent tea-picking system under natural light conditions.  2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

DSL: Automatic liver segmentation with faster R-CNN and deeplab,NO,,,,"Liver segmentation is a crucial step in computer-assisted diagnosis and surgical planning of liver diseases. However, it is still a quite challenging task due to four reasons. First, the grayscale of the liver and its adjacent organ tissues is similar. Second, partial volume effect makes the liver contour blurred. Third, most clinical images have serious pathology such as liver tumor. Forth, each persons liver shape is discrepant. In this paper, we proposed DSL (detection and segmentation laboratory) method based on Faster R-CNN (faster regions with CNN features) and DeepLab. The DSL consists of two steps: to reduce the scope of subsequent liver segmentation, Faster R-CNN is employed to detect liver area. Next, the detection results are input to DeepLab for segmentation.

An analogy between various machine-learning techniques for detecting construction materials in digital images,NO,,,,"Digital images and video clips collected at construction jobsites are commonly used for extracting useful information. Exploring new applications for image processing techniques within the area of construction engineering and management is a steady growing field of research. One of the initial steps for various image processing applications is automatically detecting various types of construction materials on construction images. In this paper, the authors conducted a comparison study to evaluate the performance of different machine learning techniques for detection of three common categorists of building materials: Concrete, red brick, and OSB boards. The employed classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for building material detection. The results indicate that for all three types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate.  2016, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Rashidi, Abbas; Sigari, Mohamad Hoseyn; Maghiar, Marcel; Citrin, David",10.1007/s12205-015-0726-0,journalArticle,3KVRDSD3,2016,,1

Real time expert system for anomaly detection of aerators based on computer vision technology and existing surveillance cameras,NO,,,,"Aerators are essential and crucial auxiliary devices in intensive culture, especially in industrial culture in China. However, due to overload operation and poor working condition, the aerator will often has abnormal condition but cannot be detected in time, which will lead to rapid death of fish in large areas due to lack of oxygen, and then cause huge economic losses and ecological problems. The traditional methods cannot accurately detect abnormal condition of aerators in time. The manual inspection method is laborious and inefficient, and circuit detection methods often suffer from error detection or short circuit. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a real-time expert system for anomaly detection of aerators. Surveillance cameras are widely used as visual perception modules of the Internet of Things, but they are only used to detect suspicious behavior of human being in aquaculture in China. Using these widely existing surveillance cameras to realize real-time anomaly detection of aerators is a cost-free and easy-to-promote method, which also provides a useful reference and attempt for intelligent agriculture and agricultural expert systems. However, it is difficult to develop such an expert system due to some technical and applied challenges, e.g., illumination, occlusion, complex background, etc. To tackle these aforementioned challenges, we propose a real-time expert system based on computer vision technology and existing surveillance cameras for anomaly detection of aerators, which consists of two modules, i.e., object region detection and working state detection. First, it is difficult to detect the working state for some small object regions in whole images, and the time complexity of global feature comparison is also high, so we present an object region detection method based on the region proposal idea. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm called reference frame Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (RF-KLT) algorithm for motion feature extraction in fixed regions. Then, we present a dimension reduction method of time series for establishing a feature dataset with obvious boundaries between classes. Finally, we use machine learning algorithms to build the feature classifier. The experimental results show that the accuracy for detecting object region and working state of aerators is 100% and 99.9% respectively, and the detection speed is 77-333 frames per second (FPS) according to the different types of surveillance cameras. The proposed expert system can realize real-time, robust and cost-free anomaly detection of aerators in both the actual video dataset and the augmented video dataset. Copyright  2018, The Authors.

Detecting and tracing assembly in intelligent workshop: A application based on convolutional neural network,NO,,,,"In traditional manufacturing assemblies, the assembly process and results are in a weakly supervised state. In order to ensure the assembly quality of the assembly and reduce the problems caused by the possibility of missing and misplaced due to manual errors in the manufacturing assembly. Therefore, a method based on convolutional neural network visual recognition for assembly quality of detection and trace is proposed. The images of the assembly units are collected by the industrial cameras. The pre-classification by AlexNet during testing can effectively avoid cross and error detection between assembly units with high similarity. Then, the Faster R-CNN convolutional neural network is used for transfer learning, the trained weight files can be used to perform multi-target detection on the equipment components, and the trained model enables accurate and efficient error detection in assembly.

A machine learning approach to map tropical selective logging,NO,,,,"Hundreds of millions of hectares of tropical forest have been selectively logged, either legally or illegally. Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (>20 m3 ha1). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (3 ha1). We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Para northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.  2018 The Authors","Hethcoat, M.G.; Edwards, D.P.; Carreiras, J.M.B.; Bryant, R.G.; Franca, F.M.; Quegan, S.",10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.044,journalArticle,RL3HIXQD,2019,,1
W-Transformer: Accurate Cobb angles estimation by using a transformer-based hybrid structure,NO,,,,"Background: Scoliosis is a type of spinal deformity, which is harmful to a person's health. In severe cases, it can trigger paralysis or death. The measurement of Cobb angle plays an essential role in assessing the severity ofscoliosis. Purpose: The aim of this paper is to propose an automatic system for landmark detection and Cobb angle estimation, which can effectively help clinicians diagnose and treatscoliosis. Methods: A novel hybrid framework was proposed to measure Cobb angle precisely for clinical diagnosis, which was referred as W-Transformer due to its w-shaped architecture. First, a convolutional neural network of cascade residual blocks as our backbone was designed. Then a transformer was fused to learn the dependency information between spine and landmarks. In addition, a reinforcement branch was designed to improve the overlap of landmarks, and an improved prediction module was proposed to fine-tune the final coordinates of landmarks in Cobb angles estimation. Besides, the public Accurate Automated Spinal Curvature Estimation (AASCE) MICCAI 2019 challenge was served as data set. It supplies 609 manually labeled spine anteriorposterior (AP) X-ray images, each of which contains a total of 68 landmark labels and three Cobb Anglestags. Results: From the perspective of the AASCE MICCAI 2019 challenge, we achieved a lower symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 8.26% for all Cobb angles and the lowest averaged detection error of 50.89 in terms of landmark detection, compared with many state-of-the-art methods. We also provided the SMAPEs for the Cobb angles of the proximal-thoracic (PT), the main-thoracic (MT), and the thoracic-lumbar (TL) area, which are 5.27%, 14.59%, and 20.97% respectively, however, these data were not covered in most previous studies. Statistical analysis demonstrates that our model has obtained a high level of Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9398 ((Formula presented.)), which shows excellent reliability of our model. Our model can yield 0.9489 ((Formula presented.)), 0.8817 ((Formula presented.)), and 0.9149 ((Formula presented.)) for PT, MT, and TL, respectively. The overall variability of Cobb angle measurement is less than 4 (Formula presented.), implying clinical value. And the mean absolute deviation (standard deviation) for three regions is 3.64 (Formula presented.) (4.13 (Formula presented.)), 3.84 (Formula presented.) (4.66 (Formula presented.)), and 3.80 (Formula presented.) (4.19 (Formula presented.)). The results of Student paired (Formula presented.) -test indicate that no statistically significant differences are observed between manual measurement and our automatic approach ((Formula presented.) -value is always (Formula presented.) 0.05). Regarding the diagnosis of scoliosis (Cobb angle (Formula presented.) 10 (Formula presented.)), the proposed method achieves a high sensitivity of 0.9577 and a specificity of 0.8475 for all spinalregions.

In medical domain texts, due to their terminological complexity and linguistic particularities, the usual spell-checkers are ineffective and automatic processing is a challenge on many occasions. Therefore, this project arises with the intention of providing a module based on linguistic knowledge that can add another layer of information to current techniques and, consequently, contribute to the improvement of corpus belonging to the field of medicine. In order to investigate the mentioned objective, a study corpus is designed consisting of a compilation of electronic clinical reports, error extraction tools and statistical analysis are used to design a typology of error, and natural language processing techniques and machine learning methods are applied for the implementation of the proposal.  2020 CEUR-WS.

Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training - Speech synthesis is almost all you need,NO,,,,"The research community has long studied computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) methods in non-native speech. Researchers focused on studying various model architectures, such as Bayesian networks and deep learning methods, as well as on the analysis of different representations of the speech signal. Despite significant progress in recent years, existing CAPT methods are not able to detect pronunciation errors with high accuracy (only 60% precision at 40%-80% recall). One of the key problems is the low availability of mispronounced speech that is needed for the reliable training of pronunciation error detection models. If we had a generative model that could mimic non-native speech and produce any amount of training data, then the task of detecting pronunciation errors would be much easier. We present three innovative techniques based on phoneme-to-phoneme (P2P), text-to-speech (T2S), and speech-to-speech (S2S) conversion to generate correctly pronounced and mispronounced synthetic speech. We show that these techniques not only improve the accuracy of three machine learning models for detecting pronunciation errors but also help establish a new state-of-the-art in the field. Earlier studies have used simple speech generation techniques such as P2P conversion, but only as an additional mechanism to improve the accuracy of pronunciation error detection. We, on the other hand, consider speech generation to be the first-class method of detecting pronunciation errors. The effectiveness of these techniques is assessed in the tasks of detecting pronunciation and lexical stress errors. Non-native English speech corpora of German, Italian, and Polish speakers are used in the evaluations. The best proposed S2S technique improves the accuracy of detecting pronunciation errors in AUC metric by 41% from 0.528 to 0.749 compared to the state-of-the-art approach.  2022, CC BY.","Korzekwa, Daniel; Lorenzo-Trueba, Jaime; Drugman, Thomas; Kostek, Bozena",10.48550/arXiv.2207.00774,journalArticle,7JNSATEY,2022,,1
Insulator State Detection of Convolutional Neural Networks Based on Feedback Mechanism,NO,,,,"As an important equipment on the transmission line, the conditions of insulators directly affect the safe operation of power grid. Therefore, it is important and necessary to detect the insulator state automatically and accurately. However, existing detection models with constant feature space have drawbacks for distinctive samples, and it is complex to extract insulator image features. Thus, a method for insulator state detection based on convolutional neural network and feedback mechanism is explored in this paper, which imitates the human cognition process with repetitive comparison and inference from simple to fine. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the insulator samples, the network structure of LeNet-5 is improved by employing stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) and the feedback mechanism, and the alternate optimization strategy is adopted to optimize the parameters of the convolution neural network. Secondly, based on the entropy theory, the semantic error entropy measurement index is established to evaluate the uncertainty of the insulator detection results in real time to overcome the posterior evaluation. Finally, according to the evaluation results of semantic error information entropy measurement index, the feedback mechanism is constructed to adjust the size and number of the convolution kernels to extract the refined features for the repeated comparison and inference. The experimental results show that the improved convolution neural network model has a superior accuracy in insulator state detection.  2019, Electrical Technology Press Co. Ltd.

Semi-Supervised and Multi-Task Learning for On-Street Parking Space Status Inference,NO,,,,"To manage on-street parking spaces, magnetic sensor is often used due to its low cost and flexibility in installation and usage. However, its signals are easily affected by environment, vehicle type, installation location and moving neighboring vehicles. Besides, accidental installation also leads to non-unified coordinate of magnetic sensors which makes the management system difficult to recognize. To overcome these challenges, we proposed a novel semi-supervised and multi-task learning framework for sensor based on-street parking slot inference with three contributions. First, a Coordinate Transform Module is integrated into our framework to reduce the diversity of input signals by transforming them adaptively into a unified coordinate. Second, to learn the generalized and discriminative features while minimizing the amount of labeled data, we introduce a Multi-task Module to leverage the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Third, we embed a Temporal Module, which observes and memorizes the parking states from time to time, to infer parking space status in a reliable way. The experimental results show that, with the proposed three modules, our end-to-end training framework could reduce the error detection and hence improve the system accuracy.",You-Feng Wu; Vu-Hoang Tran; Ching-Chun Huang,10.1109/MAPR.2019.8743537,conferencePaper,ALDKK7EK,2019,,1
Improving Right Whale recognition by fine-tuning alignment and using wide localization network,NO,,,,"Right Whales can be recognized by the callosities pattern on their heads. They are an endangered species with an estimated 450 whales remaining. Marine biologists regularly perform manual recognition of the whales while monitoring the population but the process is slow and time consuming. Deep learning methods achieved state-of-the-art results on several visual recognition tasks. However, training deep learning models on this task is very difficult because the number of training images is low. We propose a wide localization network which can be used to localize the region of interest in image. Once the region of interest is localized, a deep learning model can be used to classify the whales.

Detection method of green potato based on hyperspectral imaging,NO,,,,"To solve the problems of difficulties in detecting the slightly green potatoes placed randomly, two detection methods were compared based on the semi-transmission and reflection hyperspectral imaging technologies and then a more optimal detection method was determined. 225 potatoes samples were selected, including 122 normal samples and 103 green samples. Semi-transmission and reflection hyperspectral imaging technologies were used to extract the RGB, HSV and Lab color information from the image; the isometric mapping (Isomap), the maximum variance unfolding (MVU) and the Laplacian feature mapping (LE) were utilized to reduce the dimension of image information. Semi-transmission and reflection hyperspectral imaging technologies were used to extract the average spectrum from the spectral region of interest; the linearity preserving projection (LPP), the local tangent space alignment (LTSA) and the locally linear coordination (LLC) were utilized to reduce the dimension of spectral information. The deep belief networks (DBN) model which is a kind of deep learning approach was developed based on the image and spectrums of different hyperspectral imaging ways. The multi-source information fusion technology was used to optimize the model with a high detection accuracy and different detection models were built based on different ways of imaging or the fusion of image and spectrum. The results show that the fusion model, which is developed based on the semi-transmission hyperspectral imaging and the reflection hyperspectral imaging, is the best option. Its detection rate can reach 100% in both the calibration and the validation. Non-distractive detecting of the slightly green potatoes can be realized with this fusion model.  2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Chinese spelling error detection using a fusion lattice LSTM,NO,,,,"Spelling error detection serves as a crucial preprocessing in many natural language processing applications. Due to the characteristics of Chinese Language, Chinese spelling error detection is more challenging than error detection in English. Existing methods are mainly under a pipeline framework, which artificially divides error detection process into steps. Thus, these methods bring error propagation and cannot always work well due to the complexity of the language environment. Besides existing methods only adopt character or word information, and ignore the positive effect of fusing character, word and pinyin1 information together. We propose an FL-LSTM-CRF model, which is an extension of the LSTM-CRF with word lattices and character-pinyin-fusion inputs. Our model takes advantage of the end-to-end framework to detect errors as a whole process, and dynamically integrates character, word and pinyin information. Experiments on the SIGHAN data show that our FL-LSTM-CRF outperforms existing methods with similar external resources consistently, and confirm the feasibility of adopting the end-to-end framework and the availability of integrating of character, word and pinyin information.

Remote sensing identification method of flood-inundated area based on perceptual visual attention,NO,,,,"Emergency flood relief needs fast and precise spatial information of flood-inundated area. Because of spectral similarity to some extent, inundated area was often viewed as water body and then derived from remote sensing classification result of the water areas before flood disaster minus that after flood disaster, which often caused difficulties in separating inundated area from true water body (e.g. river, lake or reservoir) and waterlogged cropland. This paper proposed an optimized method for identifying inundated area based on human perceptual visual attention and spatio-temporal variation characteristics of flood. Flood-inundated area is a temporary compound of water and other flooded objects (e.g., crops). It has specific spatio-temporal dynamic property, which differs from that of water body and could be used as a stable basis for remote sense identification of the inundated area. After the specific property was digitalized into numerical and visual data by generating a composite RGB color imagery of NDVI, MNDWI before the flood event and NDWI after the inundation, apparent coloring difference between water body and the inundated area in the imagery was reached. To gain reliable machine-vision detection based results of the flood-inundated area, an imagery of Munsell HLC color was transformed from the RGB imagery and then adopted in unsupervised classification based on coefficient of NBS color distance and K-means clustering algorithm. A case was studied on applying the proposed method to derive information of the inundated area in 2016 flood disaster in middle reaches of Yangtze River Basin and using Landsat OLI images. And an error confusion matrix method was adopted in the accuracy assessment on recognition results of the inundated area. The results showed that the proposed method gained excellent detection of the area with coefficients of Kappa and composite classification accuracy (CCA) equal to 93.4% and 88.5%, respectively. A controlled experiment on the credibility of different remote sensing classification methods for the same identification object (i.e. flooded-inundated area) was also made. It proved the proposed method for detection of flood-inundated area based on the selective visual attention mechanism could effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing identification on the area with its CCA coefficient of 5% larger than that of the traditional method. The proposed method also had good performance on easily separating the flooded-inundated areas from water and waterlogged cropland, especially helped solving the misclassification between the flooded-inundated area and the water body. These benefited from three keys: 1) The inundated area was viewed as that not equal to water coverage in remote sensing classification, which could be proven by the former's higher heterogeneity and its different spatio-temporal dynamic property. As a result, the identification uncertainty of the area was reduced. 2) Digital visualization of spatio-temporal variation features of the inundated area was completed through data fusion of NDWI after the inundation and NDVI and MNDWI before the flood event, which enhanced the area's visual saliency on the remote sensing image and made it possible to identify them using machine-vision color clustering. 3) Difference of the flooded-inundated areas from the water and waterlogged cropland was precisely captured in the NBS image in HLC space that was transformed from the fusion image at an optimized RGB color matching scheme (i.e. red given to NDWI after the inundation, green and blue to NDVI and MNDWI before the inundation, respectively). During summer flooding of the study area in 2016, the waterlogged farmland with crops uncovered by water was about 19 143.35 hm2 while the inundated acreage was up to 142 157.5 hm2, among which 16.6% (i.e. 23 579 hm2) was being planted with rice paddy. Additionally, most of the inundated areas located in low-lying land along mainstream of the middle Yangtze River and its two branches, namely Hanjiang River and Fuhe River. The most severe flood disaster occurred in Wuhan City with 34 492 hm2 of the inundated acreage.  2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Deep learning and statistical models for detection of white stem borer disease in Arabica coffee,NO,,,,"Early detection of crop pest and disease is very critical for taking up suitable control measures to reduce the loss of economic yield. Coffee is an important commercial crop in India which is affected by pests and diseases every year resulting in major yield loss. White stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) is the most serious pest of coffee (Arabica sp.) in India causing substantial loss of yield every year. Detection of the infestation in its early stage is quite challenging. In this regard, image pattern recognition techniques offer cost effective and scalable solutions. An image library was created representing different stages of the plant infestation using camera/mobile devices. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models use these images of healthy and infested plants for early detection of white stem borer infestation. The overall methodology included image processing, machine learning, supervised transfer learning and unsupervised auto-encoding techniques to solve the problem of early detection and severity of the infestation. Using the Inception v3 transfer learning model, we obtained average accuracy of 85.5% which is quite encouraging with limited image datasets. We explore Unsupervised Autoencoder models, which can work with limited image datasets. In addition, statistical analysis of long-term climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and luminescence is explored for reliable detection and diagnosis of the infestation. Based on the encouraging results, a mobile application is proposed for near real time monitoring of WSB infestation to help the coffee planter's community.  Authors 2019.

An aircraft target detection method based on regional convolutional neural network for remote sensing images,NO,,,,"The aircraft target is the key object of battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance. It can accurately and efficiently detect the aircraft target from the remote sensing images which aim at ground reconnaissance. First of all, it can quickly acquire the intelligence of the enemy's military activities and provide support for the identification of the air target. Second, it can evaluate the importance of the military airport and analyze enemy's operational intentions, to achieve a precise strike against the enemy's aircraft targets. The existing aircraft detection method uses a single convolutional neural network to accomplish the whole process of feature extraction and recognition. It fails to effectively extract the characteristics of aircraft targets and ignore the scale differences of different aircraft. Thus, the recognition results are not accurate enough. Aiming at this problem, this paper uses the deep residual network to extract the characteristics of aircraft targets, studies and analyzes the size of different aircraft targets, and uses K-means to cluster different sizes. The cluster centers are representative aircraft sizes. Based on these representative sizes of the aircrafts, the Aircraft Targets Region Proposal Network (ATRPN) is proposed to synthesize the geometric characteristics of different aircraft. Based on the faster regional convolutional neural network detection framework (Faster R-CNN), taking the deep residual network and ARPPN as the front end and the candidate box generation network, the ATRPN R-CNN remote sensing image aircraft target detection method is proposed. This paper also establishes an aircraft target detection data set with uniform distribution, complete shape and rich aerial photography angle. After training the ATRPN R-CNN remote sensing image aircraft target detection method on the data set, the performance comparison experiment was carried out with the detection framework of Faster R-CNN and single network target multi-scale detection framework (SSD). The experimental results show that the detection method has higher detection accuracy in many different scenes including different aircraft targets.  2019 IEEE.","Wang, Bing; Zhou, Yan; Zhang, Huainian; Wang, Ning",10.1109/ICEIEC.2019.8784637,conferencePaper,KJVPJ68M,2019,,1

A convolution neural network algorithm is used for image data classification, and the classified image is transformed into image data to learn the topological structure of the image. To improve the accuracy of the image classification and reduce the loss rate, a parameter for finding a fast-optimal point of image classification is set by a convolutional neural network and a pixel image as a preprocessor.

On-line detection and segmentation of sports motions using a wearable sensor,NO,,,,"In sports motion analysis, observation is a prerequisite for understanding the quality of motions. This paper introduces a novel approach to detect and segment sports motions using a wearable sensor for supporting systematic observation.

For explicit segmentation, a motion model is defined as a sequence of sub-motions with boundary states.

The evaluation on two types of motions (soccer kicking and two-handed ball throwing) verifies that the proposed method is successful for the accurate detection and segmentation of sports motions. By developing a sports motion analysis system using the motion model and the sequence classifier, we show that the proposed method is useful for observation of sports motions by automatically providing relevant motion data for analysis.  2018 by the authors.

Deep transfer learning of virtual endoluminal views for the detection of polyps in CT colonography,NO,,,,"Proper training of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) requires large annotated image databases that are currently not available in CT colonography (CTC). In this study, we employed a deep transfer learning (DETALE) scheme to circumvent this problem in automated polyp detection for CTC. In our method, a DCNN that had been pre-trained with millions of non-medical images was adapted to identify polyps using virtual endoluminal images of the polyp candidates prompted by a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. For evaluation, 154 CTC cases with and without fecal tagging were divided randomly into a development set and an external validation set including 107 polyps 6 mm in size. A CADe system was trained to detect polyp candidates using the development set, and the virtual endoluminal images of the polyp candidates were labeled manually into true-positive and several false-positive (FP) categories for transfer learning of the DCNN. Next, the trained CADe system was used to detect polyp candidates from the external validation set, and the DCNN reviewed their images to determine the final detections. The detection sensitivity of the standalone CADe system was 93% at 6.4 FPs per patient on average, whereas the DCNN reduced the number of FPs to 2.0 per patient without reducing detection sensitivity. Most of the remaining FP detections were caused by untagged stool. In fecal-tagged CTC cases, the detection sensitivity was 94% at only 0.78 FPs per patient on average. These preliminary results indicate that DETALE can yield substantial improvement in the accuracy of automated polyp detection in CTC.  2016 SPIE.","Nappi, Janne J.; Hironaka, Toru; Regge, Daniele; Yoshida, Hiroyuki",10.1117/12.2217260,conferencePaper,G7W4KWBZ,2016,,1

Detection of cold injury in peaches by hyperspectral reflectance imaging and artificial neural network,NO,,,,"Peaches in cold storage may develop chill damage, as symptomized by deteriorated texture and lack of juice. To examine fruit quality, we established a hyperspectral imaging system to detect cold injury, and an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed for which eight optimal wavelengths were selected.

Evidencing this relationship, the correlation coefficients between quality parameters and the respective spectral response of eight selected wavelengths were -0.587 to -0.700, 0.393 to 0.552, 0.510 to 0.751, and 0.574 to 0.773. With optimal representative wavelengths as inputs for the ANN model, the overall classification accuracy of chill damage was 95.8% for all cold-stored samples.

This is not what I imagined: Error Detection for Semantic Segmentation through Visual Dissimilarity [arXiv],NO,,,,"There has been a remarkable progress in the accuracy of semantic segmentation due to the capabilities of deep learning. Unfortunately, these methods are not able to generalize much further than the distribution of their training data and fail to handle out-of-distribution classes appropriately. This limits the applicability to autonomous or safety critical systems. We propose a novel method leveraging generative models to detect wrongly segmented or out-of-distribution instances.

Learning deep representations and detection of docking stations using underwater imaging,NO,,,,"Underwater docking endows AUVs with the ability of recharging and data transfer. Detection of underwater docking stations is a crucial step required to perform a successful docking. We propose a method to detect underwater docking stations using two dimensional images captured under different environmental light variance, deformations aroused by scale and rotation, different light intensity and partial observation. In order to realize our proposed method, we first train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn feature representations and then employ a deep detection network. In order to analyze the performance of the proposed method, we prepared an image dataset of docking stations using underwater imaging. Then, we explore the performance of our method using different data augmentation methods. We improved the AUC of detection by 0.14 using data augmentation and obtained 0.88 AUC with data augmentation. An increment of 0.23 AUC is gained by transfer learning and we obtained 0.88 AUC on another datasets.  2018 IEEE","Liu, Shuang; Ozay, Mete; Okatani, Takayuki; Xu, Hongli; Lin, Yang; Gu, Haitao",10.1109/OCEANSKOBE.2018.8559067,conferencePaper,QK243SDJ,2018,,1
Quantifying the uncertainty of event detection in full motion video,NO,,,,"Algorithms for the detection and tracking of (moving) objects can be combined into a system that automatically extracts relevant events from a large amount of video data. Such a system (data pipeline), can be particularly useful in video surveillance applications, notably to support analysts in retrieving information from hours of video while working under strict time constraints. Such data pipelines entail all sort of uncertainties, however, which can lead to erroneous detections being presented to the analyst. In this paper we present a novel method to attribute a confidence of correct detection to the output of a computer vision data pipeline. The method relies on a datadriven approach. A machine learning-based classifier is built to separate correct from erroneous detections. It is trained on features extracted from the pipeline; The features relate to both raw data properties, such as image quality, and to video content properties, such as detection characteristics. The validation of the results is done using two full motion video datasets from airborne platforms; the first being of the same type (same context) as the training set, the second being of a different type (new context). We conclude that the result of this classifier could be used to build a confidence of correct detection, separating the True Positives from the False Positives. This confidence can furthermore be used to prioritize the detections in order of reliability. This study concludes by identifying additional work measures needed to improve the robustness of the method.  2018 SPIE.","Neumann, Niels M.

Cryo-Balloon Catheter Localization Based on a Support-Vector-Machine Approach,NO,,,,"Cryo-balloon catheters have attracted an increasing amount of interest in the medical community as they can reduce patient risk during left atrial pulmonary vein ablation procedures. As cryo-balloon catheters are not equipped with electrodes, they cannot be localized automatically by electro-anatomical mapping systems. As a consequence, X-ray fluoroscopy has remained an important means for guidance during the procedure. Most recently, image guidance methods for fluoroscopy-based procedures have been proposed, but they provide only limited support for cryo-balloon catheters and require significant user interaction. To improve this situation, we propose a novel method for automatic cryo-balloon catheter detection in fluoroscopic images by detecting the cryo-balloon catheter's built-in X-ray marker. Our approach is based on a blob detection algorithm to find possible X-ray marker candidates. Several of these candidates are then excluded using prior knowledge. For the remaining candidates, several catheter specific features are introduced. They are processed using a machine learning approach to arrive at the final X-ray marker position. Our method was evaluated on 75 biplane fluoroscopy images from 40 patients, from two sites, acquired with a biplane angiography system. The method yielded a success rate of 99.0% in plane A and 90.6% in plane B, respectively. The detection achieved an accuracy of 1.00mm  0.82mm in plane A and 1.13mm  0.24mm in plane B. The localization in 3-D was associated with an average error of 0.36mm  0.86mm.  1982-2012 IEEE.","Kurzendorfer, Tanja; Mewes, Philip W.; Maier, Andreas; Strobel, Norbert; Brost, Alexander",10.1109/TMI.2016.2537052,journalArticle,9X3DRUUY,2016,,1
Design IoT-Based Blind Stick for Visually Disabled Persons,NO,,,,"Within the current time, the bulk of open places like general stores, open gardens, shopping centers, college campuses, etc. are beneath video surveillance.

The application of computer vision to detect malware,NO,,,,"This study examines the direct file binary and hexadecimal structure of raw files to assess if a file is malicious or benign. Current techniques fall into 3 main categories (reference). These categories are reputation based, structural analysis, and sandbox analysis. The methods applied to these techniques range from human static analysis, machine learning and automated indicator analysis. These techniques and methods have varying generalizability, but when considering the rate of new unique malware (av-test figure1), require large resources to keep pace. This studys method is quantitative. By converting raw byte strings into symmetric matrixes, a process that has similarities to image manipulation during classification, the framework for a classification problem is created (Soo Han, Kang and Im, 2011). This study attempts to convert this problem into an image classification problem outright to reveal underlying structures in the binary patterns themselves. The analysis of raw file binaries is an important development (reference). This capability will allow security appliances to make complex file assessments at near line speed on networks or minimal process cost on endpoints. Today this can only be done with static signatures, such as hashes (reference). This generalized detection mechanism has the potential to be system agnostic. The ability to do a raw bit-pattern analysis creates a generalized model of detection, which can identify patterns in files regardless of any apriori knowledge of threats.  2018 Curran Associates Inc.

Locating Wood Pith in a Wood Stem Cross Sectional Image Using YOLO Object Detection,NO,,,,"Sawmills rely on locating wood pith at the end surface of a wood stem either to automate the process and maximize the yield or to perform wood quality assessment of wood planks. Previously, wood pith location was approximated by applying image processing algorithms along with some geometric relations between the annual rings within a cross-sectional image of wood and its pith. This produces failed detection results if the wood stems deviate from a circular shape. In this paper, we propose employing YOLO (you only look once) object detection to a wood pith identification problem. The Tiny-YOLO network with 23 layers was trained using a transfer learning approach with 345 wood cross-sectional images with pith annotations. Different experiments with variable ratios between the training and testing datasets and training iterations were carried out to produce checkpoints and test against the testing datasets. We found that the minimum loss function which is commonly used to indicate the best trained model in other deep neural networks (DNNs) object detection is not effective for this application. Therefore, we used detection accuracy, to reflect the percentage of detectable piths while inferencing the trained model with its testing dataset and an average distance error, i.e., the average distances between the detected piths and their ground truths, as the accuracy measurement. The experimental result shows that a ratio of training and testing datasets of 70:30, at training iterations of 170,000, gives rise to the maximum detection value of 76.3% with a 16.6-pixel average distance error. Additionally, it produces only 25% average distance error; \frac{1034}{4176} with 50% standard deviation; \frac{2533}{5395}, compared to the state of the art non-DNN-based pith detection approach.  2019 IEEE.","Kurdthongmee, Wattanapong; Suwannarat, Korrakot",10.1109/TAAI48200.2019.8959823,conferencePaper,IYBYPZ7B,2019,,1
A systematic evaluation and optimization of automatic detection of ulcers in wireless capsule endoscopy on a large dataset using deep convolutional neural networks,NO,,,,"Compared with conventional gastroscopy which is invasive and painful, wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) can provide noninvasive examination of gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The WCE video can effectively support physicians to reach a diagnostic decision while a huge number of images need to be analyzed (more than 50 000 frames per patient). In this paper, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis method called second glance (secG) detection framework for automatic detection of ulcers based on deep convolutional neural networks that provides both classification confidence and bounding box of lesion area. We evaluated its performance on a large dataset that consists of 1504 patient cases (the largest WCE ulcer dataset to our best knowledge, 1076 cases with ulcers, 428 normal cases). We use 15 781 ulcer frames from 753 ulcer cases and 17 138 normal frames from 300 normal cases for training. Validation dataset consists of 2040 ulcer frames from 108 cases and 2319 frames from 43 normal cases. For test, we use 4917 ulcer frames from 215 ulcer cases and 5007 frames from 85 normal cases. Test results demonstrate the 0.9469 ROC-AUC of the proposed secG detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection frameworks including Faster-RCNN (0.9014) and SSD-300 (0.8355), which implies the effectiveness of our method. From the ulcer size analysis, we find the detection of ulcers is highly related to the size. For ulcers with size larger than 1% of the full image size, the sensitivity exceeds 92.00%. For ulcers that are smaller than 1% of the full image size, the sensitivity is around 85.00%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 89.71%, 90.48% and 90.10%, at a threshold value of 0.6706, which implies the potential of the proposed method to suppress oversights and to reduce the burden of physicians.  2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Wang, Sen; Xing, Yuxiang; Zhang, Li; Gao, Hewei; Zhang, Hao",10.1088/1361-6560/ab5086,journalArticle,8WKFTUEB,2019,,1

Landmine Detection Using Multispectral Images,NO,,,,"The conditions in which images are obtained to perform multispectral detection of landmines have a direct influence on the methods that are used to perform automatic detection of landmines. In this paper, two methodologies are proposed: one using traditional classifiers and the other using deep learning, namely, a convolutional neuronal network (CNN). In the first methodology, classifier fusion techniques are also used. The performance of the first methodology was evaluated as a function of the number of landmine features, the environment, and the depth of the mine. In deep learning, a study was carried out based on the feature map, the type of landmine, and the environment. A quantitative analysis shows that traditional classifiers achieved an overall accuracy of above 97% in indoor and outdoor environments for the detection of landmines. The adopted deep learning methodology presented an increase in the performance for larger mines and a decrease for smaller ones.

A real time vision system for traffic surveillance at intersections,NO,,,,"Traffic data collected at intersections are essential information for traffic signal operations, traffic control, and intersection design and planning. Compared with highway traffic detections, traffic surveillance at intersections has more challenges due to the variety of road users and weaving caused by traffic conflicts. One of these problems is the detection failure of stopping road users. The other challenge is to track objects during occlusion caused by traffic conflicts. In this study, a real time video surveillance system is developed to detect, track and classify road users at intersections. At first, an improved Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is utilized to detect road users, including temporary stopping objects due to traffic conflicts. Then, a motion estimation approach is used to get the trajectories of road users. Finally, the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is employed to classify pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles.

The model included a deep convolutional network structure which can steadily extract the visual features of citrus under natural environment, a deep pool structure which can extract high-level semantic features to get citrus feature map, a citrus location prediction model based on non-maximum suppression method. Moreover, the proposed model was trained by transfer learning method.

A suspicious multi-object detection and recognition method for millimeter wave sar security inspection images based on multi-path extraction network,NO,,,,"There are several major challenges in detecting and recognizing multiple hidden objects from millimeter wave SAR security inspection images: inconsistent clarity of objects, similar objects, and complex background interference. To address these problems, a suspicious multi-object detection and recognition method based on the Multi-Path Extraction Network (MPEN) is proposed. In MPEN, You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 is used as the base network, and then the Multi-Path Feature Pyramid (MPFP) module and modified residual block distribution are proposed. MPFP is designed to output the deep network feature layers separately. Then, to distinguish similar objects more easily, the residual block distribution is modified to improve the ability of the shallow network to capture details. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the millimeter wave SAR images from the laboratorys self-developed security inspection system are utilized in conducting research on multi-object detection and recognition.

Although a number of annotated corpora have been established to facilitate data-driven grammatical error detection and correction approaches, they are still limited in terms of quantity and coverage because human annotation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. In this work, we propose to utilize unlabeled data to train neural network based grammatical error detection models. The basic idea is to cast error detection as a binary classification problem and derive positive and negative training examples from unlabeled data.

Supervised novelty detection in brain tissue classification with an application to white matter hyperintensities,NO,,,,"Novelty detection is concerned with identifying test data that differs from the training data of a classifier. In the case of brain MR images, pathology or imaging artefacts are examples of untrained data. In this proof-of-principle study, we measure the behaviour of a classifier during the classification of trained labels (i.e. normal brain tissue). Next, we devise a measure that distinguishes normal classifier behaviour from abnormal behavior that occurs in the case of a novelty. This will be evaluated by training a kNN classifier on normal brain tissue, applying it to images with an untrained pathology (white matter hyperintensities (WMH)), and determine if our measure is able to identify abnormal classifier behaviour at WMH locations. For our kNN classifier, behaviour is modelled as the mean, median, or q1 distance to the k nearest points. Healthy tissue was trained on 15 images; classifier behaviour was trained/tested on 5 images with leave-one-out cross-validation. For each trained class, we measure the distribution of mean/median/q1 distances to the k nearest point. Next, for each test voxel, we compute its Z-score with respect to the measured distribution of its predicted label. We consider a Z-score 4 abnormal behaviour of the classifier, having a probability due to chance of 0.000032. Our measure identified >90% of WMH volume and also highlighted other non-trained findings. The latter being predominantly vessels, cerebral falx, brain mask errors, choroid plexus.

Image synthesis algorithm for road object detection in rainy weather,NO,,,,"In a bad weather environment, the existing road object-detection algorithms using deep learning seldom properly detect road objects in fog, rain, and/or snow. This is due to the lack of data on bad weather environments in the well-known training data, but there is little or no bad weather data that can actually be employed. In this paper, we propose a method to synthesize rain in road images as training data for road object detection in bad weather environments. The proposed method is composed of fog synthesis and rain streak generation. The fog synthesis step estimates and corrects the fog transmission value using depth information from a clear image, and expresses a fog-like feature of the real road image through Gaussian filtering and temporal filtering. We also generate rain streaks using the Unity3D program. We experimented with detecting road objects by learning synthesized rainy images and original rain-free images before synthesis, and compared the two results. Thus, we confirmed that learning with rain-synthesized images improves the detection rate by up to 53%. Experimental results also show that the proposed method can improve vehicle detection performance by about 3.5%, even with real, rainy videos.

Automatic Detection and Classification of Laser Welding Defects,NO,,,,"Laser welding is one of the most common methods used in joining metal materials. However, welding errors are usually encountered during the welding process due to external factors. The detection and correct classification of these welding faults are of great importance for the reliability of the weld and the material which was welded. Traditionally, welding error detection is usually handed by visual inspection. However, visual inspection is an error-prone and slow process. In this study, an image processing and machine learning based method is proposed to automatically detect welding defects. The welded materials are divided into sub-images and each sub-image is examined for defect detection and defect type classification. The study has been examined in 2 aspects as 2-class classification and 3- class classification. As a result of the study, an average of 90% precision is obtained with Logistic Regression (LR) and 91% precision is obtained with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the 2-class classification process. As for the 3-class classification, an average of 91% precision is obtained with the LR, and 93% precision values are obtained with the SVM.  2021 IEEE.","Kan, Yusuf Can; Kalkan, Habil",10.1109/ASYU52992.2021.9599064,conferencePaper,H89S7PVY,2021,,1

Marathon bib number recognition using deep learning,NO,,,,"Bib number recognition (BNR) from unstructured marathon images can be a challenging task. This is because the images captured at these events are very inconsistent since, they are often captured by multiple photographers, at various locations and times. This results in images containing different backgrounds, angles and illumination. The images often contain multiple participants in various poses, where the bib numbers can be obstructed by the participants themselves. The bib numbers are often printed on flexible paper and can easily be deformed which distorts the printed numbers. In this work we present a BNR system based on deep learning which is able to locate bib numbers in unstructured, complex marathon images. Using the segmented bib numbers the system then, recognizes the digits and finally outputs the bib numbers that it was able to detect in the image. The first stage consists of a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to segment the bib numbers while the second stage consists of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) used to recognize the detected numbers.

A deep learning approach for the analysis of masses in mammograms with minimal user intervention,NO,,,,"We present an integrated methodology for detecting, segmenting and classifying breast masses from mammograms with minimal user intervention. This is a long standing problem due to low signal-to-noise ratio in the visualisation of breast masses, combined with their large variability in terms of shape, size, appearance and location. We break the problem down into three stages: mass detection, mass segmentation, and mass classification. For the detection, we propose a cascade of deep learning methods to select hypotheses that are refined based on Bayesian optimisation. For the segmentation, we propose the use of deep structured output learning that is subsequently refined by a level set method. Finally, for the classification, we propose the use of a deep learning classifier, which is pre-trained with a regression to hand-crafted feature values and fine-tuned based on the annotations of the breast mass classification dataset. We test our proposed system on the publicly available INbreast dataset and compare the results with the current state-of-the-art methodologies. This evaluation shows that our system detects 90% of masses at 1 false positive per image, has a segmentation accuracy of around 0.85 (Dice index) on the correctly detected masses, and overall classifies masses as malignant or benign with sensitivity (Se) of 0.98 and specificity (Sp) of 0.7.  2017 Elsevier B.V.","Dhungel, Neeraj; Carneiro, Gustavo; Bradley, Andrew P.",10.1016/j.media.2017.01.009,journalArticle,X2YGG5ED,2017,,1

Traffic Sign Recognition on Video Sequence using Deep Neural Networks and Matching Algorithm,NO,,,,"The paper analyzes data sets containing images with labeled traffic signs, as well as modern approaches for their detection and classification on images of urban scenes. Particular attention is paid to the recognition of Russian types of traffic signs. Various modern architectures of deep neural networks for the simultaneous object detection and classification were studied, including Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet. To increase the efficiency of neural network recognition of objects in a video sequence, the Seq-BBox Matching algorithm is used. Training and testing of the proposed approach was carried out on Russian Traffic Sign Dataset and IceVision Dataset containing over 150 types of road signs and more than 65,000 marked images. For all the approaches considered, quality metrics are defined: mean average precision mAP, mean average recall mAR and processing time of one frame. The highest quality performance was demonstrated by the architecture of Faster R-CNN with Seq-BBox Matching, while the highest performance is provided by the architecture of RetinaNet. Implementation was carried out using the Python 3.7 programming language and PyTorch deep learning library using NVidia CUDA technology. Performance indicators were obtained on the workstation with the NVidia Tesla V-100 32GB video card. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of applying the proposed approach both for the resource-intensive procedure for automated labeling of road scene images for new data sets preparation, and for traffic sign recognition in on-board computer vision systems of unmanned vehicles.  2019 IEEE.","Belkin, Ilya; Tkachenko, Sergey; Yudin, Dmitry",10.1109/IC-AIAI48757.2019.00013,conferencePaper,SU5GX9QE,2019,,1

Single Shot MultiBox Detector for Urban Plantation Single Tree Detection and Location With High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery,NO,,,,"Using high-resolution remote sensing images to automatically identify individual trees is of great significance to forestry ecological environment monitoring. Urban plantation has realistic demands for single tree management such as catkin pollution, maintenance of famous trees, landscape construction, and park management. At present, there are problems of missed detection and error detection in dense plantations and complex background plantations. This paper proposes a single tree detection method based on single shot multibox detector (SSD). Optimal SSD is obtained by adjusting feature layers, optimizing the aspect ratio of a preset box, reducing parameters and so on. The optimal SSD is applied to single tree detection and location in campuses, orchards, and economic plantations. The average accuracy based on SSD is 96.0, 92.9, and 97.6% in campus green trees, lychee plantations, and palm plantations, respectively. It is 11.3 and 37.5% higher than the latest template matching method and chan-vese (CV) model method, and is 43.1 and 54.2% higher than the traditional watershed method and local maximum method. Experimental results show that SSD has a strong potential and application advantage. This research has reference significance for the application of an object detection framework based on deep learning in agriculture and forestry.

Assisted phase and step annotation for surgical videos,NO,,,,"Purpose Annotation of surgical videos is a time-consuming task which requires specific knowledge. In this paper, we present and evaluate a deep learning-based method that includes pre-annotation of the phases and steps in surgical videos and user assistance in the annotation process. Methods We propose a classification function that automatically detects errors and infers temporal coherence in predictions made by a convolutional neural network. First, we trained three different architectures of neural networks to assess the method on two surgical procedures: cholecystectomy and cataract surgery. The proposed method was then implemented in an annotation software to test its ability to assist surgical video annotation. A user study was conducted to validate our approach, in which participants had to annotate the phases and the steps of a cataract surgery video. The annotation and the completion time were recorded. Results The participants who used the assistance system were 7% more accurate on the step annotation and 10 min faster than the participants who used the manual system. The results of the questionnaire showed that the assistance system did not disturb the participants and did not complicate the task. Conclusion The annotation process is a difficult and time-consuming task essential to train deep learning algorithms. In this publication, we propose a method to assist the annotation of surgical workflows which was validated through a user study. The proposed assistance system significantly improved annotation duration and accuracy.","Lecuyer, G.; Ragot, M.; Martin, N.; Launay, L.; Jannin, P.",10.1007/s11548-019-02108-8,journalArticle,VA72K4GH,2020,,1
Delving into localization errors for monocular 3d object detection,NO,,,,"Estimating 3D bounding boxes from monocular images is an essential component in autonomous driving, while accurate 3D object detection from this kind of data is very challenging. In this work, by intensive diagnosis experiments, we quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found the 'localization error' is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides, we also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors, analyze the issues they might bring, and propose three strategies. First, we revisit the misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center of the 3D object, which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy. Second, we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing technologies is almost impossible, while those samples will mislead the learned network. To this end, we propose to remove such samples from the training set for improving the overall performance of the detector. Lastly, we also propose a novel 3D IoU oriented loss for the size estimation of the object, which is not affected by 'localization error'. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, where the proposed method achieves real-time detection and outperforms previous methods by a large margin.

We evaluate this score on a traffic sign classifier and find that it achieves near state-of-the-art performance, while being significantly faster to compute than other confidence scores.

Are image-agnostic universal adversarial perturbations for face recognition difficult to detect?,NO,,,,"High performance of deep neural network based systems have attracted many applications in object recognition and face recognition. However, researchers have also demonstrated them to be highly sensitive to adversarial perturbation and hence, tend to be unreliable and lack robustness. While most of the research on adversarial perturbation focuses on image specific attacks, recently, image-agnostic Universal perturbations are proposed which learn the adversarial pattern over training distribution and have broader impact on real-world security applications. Such adversarial attacks can have compounding effect on face recognition where these visually imperceptible attacks can cause mismatches. To defend against adversarial attacks, sophisticated detection approaches are prevalent but most of the existing approaches do not focus on image-agnostic attacks. In this paper, we present a simple but efficient approach based on pixel values and Principal Component Analysis as features coupled with a Support Vector Machine as the classifier, to detect image-agnostic universal perturbations. We also present evaluation metrics, namely adversarial perturbation class classification error rate, original class classification error rate, and average classification error rate, to estimate the performance of adversarial perturbation detection algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a 32- layer convolutional neural Networks (CNNs) in to improve the efficiency of preprocess and reuse the features by concatenating all features from the previous layers with the same featuremap size, thus improve the flow of information and gradient. The shared features and bottleneck layers further improve the feature propagation and reduce the CNN model parameters dramatically.

Fiducial marker recovery and detection from severely truncated data in navigation-assisted spine surgery,NO,,,,"Purpose: Fiducial markers are commonly used in navigation-assisted minimally invasive spine surgery and they help transfer image coordinates into real-world coordinates. In practice, these markers might be located outside the field-of-view (FOV) of C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems used in intraoperative surgeries, due to the limited detector sizes. As a consequence, reconstructed markers in CBCT volumes suffer from artifacts and have distorted shapes, which sets an obstacle fornavigation. Methods: In this work, we propose two fiducial marker detection methods: direct detection from distorted markers (direct method) and detection after marker recovery (recovery method). For direct detection from distorted markers in reconstructed volumes, an efficient automatic marker detection method using two neural networks and a conventional circle detection algorithm is proposed. For marker recovery, a task-specific data preparation strategy is proposed to recover markers from severely truncated data. Afterwards, a conventional marker detection algorithm is applied for position detection. The networks in both methods are trained based on simulated data. For the direct method, 6800 images and 10000 images are generated, respectively, to train the U-Net and ResNet50. For the recovery method, the training set includes 1360 images for FBPConvNet and Pix2pixGAN. The simulated data set with 166 markers and four cadaver cases with real fiducials are used forevaluation. Results: The two methods are evaluated on simulated data and real cadaver data. The direct method achieves 100% detection rates within 1mm detection error on simulated data with normal truncation and simulated data with heavier noise, but only detect 94.6% markers in extremely severe truncation case. The recovery method detects all the markers successfully in three test data sets and around 95% markers are detected within 0.5mm error. For real cadaver data, both methods achieve 100% marker detection rates with mean registration error below 0.2mm.

Bleeding Classification of Enhanced Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images using Deep Convolutional Neural Network,NO,,,,"This paper investigates the performance of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) algorithm to identify bleeding areas of wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images without known prior knowledge of bleeding and normal features of the images. In this study, a pre-processing technique has been proposed to improve the classification accuracy of WCE images into bleeding areas and normal areas by enhancing the WCE images. The proposed technique is applied to WCE images from six cases and divided into one training case and five test cases. To evaluate the effectiveness of the processes, the results were then compared between DCNN, SVM and Fuzzy, and also between DCNN with completely enhanced images and DCNN with normalized images. DCNN has shown to give a better result compared to SVM and Fuzzy logic; and the latter experiment has shown that the WCE images that have undergone the proposed enhancement technique gives better classification result compared to those images that did not go through the technique. The specificity, sensitivity and average are 0.8703, 0.8271 and 0.8907 respectively. In conclusion, DCNN has been proven to be able to successfully detecting bleeding areas from images without having any specific knowledge on imaging diagnosis or pathology.  2020 Institute of Information Science.

Automatic teat detection for rotary milking system based on deep learning algorithms,NO,,,,"In dairy farming, the milking process is the most labor-intensive activity. In order to automate the milking process, we acquire cows udder images in the working conditions of the rotary milking system to establish the udder image dataset. According to the characteristics of the dataset, rotated bounding boxes are used to label the teats. An arbitrary-oriented object detection framework R2Faster R-CNN is used to develop the teat detection model. The AP of the model is 80.41%, the mean orientation error is 2.29, and the detection time is 0.19 s per image. In addition, R2Faster R-CNN algorithm can detect overlapped or partially occluded teats, and has high stability under actual rotary milking system environment. Finally, an automatic milking device is built to perform teat cup attachment experiments in the laboratory environment. Among the 20 groups experiments, all teats are detected correctly, the average refresh time is 0.39 s.

Insulator detection and recognition of explosion based on convolutional neural networks,NO,,,,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high definition (HD) cameras can obtain a large number of detailed inspection images. The insulator is an indispensable component in the transmission lines. Detecting insulator in image video quickly and accurately can provide a reliable basis for the ranging and the obstacle avoidance flight of UAV close to the tower and transmission line. At the same time, the insulator is a serious threat to the safety of the power grid due to the multiple faults of the insulator, and the computer technology should be fully utilized to diagnose the fault. Detection of the insulator images with the complex aerial background is implemented by constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has the classic architecture of five modules of convolution and pooling, two modules of fully connected layers. In this paper, we propose a recognition algorithm for explosion fault based on saliency detection, which uses the trained network model to extract the features. Then, we put the saliency maps into a self-organizing feature map (SOM) network and build the mathematical module via super pixel segmentation, contour detection and other image processing methods. The test shows that the algorithm can reduce the error that may be caused by manual analysis. It also demonstrates that the detection of the insulator and the recognition of explosion fault can effectively improve the efficiency and intelligence level.  2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Yan, Bin; Chen, Qing; Ye, Run; Zhou, Xiaojia",10.1142/S0219691319400083,journalArticle,ARIGB9DP,2019,,1

Fusing multimodal video data for detecting moving objects/targets in challenging indoor and outdoor scenes,NO,,,,"Single sensor systems and standard optical-usually RGB CCTV video cameras-fail to provide adequate observations, or the amount of spectral information required to build rich, expressive, discriminative features for object detection and tracking tasks in challenging outdoor and indoor scenes under various environmental/illumination conditions. Towards this direction, we have designed a multisensor system based on thermal, shortwave infrared, and hyperspectral video sensors and propose a processing pipeline able to perform in real-time object detection tasks despite the huge amount of the concurrently acquired video streams. In particular, in order to avoid the computationally intensive coregistration of the hyperspectral data with other imaging modalities, the initially detected targets are projected through a local coordinate system on the hypercube image plane. Regarding the object detection, a detector-agnostic procedure has been developed, integrating both unsupervised (background subtraction) and supervised (deep learning convolutional neural networks) techniques for validation purposes. The detected and verified targets are extracted through the fusion and data association steps based on temporal spectral signatures of both target and background. The quite promising experimental results in challenging indoor and outdoor scenes indicated the robust and efficient performance of the developed methodology under different conditions like fog, smoke, and illumination changes.  2019 by the authors.","Kandylakis, Zacharias; Vasili, Konstantinos; Karantzalos, Konstantinos",10.3390/rs11040446,journalArticle,U23A2YXQ,2019,,1
Discriminative feature learning constrained unsupervised network for cloud detection in remote sensing imagery,NO,,,,"Cloud detection is a significant preprocessing step for increasing the exploitability of remote sensing imagery that faces various levels of difficulty due to the complexity of underlying surfaces, insufficient training data, and redundant information in high-dimensional data. To solve these problems, we propose an unsupervised network for cloud detection (UNCD) on multispectral (MS) and hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing images. The UNCD method enforces discriminative feature learning to obtain the residual error between the original input and the background in deep latent space, which is based on the observation that clouds are sparse and modeled as sparse outliers in remote sensing imagery. The UNCD enforces discriminative feature learning to obtain the residual error between the original input and the background in deep latent space, which is based on the observation that clouds are sparse and modeled as sparse outliers in remote sensing imagery. First, a compact representation of the original imagery is obtained by a latent adversarial learning constrained encoder. Meanwhile, the majority class with sufficient samples (i.e., background pixels) is more accurately reconstructed than the clouds with limited samples by the decoder. An image discriminator is used to prevent the generalization of out-of-class features caused by latent adversarial learning. To further highlight the background information in the deep latent space, a multivariate Gaussian distribution is introduced. In particular, the residual error with clouds highlighted and background samples suppressed is applied in the cloud detection in deep latent space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed UNCD method, experiments were conducted on both MS and HS datasets that were captured by various sensors over various scenes, and the results demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. The sensors that captured the datasets include Landsat 8, GaoFen-1 (GF-1), and GaoFen-5 (GF-5). Landsat 8 was launched at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on 11 February 2013, in a mission that was initially known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). China launched the GF-1 satellite. The GF-5 satellite captures hyperspectral observations in the Chinese Key Projects of High-Re solution Earth Observation System. The overall accuracy (OA) values for Images I and II from the Landsat 8 dataset were 0.9526 and 0.9536, respectively, and the OA values for Images III and IV from the GF-1 wide field of view (WFV) dataset were 0.9957 and 0.9934, respectively. Hence, the proposed method outperformed the other considered methods.  2020 by the authors.","Xie, Weiying; Yang, Jian; Li, Yunsong; Lei, Jie; Zhong, Jiaping; Li, Jiaojiao",10.3390/rs12030456,journalArticle,UA5XXVYV,2020,,1

Deep learning of contrast-coated serrated polyps for computer-aided detection in CT colonography,NO,,,,"Serrated polyps were previously believed to be benign lesions with no cancer potential. However, recent studies have revealed a novel molecular pathway where also serrated polyps can develop into colorectal cancer. CT colonography (CTC) can detect serrated polyps using the radiomic biomarker of contrast coating, but this requires expertise from the reader and current computer-aided detection (CADe) systems have not been designed to detect the contrast coating. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel CADe method that makes use of deep learning to detect serrated polyps based on their contrast-coating biomarker in CTC. In the method, volumetric shape-based features are used to detect polyp sites over soft-tissue and fecal-tagging surfaces of the colon. The detected sites are imaged using multi-angular 2D image patches. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used to review the image patches for the presence of polyps. The DCNN-based polyp-likelihood estimates are merged into an aggregate likelihood index where highest values indicate the presence of a polyp. For pilot evaluation, the proposed DCNN-CADe method was evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation scheme using 101 colonoscopy-confirmed cases with 144 biopsy-confirmed serrated polyps from a CTC screening program, where the patients had been prepared for CTC with saline laxative and fecal tagging by barium and iodine-based diatrizoate. The average per-polyp sensitivity for serrated polyps 6 mm in size was 937% at 0:81:8 false positives per patient on average. The detection accuracy was substantially higher that of a conventional CADe system. Our results indicate that serrated polyps can be detected automatically at high accuracy in CTC.  2017 SPIE.","Nappi, Janne J.; Pickhardt, Perry; Kim, David H.; Hironaka, Toru; Yoshida, Hiroyuki",10.1117/12.2255634,conferencePaper,PCID4IAH,2017,,1
Real-time dangerous objects detection in millimeter wave images,NO,,,,"Millimeter wave imaging technology has been used in human body security inspection in public. Comparing to traditional X-ray imaging, it is more efficient and without harm to human body. Thus an automatic dangerous objects detection for millimeter wave images is useful to greatly save human labor. However, due to technology limitation, millimeter wave images are usually low resolution and with high noise, thus the dangerous objects hidden in human body are hard to be found. In addition, the detection speed is of great significance in practice. This paper proposes an efficient method for dangerous objects detection for millimeter wave images. It is based on a single unified CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). Compared to traditional region-based method like RCNN, by setting some default anchors over different aspect ratios at the last feature map, it is able to frame object detection as a regression problem to these anchors while predicting class probabilities. The model gets 70.9 mAP at 50 frames per second in millimeter wave images dataset, obtaining better performance than other method, showing a promise in practical using in the future.  2018 SPIE.","Wang, Sheng; Ye, Zuochang; Wang, Yan",10.1117/12.2502985,conferencePaper,HGJQR5JJ,2018,,1
Detection of Big Animals on Images with Road Scenes using Deep Learning,NO,,,,"The recognition of big animals on the images with road scenes has received little attention in modern research. There are very few specialized data sets for this task. Popular open data sets contain many images of big animals, but the most part of them is not correspond to road scenes that is necessary for on-board vision systems of unmanned vehicles. The paper describes the preparation of such a specialized data set based on Google Open Images and COCO datasets. The resulting data set contains about 20000 images of big animals of 10 classes: 'Bear', 'Fox', 'Dog', 'Horse', 'Goat', 'Sheep', 'Cow', 'Zebra', 'Elephant', 'Giraffe'. Deep learning approaches to detect these objects are researched in the paper. Authors trained and tested modern neural network architectures YOLOv3, RetinaNet R-50-FPN, Faster R-CNN R-50-FPN, Cascade R-CNN R-50-FPN. To compare the approaches the mean average precision (mAP) was determined at IoU50%, also their speed was calculated for input tensor sizes 640x384x3. The highest quality metrics are demonstrated by architecture YOLOv3 as for ten classes (0.78 mAP) and one joint class (0.92 mAP) detection with speed more 35 fps on NVidia Tesla V-100 32GB video card. At the same hardware, the RetinaNet R-50-FPN architecture provided recognition speed of more than 44 fps and a 13% lower mAP. The software implementation was done using the Keras and PyTorch deep learning libraries and NVidia CUDA technology. The proposed data set and neural network approach to recognizing big animals on images have shown their effectiveness and can be used in the on-board vision systems of driverless cars or in driver assistant systems.  2019 IEEE.","Yudin, Dmitry; Sotnikov, Anton; Krishtopik, Andrey",10.1109/IC-AIAI48757.2019.00028,conferencePaper,4DXXKG8X,2019,,1
Object Instance Segmentation and Fine-Grained Localization Using Hypercolumns,NO,,,,"Recognition algorithms based on convolutional networks (CNNs) typically use the output of the last layer as a feature representation. However, the information in this layer may be too coarse spatially to allow precise localization. On the contrary, earlier layers may be precise in localization but will not capture semantics. To get the best of both worlds, we define the hypercolumn at a pixel as the vector of activations of all CNN units above that pixel. Using hypercolumns as pixel descriptors, we show results on three fine-grained localization tasks: simultaneous detection and segmentation, where we improve state-of-the-art from 49.7 mean APr to 62.4, keypoint localization, where we get a 3.3 point boost over a strong regression baseline using CNN features, and part labeling, where we show a 6.6 point gain over a strong baseline.  1979-2012 IEEE.","Hariharan, Bharath; Arbelaez, Pablo; Girshick, Ross; Malik, Jitendra",10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2578328,journalArticle,WQUX6Y7B,2017,,1
An image processing pipeline for long range UAV detection,NO,,,,"The number of affordable consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) available on the market has been growing quickly in recent years. Uncontrolled use of such UAVs in the context of public events like sports events or demonstrations, as well as their use near sensitive areas, such as airports or correctional facilities pose a potential security threat. Automatic early detection of UAVs is thus an important task which can be addressed through multiple modalities, such as visual imagery, radar, audio signals, or UAV control signals. In this work we present an image processing pipeline which is capable of tracking very small point targets in an overview camera, adjusting a tilting unit with a mounted zoom camera (PTZ system) to locations of interest and classifying the spotted object in this more detailed camera view. The overview camera is a high-resolution camera with a wide field of view. Its main purpose is to monitor a wide area and to allow an early detection of candidates, whose motion or appearance warrant a closer investigation. In a subsequent process these candidates are prioritized and successively examined by adapting the orientation of the tilting unit and the zoom level of the attached camera lens, to be able to observe the target in detail and provide appropriate data for the classification stage. The image of the PTZ camera is then used to classify the object into either UAV class or distractor class. For this task we apply the popular SSD detector. Several parameters of the detector have been adapted for the task of UAV detection and classification. We demonstrate the performance of the full pipeline on imagery collected by the system. The data contains actual UAVs as well as distractors, such as birds.  COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Product surface defect detection based on CNN ensemble with rejection,NO,,,,"Deep learning-based pattern recognition has achieved impressive accuracy recently. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to solving various practical problems. One such problem is image-based product defect inspection. Product quality inspection is an essential step in a production line. So far, this task has been conducted primarily by human inspectors, but the inspection results are often affected by various human factors such as experience, health conditions, attention, and so on. CNN can be useful for reducing human factors and thus can be good for quality control. In practice, however, CNN-based defect detection is still a challenging task. One reason is that a single false negative (FN) error (i.e., classifying a defect as a normal case) may be a liability for a company, and this is the crucial difference between image recognition and defect detection. To reduce the FN error rate, in this study, we investigate the effect of 'rejection' for defect detection. Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN ensemble with a proper rejection rate can have a very low FN error rate and can reduce human labor significantly.  2019 IEEE.","Su, Kai; Zhao, Qiangfu; Lien, Po Chun",10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech.2019.00067,conferencePaper,7FLGG96R,2019,,1
Object detection and localization using deep convolutional networks with softmax activation and multi-class log loss,NO,,,,"We introduce a deep neural network that can be used to localize and detect a region of interest (ROI) in an image.

Most localization networks regress a bounding box around the region of interest. Unlike these architecture, we treat the problem as a classification problem where each pixel in the image is a separate class. The network is trained on images along with masks which indicate where the object is in the image. We treat the problem as a multi-class classification.

Real-time object detection system for building energy conservation: An IP camera based system,NO,,,,"In the contemporary world, there is a rapid introduction of automated and intelligent building systems. These technologies offer new and exciting opportunities to increase the connectivity of devices in built environments, particularly for energy conservation. Most of the developed building energy conservation systems are based on sensors, thus, the application of those systems is limited to small spaces due to maintainability issues. The reliability of these sensor-based systems is still argued as sensors are not capable enough for multi-person tracking and real-time object detection. Giving emphasis to these limitations, the current study introduces a realtime object detection, tracking and counting system for building energy conservation particularly, for HVAC and lighting based on IP CCTV cameras. An experimental research design was employed for the study. Initially, CCTV images from three objects: human heads, lighted vehicles, and non-lighted vehicles were collected from 12 offices. Subsequently, these objects were trained using the machine learning and the real-time object detection was performed using a Single Shot Detector model. The proposed system was developed using the Python programming language. The developed system comprised of three basic features namely, object detection, object tracking and counting, and HVAC and lighting control. This system enables real-time object classification for human heads, lighted vehicles, and non-lighted vehicles, therefore, reduces excessive energy consumed by air conditioning and lighting depending on the nature and movements of the objects. With the use of this system, facility managers can make built environments much comfortable for occupants while deducting excessive energy consumption and human effort taken to manage comfort levels of buildings.

A Fast Detection Method for Safety States of Power Receiving Device on High-Speed Rail Based on Deep Learning,NO,,,,"A fast and accurate method to detect and locate pantographs is proposed to solve the safety problem of railways caused by pantograph missing or serious deformation. The deep learning based method firstly uses 10,000 images captured by the camera in front of the high-speed rail pantograph as training samples to perform offline training and to generate a CNN prediction model. Then the model and the improved YOLOv2 are used to implement online testing to the pantograph through the image captured by the camera. Test results are finally returned by a program and an early warning of phenomenons of pantograph loss or severe deformation is provided. Results show that the proposed method detects the pantograph in real time with a detection speed of 55 frames per second on a CPU platform while the average accurate rate is 93.1%.  2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Binocular vision calibration method for a long-wavelength infrared camera and a visible spectrum camera with different resolutions,NO,,,,"We present a calibration plate for the binocular vision system, which is composed of a long-wavelength infrared camera and a visible spectrum camera with different resolutions. The calibration plate mainly consists of a white low-temperature aluminum plate with 77 round through-holes, a black high-temperature stainless steel plate, and a heating plate. It can be captured by the long-wavelength infrared camera and visible spectrum camera simultaneously. In order to reduce the influence of thermal crosstalk on the edge and angle sharpness of the thermal image of the chessboard calibration plate, we use the round through-holes to replace the black-white squares in the chessboard calibration plate. Based on the fabricated calibration plate, we also propose a related calibration method. The proposed method can quickly detect the calibration plate by using the YOLO-V4 neural network. The affine transformation is performed to get the front view of the calibration plate, and a novel circular detection strategy based on arc level instead of pixel-level is adopted to detect the edges of the round through-holes in the calibration plate. The centers of round through-holes are detected, and the parameters of the cameras are calculated according to the coordinates of the centers in the image coordinate system. The simulation experiments and error analysis have been done to verify the centers detection method. The simulation results show that the error of center detection is always less than 1.4 (pixel). In order to further verify the performance of the calibration plate and the proposed calibration method, a binocular vision system based on long-wavelength infrared camera and visible spectrum camera is fabricated, and the verification experiments have been done. In experiments, our calibration plate and the proposed method are compared with the famous Zhang's method. The calibration's average overall mean errors of the visible spectrum camera and long-wavelength infrared camera are about 0.0126 (pixel) and 0.0238 (pixel), and they are respectively decreased by 78.13% and 81.93% compared with Zhang's method. The re-projection error of the binocular vision system is about 0.548 (pixel), which is decreased by 24.52% compared with Zhang's method.

"Fast mode decision in HEVC intra prediction, using region wise CNN feature classification",NO,,,,"The computational time of HEVC encoder is increased mainly because of hierarchical quadtree based structure, recursive search for finding best coding units (CU), and the exhaustive prediction mode search upto 35.

Focused Learning and Proofreading for Delineation of Curvilinear Structures [arXiv],NO,,,,"Many state-of-the-art delineation methods rely on supervised machine learning algorithms. As a result, they require manually annotated training data, which is tedious to obtain. Furthermore, even minor classification errors may significantly affect the topology of the final result. In this paper we propose a unified approach to address both of these problems by taking into account the influence of a potential misclassification on the resulting delineation. In an Active Learning context, we find parts of linear structures that should be annotated first in order to train an effective classifier. In a proofreading context, we similarly find regions of the resulting reconstruction that should be verified in priority to obtain a nearly-perfect result. In both cases, by focusing the attention of the human expert on the potential classification mistakes, which are the most critical parts of the delineation, we reduce the amount of annotation effort.

Fabric defect detection based on faster RCNN,NO,,,,"Considering that the traditional detection of fabric defect can be time-consuming and less-efficient, a modified faster regional-based convolutional network method (Faster RCNN) based on the VGG structure is proposed. In the paper, we improved the Faster RCNN to suit our fabric defect dataset. In order to reduce the influence of input data for Faster RCNN, we expanded the fabric defect data. Meanwhile, by taking the characteristics of the fabric defect images, we reduce the number of anchors in the Faster RCNN. In the process of training the network, VGG16 can extract the feature map through the 13 conv layers in which the activation function is Relu, and four pooling layers. Then, the region proposal network (RPN) generates the foreground anchors and bounding box regression, and then calculates the proposals. Finally, the ROI Pooling layer uses the proposals from the feature maps to extract the proposal feature into the subsequent full connection and softmax network for classification.

The estimated PSF is used for deblurring of input radial blurred images.

Context is key: grammatical error detection with contextual word representations [arXiv],text,,,,"Grammatical error detection (GED) in non-native writing requires systems to identify a wide range of errors in text written by language learners. Error detection as a purely supervised task can be challenging, as GED datasets are limited in size and the label distributions are highly imbalanced. Contextualized word representations offer a possible solution, as they can efficiently capture compositional information in language and can be optimized on large amounts of unsupervised data. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison of ELMo, BERT and Flair embeddings (Peters et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Akbik et al., 2018) on a range of public GED datasets, and propose an approach to effectively integrate such representations in current methods, achieving a new state of the art on GED.

Detecting gan generated errors,NO,,,,"Despite an impressive performance from the latest GAN for generating hyper-realistic images, GAN discriminators have difficulty evaluating the quality of an individual generated sample. This is because the task of evaluating the quality of a generated image differs from deciding if an image is real or fake. A generated image could be perfect except in a single area but still be detected as fake. Instead, we propose a novel approach for detecting where errors occur within a generated image. By collaging real images with generated images, we compute for each pixel, whether it belongs to the real distribution or generated distribution. Furthermore, we leverage attention to model long-range dependency; this allows detection of errors which are reasonable locally but not holistically. For evaluation, we show that our error detection can act as a quality metric for an individual image, unlike FID and IS. We leverage Improved Wasserstein, BigGAN, and StyleGAN to show a ranking based on our metric correlates impressively with FID scores.

Piston error detection technology for optical sparse aperture system via transfer learning,NO,,,,"Optical sparse aperture systems often need to correct the piston error between sub-apertures to obtain high-resolution imaging quality. This paper constructs a deep convolutional neural network via transfer learning to perform piston error sensing on a single focal plane image. First, a batch of data sets that introduce piston error generates according to the principle of sparse aperture imaging. The image features are extracted through the pre-training network, and the mapping relationship between the features and the corresponding piston error values is established. When a given single image is sent to the network for processing, then get corresponding piston error value via search with the nearest neighbors. The simulation results verify the method's effectiveness and measure the piston error of the 1 dynamic range. Because this detection method can perform piston error sensing tasks without introducing additional measuring equipment, it dramatically reduces the complexity and hardware cost of the optical system.

Fine-grained lung nodule segmentation with pyramid deconvolutional neural network,NO,,,,"An improved pyramid deconvolutional neural network is proposed to fine-grained segment pulmonary nodules of CT scan images. The fully convolutional neural network (FCN) can train images end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel, realizing object detection, segmentation and classification in one single CNN structure. However, the original FCN is utilized by the natural object tasks, which can hardly maintain the precision degree required by the medical images. To further improve the detection precision and segment accuracy, we improve the FCN by fusing more pooling layers, because the deconvolution of higher convolution layers give the coarser segmentations and lower convolution layers generate detail contour. The experiment is based on LIDC-IDRI datasets. Tenfold cross-validation is used to train and evaluate the performance. The experiment shows that the detection precise and the fineness of segmentation ascend with the number of the fused pooling layers. The detection rate can be achieved as high as 0.931  0.042. Meanwhile, for the segmentation performance evaluation, the score of intersection over Union (IoU) is applied, reaching 0.628  0.065. And the overlap rate (i.e. the overlap percentage of the segment result compared with the original label) is also calculated.

An algorithm for calculating the degree of similarity between English words through the different position and appearance coefficients of letters,NO,,,,"The concept of ""near-form words"" has existed since the ancient English period (about 450years ago), yet few mathematical identification algorithms have been applied to these. With the widespread use of English and an increasing number of English words, near-form words have also increased. However, the traditional way of identifying near-form words cannot keep up with this ever-growing language. A mathematical algorithm is therefore needed which can calculate the degree of similarity between words, so that near-form words can then be identified, collected and classified according to appearance similarity, and a specific value can be assigned to these levels of similarity. In related fields, there have been many studies of English synonyms, phonetic words, English sentences and texts. Some algorithms have been used with the aim of studying similarities in word appearance, but these were for hieroglyphics, such as Chinese words, and not for English words. Many similar words can be found in dictionaries or networks which are incomplete due to the outcomes of subjective collection. More importantly, subjective collection methods cannot determine the value of similarities, which highlights the uniqueness and innovation of this research. Among existing research methods, the one used most often involves fuzzy neural networks, which are unstable and inaccurate. A stable and unique mathematical calculation method is therefore needed. In this study, coding methods were used to design an algorithm that could calculate different letter position coefficients and letter appearance coefficients in order to obtain corresponding values. In terms of application, this algorithm can help generate big data on near-form words in English teaching. In terms of English input software, this algorithm can also provide more words to prompt the input method. In the case of text-editing software (such as Microsoft Word), the algorithm can improve error-detection accuracy and suggest suitable alternatives. In the field of artificial intelligence, it can also be used to monitor counterfeit trademark registration in the commodity registration system. Thus, the authors firmly believe that this application will have a wide range of applications in the future.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ruan, Chunyan; Qu, Wen; Luo, Jianfeng; Lu, Kuan-Han",10.1007/s11227-022-04511-6,journalArticle,MH8GT8BQ,2022,,1

Design and Test of Detecting System for Impurities in Walnut Based on Full Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm,NO,,,,"Aiming to solve the needs of foreign matter detection in walnut production line, a set of walnut impurity detection equipment was designed and built based on the existing universal walnut processing production line, including portable frame, image acquisition system, and constant light source system. The overall size was 470 mm600 mm615 mm. Walnuts from Zhejiang Province and impurities, including leaves, stones, paper, screws and fabric were photographed as detection objects by industrial camera above the production line in real time for intuitive image information data. An image segmentation technology combined with deep learning and computer vision, and the fully convolutional network (FCN) algorithm were applied to detect impurities that might occur in walnut production and processing. According to the test, the accuracy for detection and classification of walnut and foreign body was effective, which was 92.75% of training set and 90.35% of testing set. The speed of production line was 1 m/s. The recognition speed of detecting was 4.28 f/s, which can meet the requirements of real-time detecting of impurities. The biggest error was in the ""walnut-background"", where original walnut was predicted to be the background. The main reason was that some features in walnuts (such as cracks and lines) were similar to the background. Focusing on the analysis of foreign body error, it showed that impurities were mis-predicted as the ""background"" much more than the impurities were mis-predicted as the ""walnut"". Two main reasons led to this difference. On the one hand, when labelling manually, the pollutants on the conveyor belt were not judged as foreign bodies. On the other hand, because the size of impurities was generally small and the cardinality of pixel points was insufficient, the influence of false prediction was greater, thus amplifying the error. The reliability of the model was good. Even if the artificial labeling error occurred, walnut was mislabeled as impurities, but the trained model could still distinguish walnut and adjacent impurities well. The method proposed was worthy of further study for the online detection of impurities in automatic production of walnut, and it was of great significance to broaden the market of nut food and improve its economic benefits.  2022, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Such types of verifications are not possible in the current time due to the development of varieties of advanced image editing tools like Corel draw, Photoshop, GIMP, etc. These are low cost and open-source tools for the users and frequently used to make memes on social media websites. This paper presents an image forgery detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs/ConvNet). The error level analysis (ELA) method is discussed in detail for image forgery detection. The binary decision of CNN-based model helps in declaration of an image aptness for official uses. The CNN model has been trained for the Kaggle dataset and detailed simulations have been carried out to validate the accuracy and precision of the proposed model.

Simple Stereo Matching Algorithm for Localising Keypoints in a Restricted Search Space,NO,,,,"Modern stereo matching algorithms generally rely on matching image features such as colour and texture to find corresponding matches between images. They can provide very good results but be very computationally intensive. However, in cases where the objects to be localised lie approximately on a known plane, a much simpler algorithm can be applied. One such case is localising kiwifruit in modern orchards, as the plants are trained to grow in a planar structure known as a pergola. The proposed algorithm uses tight distance limits (based on orchard geometry) to reduce the search space for matching fruit to a small window. For the majority of kiwifruit, the search window is small enough to contain only one fruit in the adjacent image, giving only a single solution. In cases where there are tightly grouped fruit or false positive fruit detections adjacent to true positive fruit detections, there can be multiple potential matching solutions. To solve these, each potential solution is evaluated based on how closely it conforms to the mean object distance from camera and a solution is selected. On real world test data containing 121 image pairs, the algorithm has a 99.2 % true positive rate. Computation time was 1.97 ms per image pair.  2018 IEEE.","Seabright, Matthew; Streeter, Lee; Cree, Michael; Duke, Mike; Tighe, Rachael",10.1109/IVCNZ.2018.8634791,conferencePaper,PWRMYXRS,2018,,1
Large dynamic range curvature sensing for large-aperture active-optics survey telescope,NO,,,,"In order to ensure the imaging quality of large-aperture survey telescope under dramatic changes of external environment and realize fast alignment, the wavefront sensing system was required to cover a large dynamic range while maintaining the aberration detection accuracy. First, a set of large dynamic range alignment technology was established based on the light intensity distribution of the single-sided defocus image and curvature sensing. Both analytical formulas and machine learning methods were used to figure out the defocusing and other low-order aberrations. Then, theoretical analysis was made on the resolution accuracy of different types of aberrations. Finally, experimental verification was carried out. The results show that the defocusing detection error (take wavefront RMS variation as the criterion) is less than 5%, while the misalignment detection error is less than 15%, which meets the alignment and adjustment requirements.  2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Infrared and Laser Engineering.

Detection of aortic valve from echocardiography in real-time using convolutional neural network,NO,,,,"This study proposes the development of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for an automatic detection system using various deep learning methods for echocardiography. We tested the performance of the CNN by measuring accuracy and the effect on video frame rate to best represent the application of CNN in an actual patient echocardiography examination. The study focuses on the system detecting the aortic valve of the heart as it is clinically significant. Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) and Faster Regional based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) architectures with various feature extractors were trained on echocardiography images from 23 patients. Afterward, the detection models were tested on 5 echocardiography videos. The results showed that the Faster R-CNN Inception v2 attained the best accuracy (0.949) and F1 score (0.950). The second-best performer was SSD Inception v2 with 0.865 accuracy and 0.844 F1 score. In terms of prediction speed, SSD architectures were relatively faster and achieved mean frame rate of 34.22 frames-per-second (fps) and 27.66fps for MobileNet and Inception v2 feature extractor respectively. However, the frame rate performance loss for SSD Inception v2 was 49.71% compared to the original 55fps echocardiography video.

Fitness done right: A real-time intelligent personal trainer for exercise correction,NO,,,,"Keeping fit has been increasingly important for people nowadays. However, people may not get expected exercise results without following professional guidance while hiring personal trainers is expensive. In this paper, an effective real-time system called Fitness Done Right (FDR) is proposed for helping people exercise correctly on their own. The system includes detecting human body parts, recognizing exercise pose and detecting errors for test poses as well as giving correction advice. Generally, two branch multi-stage CNN [1] is used for training data sets in order to learn human body parts and associations. Then, considering two poses, which are plank and squat in our model, we design a detection algorithm, combining Euclidean and angle distances, to determine the pose in the image. Finally, key values for key features of the two poses are computed correspondingly in the pose error detection part, which helps give correction advice.

RED-ACE: Robust Error Detection for ASR using Confidence Embeddings,NO,,,,"ASR Error Detection (AED) models aim to post-process the output of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, in order to detect transcription errors. Modern approaches usually use text-based input, comprised solely of the ASR transcription hypothesis, disregarding additional signals from the ASR model. Instead, we utilize the ASR system's word-level confidence scores for improving AED performance. Specifically, we add an ASR Confidence Embedding (ACE) layer to the AED model's encoder, allowing us to jointly encode the confidence scores and the transcribed text into a contextualized representation. Our experiments show the benefits of ASR confidence scores for AED, their complementary effect over the textual signal, as well as the effectiveness and robustness of ACE for combining these signals.

Next, the network is used in order to segment the region of interest from the diastole and systole images.

Detecting and Mapping Video Impairments,NO,,,,"Automatically identifying the locations and severities of video artifacts without the advantage of an original reference video is a difficult task. We present a novel approach to conducting no-reference artifact detection in digital videos, implemented as an efficient and unique dual-path (parallel) excitatory/inhibitory neural network that uses a simple discrimination rule to define a bank of accurate distortion detectors. The learning engine is distortion-sensitized by pre-processing each video using a statistical image model. The overall system is able to produce full-resolution space-Time distortion maps for visualization, providing global distortion detection decisions that represent the state of the art in performance. Our model, which we call the video impairment mapper (VIDMAP), produces a first-of-A-kind full-resolution map of artifact detection probabilities. The current realization of this system is able to accurately detect and map eight of the most important artifact categories encountered during streaming video source inspection: Aliasing, video encoding corruptions, quantization, contours/banding, combing, compression, dropped frames, and upscaling artifacts. We show that it is either competitive with or significantly outperforms the previous state of the art on the whole-image artifact detection task.

Unsupervised Change Detection in Polarimetric SAR Data with the Hotelling-Lawley Trace Statistic and Minimum-Error Thresholding,NO,,,,"Increased discrimination capability provided by polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) sensors compared to single and dual polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can improve land use monitoring and change detection. This necessitates reliable change detection methods in multitemporal PolSAR datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised change detection algorithm for multilook PolSAR data. In the first step of the method, the Hotelling-Lawley trace (HLT) statistic is applied to measure the similarity of two multilook covariance matrices. As a result of this step, a scalar test statistic image is generated. Then, in the second step, a generalized Kittler and Illingworth (K&I) minimum-error thresholding algorithm is developed to perform on the test statistic image and discriminate between changed and unchanged areas. The K&I thresholding algorithm is based on the generalized Gamma distribution for statistical modeling of change and no-change classes. The proposed methodology is tested on a simulated PolSAR data and two C-band fully PolSAR datasets acquired by the uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR and RADARSAT-2 SAR satellites. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm accurately discriminates between change and no-change areas providing detection results with noticeably lower error rates and higher detection accuracy values compared to those of a CFAR-type thresholding of the HLT statistic. Also, the performance of the HLT statistic compared to the other statistics applied on the multilook polarimetric SAR data is assessed. Goodness-of-fit test results prove that the estimated generalized Gamma class conditional models adequately fit the corresponding change and no-change classes. 2008-2012 IEEE.","Ghanbari, Mohsen; Akbari, Vahid",10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2882412,journalArticle,KA8VCVQQ,2018,,1

Quantitative analysis of fatty acid value during rice storage based on olfactory visualization sensor technology,NO,,,,"Fatty acid value is one of the important indicators to judge whether aging occurs during rice storage. This study innovatively proposes to use a homemade olfactory visualization sensor to realize the quantitative determination of fatty acid value during rice storage. First, based on GCMS analysis results, 14 porphyrins and one pH indicator were preliminarily selected to prepare an olfactory visualization sensor array for obtaining odor information of rice samples of different storage periods. Then, the ant colony optimization combined with back propagation neural networks (ACO-BPNN) was used to optimize the color components of the preprocessed array difference image to obtain the best combination of color components. Finally, a back propagation neural networks (BPNN) model was established based on the optimized color component combination, and the number of hidden layer nodes of the network was optimized by using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The results showed that the best BPNN model constructed on the color component numbers 41, 11 and 34, and the optimal topology of the network was 3-12-1. The correlation coefficient (RP) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the best BPNN model were 0.9715 and 0.4310 mg/100 g, respectively. The overall results demonstrate that it is feasible to use the homemade olfactory visualization sensor to detect fatty acid values during rice storage. In addition, the ACO-BPNN can find the best color components combination, which can effectively improve the detection accuracy and stability of the BPNN model, and also reduce the cost of preparing the olfactory visualization sensor array.  2020 Elsevier B.V.","Jiang, Hui; Liu, Tong; He, Peihuan; Chen, Quansheng",10.1016/j.snb.2020.127816,journalArticle,92P3FHUL,2020,,1
"Detection of type, blended ratio, and mixed ratio of puer tea by using electronic nose and visible/near infrared spectrometer",NO,,,,"The objective of this study was to find an intelligent and fast method to detect the type, blended ratio, and mixed ratio of ancient Puer tea, which is significant in maintaining order in the Puer tea industry. An electronic nose (E-nose) and a visible near infrared spectrometer (VIS/NIR spectrometer) were applied for tea sampling. Feature extraction was conducted using both the traditional method and a convolutional neural network (CNN) technique. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were applied for pattern recognition. After sampling while using the traditional method, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed that the mean differential value of each sensor should be selected as the optimal feature extraction method for E-nose data, and raw data comparison results showed that 19 peak/valley values and two slope values were extracted. While the format of E-nose data was in accord with the input format for CNN, the VIS/NIR spectrometer data required matrixing to meet the format requirements. The LDA and PLSR analysis results showed that CNN has superior detection ability, being able to acquire more local features than the traditional method, but it has the risk of mixing in redundant information, which can act to reduce the detection ability. Multi-source information fusion (E-nose and VIS/NIR spectrometer fusion) can collect more features from different angles to improve the detection ability, but it also contains the risk of adding redundant information, which reduces the detection ability. For practical detection, the type of Puer tea should be recognizable using a VIS/NIR spectrometer and the traditional feature extraction method. The blended ratio of Puer tea should also be identifiable by using a VIS/NIR spectrometer with traditional feature extraction. Multi-source information fusion with traditional feature extraction should be used if the accuracy requirement is extremely high; otherwise, a VIS/NIR spectrometer with traditional feature extraction is preferred.  2019 by the authors.

Face Validation Based Anomaly Detection Using Variational Autoencoder,NO,,,,"In unconstrained facial images, large visual variations concerning pose, scale, the presence of occlusions, expressions and lighting usually cause difficulties in discriminating faces from the background accurately. As a result, some non-face regions are recognized as faces (false positive) and that influences the effectiveness of face detection algorithms which is characterized by low false positive (FP) rate, high detection rate and high speed of processing. In order to reduce these non-face regions, they are considered as anomalies and then try to detect them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method using reconstruction error from variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a generative machine learning model. We train VAE to learn reconstructing faces that are close to its original input faces using FDDB dataset, then the difference between the original input face and the reconstructed output is measured to obtain the reconstruction error which can be used as an anomaly score. Consequently, the regions resulting from faces detection algorithm with high reconstruction error are defined as anomalies or false positives.  2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Zeno, B.; Matveev, Yu; Alkhatib, B.",10.1088/1757-899X/618/1/012011,conferencePaper,L7JKFT4R,2019,,1
Breast cancer detection using infrared thermal imaging and a deep learning model,NO,,,,"Womens breasts are susceptible to developing cancer; this is supported by a recent study from 2016 showing that 2.8 million women worldwide had already been diagnosed with breast cancer that year. The medical care of a patient with breast cancer is costly and, given the cost and value of the preservation of the health of the citizen, the prevention of breast cancer has become a priority in public health. Over the past 20 years several techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as mammography, which is frequently used for breast cancer diagnosis. However, false positives of mammography can occur in which the patient is diagnosed positive by another technique. Additionally, the potential side effects of using mammography may encourage patients and physicians to look for other diagnostic techniques. Our review of the literature first explored infrared digital imaging, which assumes that a basic thermal comparison between a healthy breast and a breast with cancer always shows an increase in thermal activity in the precancerous tissues and the areas surrounding developing breast cancer. Furthermore, through our research, we realized that a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) undertaken through infrared image processing could not be achieved without a model such as the well-known hemispheric model.

Real-Time Gender Detection in the Wild Using Deep Neural Networks,NO,,,,"Gender recognition can be used in many applications, such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction and customized advertisement. Current state-of-the-art gender recognition methods are detector-dependent or region-dependent, focusing mostly on facial features (a face detector is typically required). These limitations do not allow an end-to-end training pipeline, and many features used in the detection phase must be re-learned in the classification step. Furthermore, the use of facial features limits the application of such methods in the wild, where the face might not be present. This paper presents a real-time end-to-end gender detector based on deep neural networks. The proposed method detects and recognizes the gender of persons in the wild, meaning in images with a high variability in pose, illumination an occlusions. To train and evaluate the results a new annotation set of Pascal VOC 2007 and CelebA were created.

ConvNet-Based Localization of Anatomical Structures in 3-D Medical Images,NO,,,,"Localization of anatomical structures is a prerequisite for many tasks in a medical image analysis. We propose a method for automatic localization of one or more anatomical structures in 3-D medical images through detection of their presence in 2-D image slices using a convolutional neural network (ConvNet). A single ConvNet is trained to detect the presence of the anatomical structure of interest in axial, coronal, and sagittal slices extracted from a 3-D image. To allow the ConvNet to analyze slices of different sizes, spatial pyramid pooling is applied. After detection, 3-D bounding boxes are created by combining the output of the ConvNet in all slices. In the experiments, 200 chest CT, 100 cardiac CT angiography (CTA), and 100 abdomen CT scans were used. The heart, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta were localized in chest CT scans, the left cardiac ventricle in cardiac CTA scans, and the liver in abdomen CT scans. Localization was evaluated using the distances between automatically and manually defined reference bounding box centroids and walls. The best results were achieved in the localization of structures with clearly defined boundaries (e.g., aortic arch) and the worst when the structure boundary was not clearly visible (e.g., liver). The method was more robust and accurate in localization multiple structures.  1982-2012 IEEE.","De Vos, Bob D.; Wolterink, Jelmer M.; De Jong, Pim A.; Leiner, Tim; Viergever, Max A.; Isgum, Ivana",10.1109/TMI.2017.2673121,journalArticle,3IXCX3BP,2017,,1

Face Detection with Expression Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks,NO,,,,"This paper presents a Face Detection System with Expression Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks. It is an automated vision system designed and implemented using MATLAB. The Face Detection with Expression Recognition system accomplishes facial expression recognition through two phases. The captured image is processed first to detect the face, and then the facial expression is recognized. These two phases are completed in five stages. The first two stages of the system deal with detecting and cropping the face using image processing, in particular the Viola-Jones object detection framework. The third stage deals with converting the colors of the cropped image from RGB into gray scale and applying the appropriate smoothing filter. The fourth stage consists of feature extraction using Artificial Neural Networks, so as the extracted features are compared with training samples. The final stage classifies the given outputs and shows facial expression recognition results. It then determines whether the subject is happy, angry or in neutral state. The Artificial Neural Network uses Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) with back propagation algorithm for features extraction and classification. It has 4097 input nodes, one hidden layer with 50 neurons, and one output layer. Testing results show that this system can be used for interpreting three facial expressions: happiness, anger and neutral.

Novel quantitative indicators of digital ophthalmoscopy image quality,NO,,,,"With the advent of smartphone indirect ophthalmoscopy, teleophthalmology  the use of specialist ophthalmology assets at a distance from the patient  has experienced a breakthrough, promising enormous benefits especially for healthcare in distant, inaccessible or opthalmologically underserved areas, where specialists are either unavailable or too few in number. However, accurate teleophthalmology requires high-quality ophthalmoscopic imagery. This paper considers three feature families  statistical metrics, gradient-based metrics and wavelet transform coefficient derived indicators  as possible metrics to identify unsharp or blurry images. By using standard machine learning techniques, the suitability of these features for image quality assessment is confirmed, albeit on a rather small data set. With the increased availability and decreasing cost of digital ophthalmoscopy on one hand and the increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy worldwide on the other, creating tools that can determine whether an image is likely to be diagnostically suitable can play a significant role in accelerating and streamlining the teleophthalmology process. This paper highlights the need for more research in this area, including the compilation of a diverse database of ophthalmoscopic imagery, annotated with quality markers, to train the Point of Acquisition error detection algorithms of the future.MSC Codes 68T45 Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Image Crack Detection with Fully Convolutional Network Based on Deep Learning,NO,,,,"In order to effectively detect crack and reduce the error mark under complex background, a FCN fully convolutional network is introduced into the image crack detection in this paper. A crack FCN model based on FCN model is proposed to address the problems that lose local information and the capacity of partial refinement, which are frequently encountered in FCN model in the crack detection experiment. Firstly, with increasing resolution, the Dropout method of the full connection layer is cancelled, such that the increased selection of the crack information is fulfilled. Secondly, the whole network is carried out in a progressive manner by deepening the network depth of the FCN network. Finally, deconvolution layer in higher scale is added to extend the local fine detail based on the constructed network. According to the comparison experiment results, FCN-8s model and other detect methods in the 2 156 self-made crack image datasets illustrate that the accuracy of detection can be improved, whilst the error label can be reduced by using the Crack FCN network model.  2018, Beijing China Science Journal Publishing Co.

Text Detection and Recognition from Scene Images using MSER and CNN,NO,,,,Detection and recognition of text from natural images is very important for extracting information from images but is an extensively challenging task. This paper proposes an approach for detection of text area from natural scene images using Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) and recognizing the text using a self-trained Neural Network. Some preprocessing is applied to the image then MSER and canny edge is used to locate the smaller areas that may more likely contain text. The text is individually isolated as single characters by simple algorithms on the binary image and then passed through the recognition model specially designed for hazy and unaligned characters.  2018 IEEE.,"Choudhary, Savita; Singh, Nikhil Kumar; Chichadwani, Sanjay",10.1109/ICAECC.2018.8479419,conferencePaper,VNR2PLBY,2018,,1

To avoid problems such as line error detection or breakage, an improved line segment detector algorithm based on line segment detector was proposed.

Convolution neural network based automatic localization of landmarks on lateral x-ray images,NO,,,,"Cephalometric analysis is very essential for the patient having dentofacial and craniofacial deformities. The manual localization of the cephalometric landmarks is also important and critical for the observer that is required to be performed by the orthodontics only. The manual localization is the time consuming and the tedious task for the observer. Therefore, we proposes a method to automatically detect cephalometric landmarks on lateral cephalometric x-ray image. The proposed method is a deep learning approach where centroid based registration was performed on the same size images then ResNet50 was applied on the different patches which were made based on the geometrical position of the landmarks. Total ten patches were made for the 19 landmarks. The average landmark detection rate during the testing was achieved as 90.39% and 92.37% under 2-mm and 3-mm error respectively for testset1 database. The average landmark detection rate during the testing was achieved as 82.66% and 84.53% under 2-mm and 3-mm error respectively for testset2 database. The average mean error and standard deviation on testset1 was found as 1.23mm and 0.73 respectively and average mean error and standard deviation on testset2 was found as 1.37mm, and 0.88 respectively. The proposed method was compared with the state-of-the-art methods and found the improved results in terms of successful landmark detection rate under 2-mm.

RPN with the Attention-based Multi-Scale Method and the Adaptive Non-Maximum Suppression for Billboard Detection,NO,,,,"Billboard detection is a special application of general object detection. Although recent object detector algorithms based on deep learning have achieved well performance for general object detection, they have limited success for specific applications. In this paper, a novel method based on Faster R-CNN for billboard detection is proposed. The proposed architecture is called attention-based multi-scale feature fusion region proposal network (AM-RPN). The contribution of this paper is to propose the attention-based multi-scale feature fusion method for billboard detection. Since the billboards and background features from the lower convolution layers are similar, it is difficult to improve detection accuracy using the multi-scale methods which contain the low-level features. The proposed attention-based multi-scale feature fusion method uses attention mechanism to give different focus to the information which constitutes the multi-scale fusion feature. Attention mechanism ensures that the important information is left and the useless information is discarded. Moreover, this paper proposes the adaptive non-maximum suppression (ANMS) algorithm to replace the classical non-maximum suppression algorithm. The adaptive non-maximum suppression algorithm considers the relationship between the classes and allows more low confidence targets to be detected without increasing error detection. Our proposed approach is evaluated on Baidu's public billboard detection data set. Experimental results show that AM-RPN and the class suppression obtains significant improvements over the comparable state-of-the-art detection models for billboard detection.",Gang Liu; Chuyi Wang; Yanzhong Hu,10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780907,conferencePaper,Z8UH7CVS,2018,,1
Deep learning for evaluating difficult-to-detect incomplete repairs of high fluence laser optics at the national ignition facility,NO,,,,"Two machine-learning methods were evaluated to help automate the quality control process for mitigating damage sites on laser optics. The mitigation is a cone-like structure etched into locations on large optics that have been chipped by the high fluence (energy per unit area) laser light. Sometimes the repair leaves a difficult to detect remnant of the damage that needs to be addressed before the optic can be placed back on the beam line. We would like to be able to automatically detect these remnants. We try Deep Learning (convolutional neural networks using features autogenerated from large stores of labeled data, like ImageNet) and find it outperforms ensembles of decision trees (using custom-built features) in finding these subtle, rare, incomplete repairs of damage. We also implemented an unsupervised method for helping operators visualize where the network has spotted problems. This is done by projecting the credit for the result backwards onto the input image. This shows regions in an image most responsible for the networks decision. This can also be used to help understand the black box decisions the network is making and potentially improve the training process.  2017 SPIE.","Mundhenk, T.

Convolutional neural network guided blue crab knuckle detection for autonomous crab meat picking machine,NO,,,,"The Atlantic blue crab is among the highest-valued seafood found in the American Eastern Seaboard. Currently, the crab processing industry is highly dependent on manual labor. However, there is great potential for vision-guided intelligent machines to automate the meat picking process. Studies show that the back-fin knuckles are robust features containing information about a crab's size, orientation, and the position of the crab's meat compartments. Our studies also make it clear that detecting the knuckles reliably in images is challenging due to the knuckle's small size, anomalous shape, and similarity to joints in the legs and claws. An accurate and reliable computer vision algorithm was proposed to detect the crab's back-fin knuckles in digital images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can localize rough knuckle positions with 97.67% accuracy, transforming a global detection problem into a local detection problem. Compared to the rough localization based on human experience or other machine learning classification methods, the CNN shows the best localization results. In the rough knuckle position, a k-means clustering method is able to further extract the exact knuckle positions based on the back-fin knuckle color features. The exact knuckle position can help us to generate a crab cutline in XY plane using a template matching method.

Vision-based safety vest detection in a construction scene,NO,,,,"The computer vision-based detection of construction workers in images or videos is necessary for the safety managements and productivity of construction workers. Researchers in previous studies, detecting construction workers in the construction scene via computer vision techniques, have considered various features such as motion, shape, and color. Due to the pose changes of the workers, construction worker detection using body shape as a feature in the construction scene remains a challenging task. This study proposes a safety vest detection method, as a preceding method of the construction worker detection, which uses the motion of workers and the color pixels of safety vests for distinguishing from others in the construction scene independent of the workers' pose changes. The background subtraction method is performed by using an approximate median filter for the purpose of reducing the candidate regions that the color pixel classification will be performed as a sequential step. Then, the color pixel classification method is performed with a comparative analysis of two color spaces (Lab and HSV [hue, saturation, and value]) and three types of classifiers (a support vector machine [SVM], an artificial neural network [ANN], and a logistic regression [LR]) to classify the pixels of safety vests accurately. The proposed method has been tested on the actual construction site video streams. The proposed method of this study, thus far, is making progress toward the achievement of the robust and effective construction worker detection in the construction scene.","Seong, H.; Choi, H.; Cho, H.; Lee, S.; Son, H.; Kim, C.",10.22260/isarc2017/0039,conferencePaper,Y6PR2LYB,2017,,1
Small target modified car parts detection based on improved Faster-RCNN,NO,,,,"Because the small target image has fewer pixels, it is prone to miss detection and error detection; the target detection algorithm needs to be improved and enhanced to deal with the problem about the small target detection in specific scenarios.

The commonest modification is to install a rear wing and change the contact angle between the hub and the ground. This paper proposes a method to detect modified car parts based on improving Faster-Rcnn, in order to detect two modifications described above. On the basis of the original Faster-Rcnn, using multi-scale training and increasing the number of Anchors to enhance the robustness of the network in detecting targets of different sizes, and introducing the Soft-NMS algorithm to replace the NMS algorithm, to solve the problem of partial overlap between two targets when the distance is close, the possibility of missed detection of targets with low confidence and bounding boxes with high confidence scores are not always more reliable than bounding boxes with low confidence.

Underwater Fish Detection with Weak Multi-Domain Supervision,NO,,,,"Given a sufficiently large training dataset, it is relatively easy to train a modern convolution neural network (CNN) as a required image classifier. However, for the task of fish classification and/or fish detection, if a CNN was trained to detect or classify particular fish species in particular background habitats, the same CNN exhibits much lower accuracy when applied to new/unseen fish species and/or fish habitats. Therefore, in practice, the CNN needs to be continuously fine-tuned to improve its classification accuracy to handle new project-specific fish species or habitats. In this work we present a labelling-efficient method of training a CNN-based fish-detector (the Xception CNN was used as the base) on relatively small numbers (4,000) of project-domain underwater fish/no-fish images from 20 different habitats. Additionally, 17,000 of known negative (that is, missing fish) general-domain (VOC2012) above-water images were used. Two publicly available fish-domain datasets supplied additional 27,000 of above-water and underwater positive/fish images. By using this multi-domain collection of images, the trained Xception-based binary (fish/not-fish) classifier achieved 0.17% false-positives and 0.61% false-negatives on the project's 20,000 negative and 16,000 positive holdout test images, respectively.

Det2Seg: A Two-Stage Approach for Road Object Segmentation from 3D Point Clouds,NO,,,,"Object segmentation from 3D point clouds is an important topic in real-world applications. However, due to the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds, instance segmentation often suffers unsatisfying performance in various scenes such as autonomous driving. There are two main difficulties. First, in a wild scene, background noise often occupies a majority of the entire point set. Second, small-scale objects are often difficult to be recognized due to larger uncertainty. In this paper, we propose Det2Seg, a two-stage approach which alleviates the above issues towards more accurate instance segmentation of road-objects. In the first stage, we adopt Pointpillars [1] to detect the regions-of-interest that can localize and classify objects in a coarse level; in the second stage, we extract points from the detected regions into pillars, encode them into a new data format and feed it into a 2D convolutional neural network to perform fine-grained, domain-specific instance segmentation. We evaluate our approach on raw LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data from the KITTI dataset [2]. The experimental results show that our approach largely outperforms the prior researches. In particular, our approach stands out for its significant ability on recognizing and segmenting small-scale objects, i.e., an improvement of over 20% in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU), beyond state-of-the-Arts, is obtained for the cyclist class.  2019 IEEE.","Zuo, Chen; Zhang, Wei; Xie, Lingxi; Tian, Qi; Xiong, Hongkai",10.1109/VCIP47243.2019.8965792,conferencePaper,8XNGFBAR,2019,,1
Deep learning-based industry product defect detection with low false negative error tolerance,NO,,,,"Many methods for product defect detection have been proposed in the literature. The methods can be roughly divided into two categories, namely conventional statistical methods and machine learning-based ones. Especially for image-based defect detection, deep learning is known as the state-of-the-art. For product defect detection, the main issue is to reduce the false negative error rate (FNER) to almost zero, while keeping a relatively low false positive error rate (FPER). We can reduce the errors by introducing a rejection mechanism, but this approach may reject too many products for manual re-checking. In this study, we found that extremely low FNER can be achieved if we combine several techniques in using deep learning.

MalJPEG: Machine Learning Based Solution for the Detection of Malicious JPEG Images,related,,,,"In recent years, cyber-attacks against individuals, businesses, and organizations have increased. Cyber criminals are always looking for effective vectors to deliver malware to victims in order to launch an attack. Images are used on a daily basis by millions of people around the world, and most users consider images to be safe for use; however, some types of images can contain a malicious payload and perform harmful actions. JPEG is the most popular image format, primarily due to its lossy compression. It is used by almost everyone, from individuals to large organizations, and can be found on almost every device (on digital cameras and smartphones, websites, social media, etc.). Because of their harmless reputation, massive use, and high potential for misuse, JPEG images are used by cyber criminals as an attack vector. While machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting known and unknown malware in various domains, to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods have not been used particularly for the detection of malicious JPEG images. In this paper, we present MalJPEG, the first machine learning-based solution tailored specifically at the efficient detection of unknown malicious JPEG images. MalJPEG statically extracts 10 simple yet discriminative features from the JPEG file structure and leverages them with a machine learning classifier, in order to discriminate between benign and malicious JPEG images. We evaluated MalJPEG extensively on a real-world representative collection of 156,818 images which contains 155,013 (98.85%) benign and 1,805 (1.15%) malicious images.

Visual relationship detection based on bidirectional recurrent neural network,NO,,,,"Visual relationship detection is a task aiming at mining the information of interactions between the paired objects in the image, describing the image in the form of (subject  predicate  object). Most of the previous works regard it as a pure classification problem by taking the integrated triplets as the label of the image; however, the numerous combinations of objects and the diversity of predicates are the tough challenges for these studies. Hence, we propose a deep model based on a modified bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) to classify object and predict predicate simultaneously.

Deep Learning-based Pavement Cracks Detection via Wireless Visible Light Camera-based Network,NO,,,,"Road maintenance is important to ensure the normal usage of road transportation. Due to complicated effects including natural consumptions and human overuses, various forms of damages appear on the road surface, and among them, pavement cracks are the most representative ones. Therefore, the automatic detection of pavement cracks is important and essential in road maintenance. In this study, deep learning techniques are incorporated to fulfill the automatic pavement cracks detection based on a wireless visible light camera-based network. Technically, a visible light high-definition camera is equipped at the bottom of a maintenance vehicle, and pavement images are automatically captured along with the movement of the vehicle. Then, images are wirelessly transferred to a workstation on the maintenance vehicle, and the pavement cracks detection task is fulfilled via deep learning techniques from the classification perspective. Experimental results demonstrate that, the above wireless visible light camera-based system is capable to discern pavement cracks accurately. Also, real-time performance is guaranteed within this deep learning-based pavement cracks detection study.  2019 IEEE.","Zou, Yuxin; Cao, Wen; Luo, Mingyuan; Zhang, Peng; Wang, Wei; Huang, Wei",10.1109/ComComAp46287.2019.9018814,conferencePaper,KVH7GQ4F,2019,,1

Simultaneous Lung Field Detection and Segmentation for Pediatric Chest Radiographs,NO,,,,"Accurate lung field segmentation (LFS) method is highly demanded in computer-aid diagnosis (CAD) system. However, LFS in pediatric CXR images has received few attention due to the lack of publicly available dataset and the challenges caused by their unique characteristics, such as great variations of the size, location and orientation of lungs. To fill this gap, this paper for the first time presents a simultaneous lung field detection and segmentation framework for pediatric CXR images. Our framework, called SDSLung Net, is a multi-tasking convolutional neural network architecture tailor-made for X-ray images with relatively weak appearance feature but abundant spatial rules and structural information. It is adapted from a Mask R-CNN framework [1] by incorporating a newly designed Organ Structure-Aware Encoding layer in the backbone network for more accurate spatial variation and structural representation, in parallel with a deeply supervised fully convolutional network based segmentation branch for precise lung field segmentation inside detected bounding box. Moreover, we also constructed a new and so far the largest pediatric CXR dataset with pixelwise lung field annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SDSLung is capable of achieving significantly superior performance over state-of-the-art LFS methods on our large-scale pediatric CXR dataset and also achieving extremely competitive results on adults CXR dataset.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Zhang, Wei; Li, Guanbin; Wang, Fuyu; E, Longjiang; Yu, Yizhou; Lin, Liang; Liang, Huiying",10.1007/978-3-030-32226-7_66,conferencePaper,HKH62S6F,2019,,1

Towards real-time building damage mapping with low-cost UAV solutions,NO,,,,"The timely and efficient generation of detailed damage maps is of fundamental importance following disaster events to speed up first responders' (FR) rescue activities and help trapped victims. Several works dealing with the automated detection of building damages have been published in the last decade. The increasingly widespread availability of inexpensive UAV platforms has also driven their recent adoption for rescue operations (i.e., search and rescue). Their deployment, however, remains largely limited to visual image inspection by skilled operators, limiting their applicability in time-constrained real conditions. This paper proposes a new solution to autonomously map building damages with a commercial UAV in near real-time. The solution integrates different components that allow the live streaming of the images on a laptop and their processing on the fly. Advanced photogrammetric techniques and deep learning algorithms are combined to deliver a true-orthophoto showing the position of building damages, which are already processed by the time the UAV returns to base. These algorithms have been customized to deliver fast results, fulfilling the near real-time requirements. The complete solution has been tested in different conditions, and received positive feedback by the FR involved in the EU funded project INACHUS. Two realistic pilot tests are described in the paper. The achieved results show the great potential of the presented approach, how close the proposed solution is to FR' expectations, and where more work is still needed.  2019 by the authors.","Nex, Francesco; Duarte, Diogo; Steenbeek, Anne; Kerle, Norman",10.3390/rs11030287,journalArticle,4V2YB8XH,2019,,1

Learning graph affinities for spectral graph-based salient object detection,NO,,,,"In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning graph affinities for salient object detection. First, we assume that a graph representation of an image is given with a predetermined connectivity rule and representative features for each of its nodes. Then, we learn to predict affinities related to this graph, that ensures a decent salient object detection performance, when used with a spectral graph based foreground detection method. To accomplish this task, we modify convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) for graph affinity calculation, which were originally proposed to predict similarities between images. Subsequently, we employ a spectral graph based salient object detection method  Extended Quantum Cuts (EQCut)  using these graph affinities. We show that the salient object detection error of such a system is differentiable with respect to the parameters of the CKN. Therefore, the proposed system can be trained end-to-end by applying error backpropagation and CKN parameters can be learned for salient object detection task. The comparative evaluations over a large set of benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method has an insignificant computational burden on, but significantly outperforms the baseline EQCut  which uses color affinities  and achieves a comparable performance level with the state-of-the-art in some performance measures.  2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aytekin, Calar; Iosifidis, Alexandros; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Gabbouj, Moncef",10.1016/j.patcog.2016.11.005,journalArticle,NRC2CVX6,2017,,1

Estimation of detection/classification performance in sonar imagery using textural features and self-organising maps,NO,,,,"Accurate estimation of detection/classification performance for sidescan sonar systems in Mine Counter-Measure (MCM) applications is important for informing mission tactics and adapting autonomous behaviors. The approach presented in this paper assumes that detection/classification performance can be estimated solely from historical data collected from similar surveys. This paper introduces an algorithm for comparing the textural difference of two surveys, and calculating a performance estimate from the most similar surveys in a database. The approach characterizes surveys using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of textural features. A histogram is generated for each mission by assigning textures to their Best Matching Unit (BMU) in the SOM. Mission difference is calculated as the chi-squared distance between two histograms. Using this difference measure, it is shown that the estimate of detector recall over the most textually similar surveys improves on the estimate over all surveys by a factor of 5. The estimate of precision is improved by a factor of 2.

Detection of a human head on a low-quality image and its software implementation,NO,,,,"The paper considers the task solution of detection on two-dimensional images not only face, but head of a human regardless of the turn to the observer. Such task is also complicated by the fact that the image receiving at the input of the recognition algorithm may be noisy or captured in low light conditions. The minimum size of a persons head in an image to be detected for is 1010 pixels. In the course of development, a dataset was prepared containing over 1000 labelled images of classrooms at BSTU n.a.

Deep convolutional encoder-decoders for prostate cancer detection and classification,NO,,,,"Prostate cancer accounts for approximately 11% of all cancer cases. Definitive diagnosis is made by histopathological examination of tissue biopsies. Recently, there have been strong correlations established between pre-biopsy multi-parametric MR image findings and the histopathology results. We investigate novel deep learning networks that provide tumor localization and classification solely based on prostate multi-parametric MR images using images with biopsy confirmed lesions. We propose to use a multi-channel image-to-image convolutional encoder-decoders where responses signify localized lesions and output channels represent different tumor classes. We take simple point locations in the labeled ground truth data and train networks to output Gaussian kernels around those points across multiple channels. This approach allows for both localization and classification within a single run. The input data consists of axial T2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, high b-value diffusion-weighted images, and K-trans parameter maps from 202 patients. The images were co-registered on a per patient basis and exhaustive comparisons were performed with 5-fold cross-validation across three different models with increasing complexity. The highest average classification area-under-the-curve (AUC) achieved was 83.4% using a medium complexity model, in which no skip-connection were used across layers. In individual k-folds, AUCs above 90% were achieved. The results demonstrate promise for directly determining tumor malignancy without performing an invasive biopsy procedure.

Machine learning by textural features in the task of detecting neurons on brain slices stained by Nissl,NO,,,,"The problem of detecting and classifying neurons on mouse brain sections stained by Nissl in optical microscopy is considered. The application in this problem of machine learning algorithms in combination with the use of textural features of the object is investigated. The proposed method includes two main steps: the classification of pixels and the detection of neuron centers. At the stage of classification using the k nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm determines the belonging of each pixel to the neuron's body. In the paper, 3 types of textural features were constructed, based on: a normalized histogram; structural tensor; their combination. To find the centers of neurons, all the pixels belonging to the neurons are clustered using the mean shift algorithm. The experiments showed that the best detection quality was achieved using combined textural features (histogram + structural tensor) with a radius of neighborhood R = 7 with the following quality indicators: recall = 0.77; precision = 0.79; F1 score = 0.78. On the data set under consideration, the choice of the parameter k> 15 does not significantly improve the detection quality.

Analysis of the eccentricity detection error in iris recognition,NO,,,,"An iris biometric system has a versatile applicability. At this point, there is a wide number of areas where iris biometrics is successfully implemented as a means of access, areas such as finance, banking, healthcare, welfare, border control, point of sale and ATMs. The performance of an iris biometric system can be sensible to any error that may perpetuate, starting even from the eye image acquisition. It is obvious that an iris biometric system that functions with errors would eventually lead to behaving in an undesired manner: consistently rejecting its users and/or authorizing persons from outside the system. This article has the purpose of identifying the influence of one particular error: the Eccentricity Detection Error (E.D.E.), a newly identified type of iris segmentation error. Having a non-zero E.D.E. means having, for two iris images that are acquired from the same person, a different distance between the two vectors determined by the pupillary (inner) boundary centers and the limbic (outer) boundary centers. This distance is established on the basis of the approximated (during segmentation) inner and outer boundary centers for the two irides.

Methods: A total of 69 CTA scans (39 for training and 30 for validation) with different pathology types were selected to train the network. Furthermore, a total of 71 CTA scans were selected independently and applied as the test set to assess their performance. Results: The accuracy was evaluated by comparing the locations marked by the method with benchmark locations (which were manually marked by two experts). The interobserver error was 4.6  2.3 mm. On an average, the differences between the locations marked by the two experts and those detected by the computer were 6.6  3.0 mm and 6.8  3.3 mm, respectively, when calculated using the test set.

Convolution neural network based automatic corn kernel qualification,NO,,,,"Corn qualification is an important and time-consuming task in biosystem area. The human-based inspection strategy needs to be updated gradually with the quick development of corn industry. In this paper, an automatic corn qualification machine is proposed. Compared to related research, our machine integrates several new designs in both hardware and software components. Firstly, a gravity-based dual-side cameras design expands the machine`s field of view to describe corn kernels more completely. Second, touching kernels are preprocessed by a new K-means clustering guided curvature method, which can improve the robustness of our machine. Most importantly, deep convolutional neural network, a novel image processing technique, is embedded into the system to evaluate corn kernels. Compared to some traditional image classifiers, deep convolutional neural network can mimic human ideas, and make decisions based on overall considerations about image features. In our test dataset, deep convolutional neural network can achieve 97.0% test accuracy, and outperforms than current researches. Our corn qualification machine promises a great commercial value in the market, and it is also a good and practical application of artificial intelligent in real world.  2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

Detection and Pose Estimation for Short-Range Vision-Based Underwater Docking,NO,,,,"The potential of using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for underwater exploration is confined by its limited on-board battery energy and data storage capacity. This problem has been addressed using docking systems by underwater recharging and data transfer for AUVs. In this paper, we propose a vision-based framework by addressing the detection and pose estimation problems for short-range underwater docking using these systems. For robust and credible detection of docking stations, we propose a convolutional neural network called docking neural network (DoNN). For accurate pose estimation, a perspective-n-point algorithm is integrated into our framework. In order to examine our framework in underwater docking tasks, we collected a dataset of 2D images, named underwater docking images dataset (UDID), which is the first publicly available underwater docking dataset to the best of our knowledge. In the field experiments, we first evaluate the performance of DoNN on the UDID and its deformed variations. Next, we examine the pose estimation module by ground and underwater experiments. At last, we integrate our proposed vision-based framework with an ultra-short baseline acoustic sensor, to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our framework by performing experiments in a lake. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is able to detect docking stations and estimate their relative pose more efficiently and successfully, compared with the state-of-the-art baseline systems.  2013 IEEE.","Liu, Shuang; Ozay, Mete; Okatani, Takayuki; Xu, Hongli; Sun, Kai; Lin, Yang",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885537,journalArticle,XU4EXAFM,2019,,1

The neural networks are trained to recognize targets in a specified environment subject to the proposed conditions ascribed by a traditional CFAR detector. We show that after an initial learning process, a trained neural network can offer improved detectional performance.

Novel quantitative indicators of digital ophthalmoscopy image quality [arXiv],NO,,,,"With the advent of smartphone indirect ophthalmoscopy, teleophthalmology - the use of specialist ophthalmology assets at a distance from the patient - has experienced a breakthrough, promising enormous benefits especially for healthcare in distant, inaccessible or opthalmologically underserved areas, where specialists are either unavailable or too few in number. However, accurate teleophthalmology requires high-quality ophthalmoscopic imagery. This paper considers three feature families - statistical metrics, gradient-based metrics and wavelet transform coefficient derived indicators - as possible metrics to identify unsharp or blurry images. By using standard machine learning techniques, the suitability of these features for image quality assessment is confirmed, albeit on a rather small data set. With the increased availability and decreasing cost of digital ophthalmoscopy on one hand and the increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy worldwide on the other, creating tools that can determine whether an image is likely to be diagnostically suitable can play a significant role in accelerating and streamlining the teleophthalmology process. This paper highlights the need for more research in this area, including the compilation of a diverse database of ophthalmoscopic imagery, annotated with quality markers, to train the Point of Acquisition error detection algorithms of the future.","von Csefalvay, C.",,journalArticle,927GGPZJ,2019,,1
Detecting Adversarial Image Examples in Deep Neural Networks with Adaptive Noise Reduction,related,,,,"Recently, many studies have demonstrated deep neural network (DNN) classifiers can be fooled by the adversarial example, which is crafted via introducing some perturbations into an original sample. Accordingly, some powerful defense techniques were proposed. However, existing defense techniques often require modifying the target model or depend on the prior knowledge of attacks. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method for detecting adversarial image examples, which can be directly deployed into unmodified off-the-shelf DNN models. We consider the perturbation to images as a kind of noise and introduce two classic image processing techniques, scalar quantization and smoothing spatial filter, to reduce its effect. The image entropy is employed as a metric to implement an adaptive noise reduction for different kinds of images. Consequently, the adversarial example can be effectively detected by comparing the classification results of a given sample and its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks. More than 20,000 adversarial examples against some state-of-the-art DNN models are used to evaluate the proposed method, which are crafted with different attack techniques. The experiments show that our detection method can achieve a high overall F1 score of 96.39 percent and certainly raises the bar for defense-aware attacks.  2020 IEEE.","Liang, Bin; Li, Hongcheng; Su, Miaoqiang; Li, Xirong; Shi, Wenchang; Wang, Xiaofeng",10.1109/TDSC.2018.2874243,journalArticle,SZN9D7AK,2021,aug,1
Detection of flaws in concrete using ultrasonic tomography and convolutional neural networks,NO,,,,"Non-destructive testing of concrete for defects detection, using acoustic techniques, is currently performed mainly by human inspection of recorded images. The images consist of the inside of the examined elements obtained from testing devices such as the ultrasonic tomograph. However, such an automatic inspection is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. To address some of these problems, this paper aims to evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) toward an automated detection of flaws in concrete elements using ultrasonic tomography. There are two main stages in the proposed methodology. In the first stage, an image of the inside of the examined structure is obtained and recorded by performing ultrasonic tomography-based testing. In the second stage, a convolutional neural network model is used for automatic detection of defects and flaws in the recorded image. In this work, a large and pre-trained CNN is used. It was fine-tuned on a small set of images collected during laboratory tests. Lastly, the prepared model was applied for detecting flaws. The obtained model has proven to be able to accurately detect defects in examined concrete elements. The presented approach for automatic detection of flaws is being developed with the potential to not only detect defects of one type but also to classify various types of defects in concrete elements.  2020 by the authors.","Sloski, Marek; Schabowicz, Krzysztof; Krawczyk, Ewa",10.3390/ma13071557,journalArticle,67HRC7VQ,2020,,1

"Brazilian Traffic Signs Detection and Recognition in Videos Using CLAHE, HOG Feature Extraction and SVM Cascade Classifier with Temporal Coherence",NO,,,,"Worldwide, traffic safety is a strong concern as traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of death. In this context, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles are traffic management measures aimed at improving road safety and flow. Automatic detection and recognition of traffic signs are important for intelligent vehicles and ADAS systems. This work proposes a pipeline of digital image processing (DIP) techniques, machine learning (ML), and temporal coherence to perform the detection and recognition of Brazilian traffic signs in videos aiming an application for real-time systems to help in traffic safety and to reduce the number of fatal accidents. We are mainly interested in recognizing signs of speed limit group, no overtaking and obligatory passage, thus our detection considers the traffic sign with a circular shape and red border. For detection, the red color segmentation and the Hough transform are used to find circular regions that will be classified through the SVM algorithm in sign and not sign. For recognition of these signs, the support vector machines (SVM) are used. For speed limit signs the thresholding and contours are used to segment the digits for later classification.

Construction and Utilization of a Neural Network Model to Predict Current Procedural Terminology Codes from Pathology Report Texts,NO,,,,"Background: At our department, each specimen was assigned a tentative current procedural terminology (CPT) code at accessioning. The codes were subject to subsequent changes by pathologist assistants and pathologists. After the cases had been finalized, their CPT codes went through a final verification step by coding staff, with the aid of a keyword-based CPT code-checking web application. Greater than 97% of the initial assignments were correct. This article describes the construction of a CPT code-predicting neural network model and its incorporation into the CPT code-checking application. Materials and Methods: R programming language was used. Pathology report texts and CPT codes for the cases finalized during January 1-November 30, 2018, were retrieved from the database. The order of the specimens was randomized before the data were partitioned into training and validation set. R Keras package was used for both model training and prediction. The chosen neural network had a three-layer architecture consisting of a word-embedding layer, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, and a densely connected layer. It used concatenated header-diagnosis texts as the input. Results: The model predicted CPT codes in both the validation data set and the test data set with an accuracy of 97.5% and 97.6%, respectively. Closer examination of the test data set (cases from December 1 to 27, 2018) revealed two interesting observations. First, among the specimens that had incorrect initial CPT code assignments, the model disagreed with the initial assignments in 73.6% (117/159) and agreed in 26.4% (42/159). Second, the model identified nine additional specimens with incorrect CPT codes that had evaded all steps of checking. Conclusions: A neural network model using report texts to predict CPT codes can achieve high accuracy in prediction and moderate sensitivity in error detection. Neural networks may play increasing roles in CPT coding in surgical pathology.","Ye, Jay J.",10.4103/jpi.jpi_3_19,journalArticle,JZ2FPZYN,2019,,1

Deep Cascaded Networks for Sparsely Distributed Object Detection from Medical Images,NO,,,,"With the development of deep learning techniques, the performance of object detection has been significantly advanced. Although various methods have been designed to detect landmarks for computer-aided diagnosis, how to efficiently and effectively leverage deep learning approaches to detect sparsely distributed objects, such as mitosis and cerebral microbleeds, from large scale medical images hasn't been fully explored. In this chapter, we introduce a two-stage cascaded deep learning framework, referred as deep cascaded networks, to detect sparsely distributed objects that provide clinical significance with both high efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, the first screening stage with coarse retrieval model rapidly retrieves potential candidates, and subsequently the second discrimination stage with the fine discrimination model focuses on those candidates to further accurately single out the true targets from challenging mimics. Furthermore, we corroborate the importance of volumetric feature representations for volumetric imaging modalities by exploiting 3D convolutional neural networks.

Artificial Intelligence in Laser Powder Bed Fusion Procedures - Neural Networks for Live-Detection and Forecasting of Printing Failures,NO,,,,"Recently, many disruptive technologies like additive manufacturing were developed and have grown to production grade solutions. While such technologies can reduce the required time and amount of material, they require new methods to address long printing times and error identification in complex process structures. Such systems can be created using artificial intelligence (AI), such that operators can focus on supervising monitoring systems rather than the printing process and can decide upon preprocessed information. For the laser powder bed fusion process (LPBF), a main challenge lies in error detection per layer and in predicting the necessity of near-future operator interaction, to meet quality standards. Yet, only few works aim to automate the task of characterizing build layers. We propose an AI-driven approach to identify and forecast printing errors in LPBF using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Cox proportional hazards (CPH) approach. For training and validation, layer wise greyscale images of 27 print jobs have been recorded. All print jobs' results were qualitatively rated afterwards by experts. We then perform an autoencoder-based clustering and compare print jobs of high and low quality to create pseudo-labels. We finally train a CNN in a supervised fashion to classify layers as succeeded or faulty, as well as a CPH model to estimate remaining build time without errors. We achieve an overall accuracy of 94.9% for the CNN and statistically significant forecasts (p  0.005) of the imposed hazard per layer using the CPH model. Our work demonstrates a novel approach of automated build part characterization, that reduces human operator effort and can be used for automated quality assurance and process monitoring.  2022 The Authors.

Esophageal Abnormality Detection Using DenseNet Based Faster R-CNN with Gabor Features,NO,,,,"Early detection of esophageal abnormalities can help in preventing the progression of the disease into later stages. During esophagus examination, abnormalities are often overlooked due to the irregular shape, variable size, and the complex surrounding area which requires a significant effort and experience. In this paper, a novel deep learning model which is based on faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) is presented to automatically detect abnormalities in the esophagus from endoscopic images. The proposed detection system is based on a combination of Gabor handcrafted features with the CNN features. The densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNets) architecture is embraced to extract the CNN features providing a strengthened feature propagation between the layers and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. To address the challenges of detecting abnormal complex regions, we propose fusing extracted Gabor features with the CNN features through concatenation to enhance texture details in the detection stage. Our newly designed architecture is validated on two datasets (Kvasir and MICCAI 2015). Regarding the Kvasir, the results show an outstanding performance with a recall of 90.2% and a precision of 92.1% with a mean of average precision (mAP) of 75.9%. While for the MICCAI 2015 dataset, the model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art performance with 95% recall and 91% precision with mAP value of 84%.

Prediction Based Deep Autoencoding Model for Anomaly Detection,YES,,,,"Latent variables and reconstruction error generated from auto encoder are the common means for anomaly detection dealing with high dimensional signals. They are exclusively typical representations of the original input, and a plenty of methods utilizing them for anomaly detection have achieved good results. In this paper, we propose a new method combining these two features together to generate proper scores for anomaly detection. As both these two features contain useful information contributing to anomaly detection, good results can be expected by fusion of those two. The architecture proposed in this paper comprises of two networks, and we only use normal data for training. To compress and rebuild an input, a deep auto encoder (AE) is utilized where low dimensional latent variables and reconstruction error can be obtained, and compactness loss is introduced on latent variables to maintain a low intra-variance. Meanwhile, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network which takes the generated latent variables as input is established aiming at predicting its corresponding reconstruction error. By introducing MLP network, anomalies sharing similar reconstruction error yet different distribution of latent variables to normal data or vice versa can be separated. These two networks, AE and MLP are trained jointly in our model and the prediction error form MLP network is used as the final score for anomaly detection.

About the Application of Autoencoders for Visual Defect Detection,NO,,,,"Visual defect detection is a key technology in modern industrial manufacturing systems. There are many possible appearances of product defects, including distortions in color, shape, contamination, missing or superfluous parts. For the detection of those, besides traditional image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks based methods have also appeared to avoid the usage of hand-crafted features and to build more efficient detection mechanisms. In our article we deal with autoencoder convolutional networks (AEs) which do not require examples of defects for training. Unfortunately, the manual and/or trial-and-error design of AEs is still required to achieve good performance, since there are many unknown parameters of AEs which can greatly influence the detection abilities. For our study we have chosen a well performing AE known as structural similarity AE (SSIM-AE), where the loss function and the comparison of the output with the input is implemented via the SSIM instead of the often used L1 or L2 norms. Investigating the performance of SSIM-AE on different data-sets, we found that its performance can be improved with modified convolutional structures without modifying the size of latent space. We also show that finding a model with low reconstruction error during training does not mean good detection abilities and denoising AEs can increase efficiency.  2021 University of West Bohemia.

Detection of vehicle parts based on Faster R-CNN and relative position information,NO,,,,"Detection and recognition of vehicles are two essential tasks in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Currently, a prevalent method is to detect vehicle body, logo or license plate at first, and then recognize them. So the detection task is the most basic, but also the most important work. Besides the logo and license plate, some other parts, such as vehicle face, lamp, windshield and rearview mirror, are also key parts which can reflect the characteristics of vehicle and be used to improve the accuracy of recognition task. In this paper, the detection of vehicle parts is studied, and the work is novel. We choose Faster R-CNN as the basic algorithm, and take the local area of an image where vehicle body locates as input, then can get multiple bounding boxes with their own scores. If the box with maximum score is chosen as final result directly, it is often not the best one, especially for small objects. This paper presents a method which corrects original score with relative position information between two parts. Then we choose the box with maximum comprehensive score as the final result. Compared with original output strategy, the proposed method performs better.  2018 SPIE.","Zhang, Mingwen; Sang, Nong; Chen, Youbin; Gao, Changxin; Wang, Yongzhong",10.1117/12.2287087,conferencePaper,IVKCQSWW,2017,,1
Comparison of deep learning and human observer performance for lesion detection and characterization,NO,,,,"The detection and characterizations of abnormalities in clinical imaging is of the utmost importance for patient diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we present a comparison of convolutional neural network (CNN) and human observer performance on a simulated lesion detection and characterization task. We apply both conventional performance metrics including accuracy and non-conventional metrics such as lift charts to perform qualitative and quantitative comparison of each type of observer. It is determined that the CNN generally outperforms the human observers, particularly at high noise levels. However, high noise correlation reduces the relative performance of the CNN, and human observer performance is comparable to CNN under these conditions. These findings extend into the field of diagnostic radiology, where the adoption of deep learning is starting to become widespread. The importance of considering the applications for which deep learning is most effective is of critical importance to this development.  COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Dual networks based 3D Multi-Person Pose Estimation from Monocular Video,NO,,,,"Monocular 3D human pose estimation has made progress in recent years. Most of the methods focus on single persons, which estimate the poses in the person-centric coordinates, i.e., the coordinates based on the center of the target person. Hence, these methods are inapplicable for multi-person 3D pose estimation, where the absolute coordinates (e.g., the camera coordinates) are required. Moreover, multi-person pose estimation is more challenging than single pose estimation, due to inter-person occlusion and close human interactions. Existing top-down multi-person methods rely on human detection (i.e., top-down approach), and thus suffer from the detection errors and cannot produce reliable pose estimation in multi-person scenes. Meanwhile, existing bottom-up methods that do not use human detection are not affected by detection errors, but since they process all persons in a scene at once, they are prone to errors, particularly for persons in small scales. To address all these challenges, we propose the integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to exploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection based normalized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for final 3D poses. To address the common gaps between training and testing data, we do optimization during the test time, by refining the estimated 3D human poses using high-order temporal constraint, re-projection loss, and bone length regularizations. We also introduce a two-person pose discriminator that enforces natural two-person interactions. Finally, we apply a semi-supervised method to overcome the 3D ground-truth data scarcity. Our evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its individual components.

Research of UAV target detection and flight control based on deep learning,NO,,,,"Deep learning has attracted widespread attention and has achieved good recognition results in image recognition and detection. Based on the Faster R-CNN algorithm, this paper studies the application of deep learning in drones and verifies its effect on target detection. In the most of existing schemes, the drone compresses the image and transmits it to the ground station for further detection, and then the resulting control command is transmitted back to the drone. This requires high bandwidth and high transmission delay, which limits the response speed of the system. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the system will use the embedded system mounted on the UAV for image processing and pattern recognition, which saves transmission bandwidth and shortens response time. Through the Faster R-CNN target recognition algorithm, the UAV's target detection and flight control based on deep learning is finally realized.

Remarkably, the network is able to detect the person even in the case the imaging system we propose cannot reject the flame disturbance in full, thus improving its robustness.

Automatic Detection and Recognition of Individuals in Patterned Species,NO,,,,"Visual animal biometrics is rapidly gaining popularity as it enables a non-invasive and cost-effective approach for wildlife monitoring applications. Widespread usage of camera traps has led to large volumes of collected images, making manual processing of visual content hard to manage. In this work, we develop a framework for automatic detection and recognition of individuals in different patterned species like tigers, zebras and jaguars. Most existing systems primarily rely on manual input for localizing the animal, which does not scale well to large datasets. In order to automate the detection process while retaining robustness to blur, partial occlusion, illumination and pose variations, we use the recently proposed Faster-RCNN object detection framework to efficiently detect animals in images. We further extract features from AlexNet of the animals flank and train a logistic regression (or Linear SVM) classifier to recognize the individuals. We primarily test and evaluate our framework on a camera trap tiger image dataset that contains images that vary in overall image quality, animal pose, scale and lighting. We also evaluate our recognition system on zebra and jaguar images to show generalization to other patterned species. Our framework gives perfect detection results in camera trapped tiger images and a similar or better individual recognition performance when compared with state-of-the-art recognition techniques.  2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Cheema, Gullal Singh; Anand, Saket",10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_3,conferencePaper,DE3XVNRW,2017,,1

Track Cyclist Detection and Identification using Mask R-CNN and K-means Clustering,NO,,,,"Automatically identifying a cyclist as they pass the starting line in a track cycling race is primarily restricted to physical detection systems assigned to individual competitors. These current solutions are expensive and require physical hardware to be attached to the cyclists during a race. This paper proposes a method to both detect when a track cyclist passes the lap line and identify the cyclist using a region convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and K-means clustering. This method aims to overcome several limitations of prior research by identifying multiple cyclists in a single frame, requiring only a single image to train per cyclist, and increasing identification accuracy by combining a neural network with K-means clustering. The proposed method uses the Mask R-CNN with COCO 2017 dataset and K-means clustering to train the detector with a single image of each cyclist. Cyclists are then able to be identified during a race. The method achieved an average identification accuracy of 95.1% with single image training. Multiple cyclists could be detected in an individual frame through the successful integration of a combined Mask R-CNN K-means detector. The primary limitation of the method is the reduction in identification accuracy for cyclists wearing similar coloured clothing. By using K-means clustering and RGB range thresholding, the cyclists may be mis-identified if the colours are too similar. Further research that would benefit this solution includes developing additional points-of-interest to identify cyclists and additional cameras with different angles for instances of total overlap between cyclists.  2019 IEEE.","Tyler-Rodrigue, Marco; Green, Richard",10.1109/IVCNZ48456.2019.8961035,conferencePaper,UXXJ6NCS,2019,,1
Error-robust distributed denial of service attack detection based on an average common feature extraction technique,NO,,,,"In recent years, advanced threats against CyberPhysical Systems (CPSs), such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, are increasing. Furthermore, traditional machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) often fail to efficiently detect such attacks when corrupted datasets are used for IDS training. To face these challenges, this paper proposes a novel error-robust multidimensional technique for DDoS attack detection. By applying the well-known Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), initially, the average value of the common features among instances is filtered out from the dataset. Next, the filtered data are forwarded to machine learning classification algorithms in which traffic information is classified as a legitimate or a DDoS attack. In terms of results, the proposed scheme outperforms traditional low-rank approximation techniques, presenting an accuracy of 98.94%, detection rate of 97.70% and false alarm rate of 4.35% for a dataset corruption level of 30% with a random forest algorithm applied for classification. In addition, for error-free conditions, it is found that the proposed approach outperforms other related works, showing accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate of 99.87%, 99.86% and 0.16%, respectively, for the gradient boosting classifier.  2020 by the authors.

Fully automatic detection and segmentation of abdominal aortic thrombus in post-operative CTA images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,NO,,,,"Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) based follow-up of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) treated with Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) is essential to evaluate the progress of the patient and detect complications. In this context, accurate quantification of post-operative thrombus volume is required. However, a proper evaluation is hindered by the lack of automatic, robust and reproducible thrombus segmentation algorithms. We propose a new fully automatic approach based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for robust and reproducible thrombus region of interest detection and subsequent fine thrombus segmentation. The DetecNet detection network is adapted to perform region of interest extraction from a complete CTA and a new segmentation network architecture, based on Fully Convolutional Networks and a Holistically-Nested Edge Detection Network, is presented. These networks are trained, validated and tested in 13 post-operative CTA volumes of different patients using a 4-fold cross-validation approach to provide more robustness to the results.

Same Same But DifferNet: Semi-Supervised Defect Detection with Normalizing Flows,NO,,,,"The detection of manufacturing errors is crucial in fabrication processes to ensure product quality and safety standards. Since many defects occur very rarely and their characteristics are mostly unknown a priori, their detection is still an open research question. To this end, we propose DifferNet: It leverages the descriptiveness of features extracted by convolutional neural networks to estimate their density using normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are well-suited to deal with low dimensional data distributions. However, they struggle with the high dimensionality of images. Therefore, we employ a multi-scale feature extractor which enables the normalizing flow to assign meaningful likelihoods to the images. Based on these likelihoods we develop a scoring function that indicates defects. Moreover, propagating the score back to the image enables pixel-wise localization. To achieve a high robustness and performance we exploit multiple transformations in training and evaluation. In contrast to most other methods, ours does not require a large number of training samples and performs well with as low as 16 images. We demonstrate the superior performance over existing approaches on the challenging and newly proposed MVTec AD [4] and Magnetic Tile Defects [14] datasets.","Rudolph, M.; Wandt, B.; Rosenhahn, B.",10.1109/WACV48630.2021.00195,conferencePaper,C6FL2C28,2021,,1

Anticipating the oncoming integration into intelligent sensor devices, we compare hand-crafted features for the detection of a limited number of objects against some typical convolutional neural network architectures. Experiments on some state-of-the-art datasets, addressing detection tasks, show that for some problems the increased complexity of neural networks is not reflected by a large increase in accuracy.

A ship detection method based on cascade CNN in SAR images,NO,,,,"According to the sparse characteristic of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, a ship detection method based on the cascaded convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, which combines BING with Fast R-CNN in a cascaded way while taking the accuracy and speed into account. Firstly, a smoothing operator is added on the original gradient operator to tackle the speckle noise of SAR images. And the number of image size and candidate proposals are reduced according the distribution of ships in SAR images. After these improvements, the region proposal method gets more accurate without additional computations. Then, a cascade Fast R-CNN detection framework is designed to detect ships fastly and accurately. Its front simple CNN is responsible for rejecting the obvious background regions, and the back complex CNN is responsible for conducting classification and regression for the high probability candidate regions.

The ability of machine learning to automatically identify signals of interest in these large InSAR datasets has already been demonstrated, but data-driven techniques, such as convolutional neutral networks (CNN) require balanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to effectively differentiate between real deformation and noise. As only a small proportion of volcanoes are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine learning for detecting volcanic unrest is more challenging than many other applications. In this paper, we address this problem using synthetic interferograms to train the AlexNet CNN. The synthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns based on a Monte Carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2) stratified atmospheric effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent atmospheric effects based on statistical simulations of correlated noise. The AlexNet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms that trained using real interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive predictive value (PPV). However, the models used to generate the synthetic signals are a simplification of the natural processes, so we retrain the CNN with a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models and selected real examples, achieving a final PPV of 82%. Although applying atmospheric corrections to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is relatively simple to apply them to the small subset of positive results. This further improves the detection performance without a significant increase in computational burden (PPV of 100%). Thus, we demonstrate that training with synthetic examples can improve the ability of CNNs to detect volcano deformation in satellite images, and propose an efficient workflow for the development of automated systems.  2019 Elsevier Inc.","Anantrasirichai, N.; Biggs, J.; Albino, F.; Bull, D.",10.1016/j.rse.2019.04.032,journalArticle,YPMBBZJ8,2019,,1

Adrenal lesions detection on low-contrast CT images using fully convolutional networks with multi-scale integration,NO,,,,"Adrenal lesions include a wide variety of benign and malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland, and are seen in up to 5% of computed tomography (CT) examinations of the abdomen. Better identification of these lesions is important for effective management and patient prognosis. Detection on low-contrast CT images, however, even for experienced physicians can be difficult and error-prone, because the lesions are often problematic to be separated from the normal surrounding structures. Existing lesion detection techniques have problems in identifying and differentiating low-contrast tumors, which is related to their use of low-level features rather than high level of semantics. Hence we propose an automated approach using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and multi-scale integration to detect adrenal lesion on low-contrast CT scans. The architecture of FCNs includes deep, coarse, semantic information and shallow, fine, appearance information in a hierarchical manner and it enables the encoding of image-wide location and semantics, which are desirable characteristics for adrenal lesion detection. We also propose a multi-scale integration with a superpixel based random walk (MI-SRW) approach to refine the lesion boundaries on different scales. The MI-SRW technique enables us to constrain the spatial and appearance consistency and then use complementary information provided on different scales to detect adrenal lesions of various sizes and characteristics. We used 38 adrenal lesions detected on low-contrast CT and compared our approach to existing 'state-of-the-art' methods and found that our approach had superior detection performance.  2017 IEEE.","Bi, Lei; Kim, Jinman; Su, Tingwei; Fulham, Michael; Feng, Dagan; Ning, Guang",10.1109/ISBI.2017.7950660,conferencePaper,U5R9CGJL,2017,,1

A feasibility study on the development and use of a deep learning model to automate real-time monitoring of tumor position and assessment of interfraction fiducial marker migration in prostate radiotherapy patients,NO,,,,"Purpose. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the development and training of a deep learning object detection model for automating the assessment of fiducial marker migration and tracking of the prostate in radiotherapy patients. Methods and Materials. A fiducial marker detection model was trained on the YOLO v2 detection framework using approximately 20,000 pelvis kV projection images with fiducial markers labelled. The ability of the trained model to detect marker positions was validated by tracking the motion of markers in a respiratory phantom and comparing detection data with the expected displacement from a reference position. Marker migration was then assessed in 14 prostate radiotherapy patients using the detector for comparison with previously conducted studies. This was done by determining variations in intermarker distance between the first and subsequent fractions in each patient. Results. On completion of training, a detection model was developed that operated at a 96% detection efficacy and with a root mean square error of 0.3 pixels. By determining the displacement from a reference position in a respiratory phantom, experimentally and with the detector it was found that the detector was able to compute displacements with a mean accuracy of 97.8% when compared to the actual values. Interfraction marker migration was measured in 14 patients and the average and maximum  standard deviation marker migration were found to be 2.00.9mm and 2.30.9mm, respectively. Conclusion. This study demonstrates the benefits of pairing deep learning object detection, and image-guided radiotherapy and how a workflow to automate the assessment of organ motion and seed migration during prostate radiotherapy can be developed.

Using LIP to gloss over faces in single-stage face detection networks,NO,,,,"This work shows that it is possible to fool/attack recent state-of-the-art face detectors which are based on the single-stage networks. Successfully attacking face detectors could be a serious malware vulnerability when deploying a smart surveillance system utilizing face detectors. In addition, for the privacy concern, it helps prevent faces being harvested and stored in the server. We show that existing adversarial perturbation methods are not effective to perform such an attack, especially when there are multiple faces in the inut image. This is because the adversarial perturbation specifically generated for one face may disrupt the adversarial perturbation for another face. In this paper, we call this problem the Instance Perturbation Interference (IPI) problem. This IPI problem is addressed by studying the relationship between the deep neural network receptive field and the adversarial perturbation. Besides the single-stage face detector, we find that the IPI problem also exists on the first stage of the Faster-RCNN, the commonly used two-stage object detector. As such, we propose the Localized Instance Perturbation (LIP) that confines the adversarial perturbation inside the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) of a target to perform the attack. Experimental results show the LIP method massively outperforms existing adversarial perturbation generation methods  often by a factor of 2 to 10.

"Beyond Counting: Comparisons of Density Maps for Crowd Analysis Tasks-Counting, Detection, and Tracking",NO,,,,"For crowded scenes, the accuracy of object-based computer vision methods declines when the images are low-resolution and objects have severe occlusions. Taking counting methods for example, almost all the recent state-of-the-art counting methods bypass explicit detection and adopt regression-based methods to directly count the objects of interest. Among regression-based methods, density map estimation, where the number of objects inside a subregion is the integral of the density map over that subregion, is especially promising because it preserves spatial information, which makes it useful for both counting and localization (detection and tracking). With the power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) the counting performance has improved steadily. The goal of this paper is to evaluate density maps generated by density estimation methods on a variety of crowd analysis tasks, including counting, detection, and tracking. Most existing CNN methods produce density maps with resolution that is smaller than the original images, due to the downsample strides in the convolution/pooling operations. To produce an original-resolution density map, we also evaluate a classical CNN that uses a sliding window regressor to predict the density for every pixel in the image. We also consider a fully convolutional adaptation, with skip connections from lower convolutional layers to compensate for loss in spatial information during upsampling. In our experiments, we found that the lower-resolution density maps sometimes have better counting performance. In contrast, the original-resolution density maps improved localization tasks, such as detection and tracking, compared with bilinear upsampling the lower-resolution density maps. Finally, we also propose several metrics for measuring the quality of a density map, and relate them to experiment results on counting and localization.  1991-2012 IEEE.","Kang, Di; Ma, Zheng; Chan, Antoni B.",10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2837153,journalArticle,G22UWTHL,2019,,1
Real-time vehicle detection and tracking based on enhanced Tiny YOLOV3 algorithm,NO,,,,"For intelligent vehicles and advanced driving assistant systems, real-time and accurate vehicle objects detection and tracking through on-board visual sensors are conducive to discovering potential dangers, and can take timely warning to drivers or measures to control vehicle braking and steering systems to avoid traffic accidents by active safety system. In recent years, vehicle detection based on deep learning has become a research hotspot. Although the deep learning method has made a significant breakthrough in vehicle detection precision, it will lead to high missed detection rate of small vehicle targets and rely on expensive computing resources in visual vehicle detection tasks, which is difficult to achieve in embedded real-time applications. Further analysis shows that the main reason for the above problems is that deep convolution neural network cannot reasonably prune network layer parameters, especially cannot reasonably utilize the shallow semantic information. On the contrary, a series of operations at the lower sampling layers will lead to the loss of vehicle information, especially for the small vehicle objects. Therefore, how to effectively extract and utilize the semantic information of small vehicle objects is a problem to be solved in this paper. On this basis, the problem of pruning network layer parameters reasonably was discussed. For the detection algorithm, on the one hand, based on visual analysis of receptive field of Tiny YOLOV3 network shallow layers, the use of shallow semantic information was enhanced by constructing a shallow feature pyramid structure, on the other hand, the shallow down sampling layer was replaced by convolution layer to reduce the semantic information loss of shallow network layers and increase the shallow layer features of vehicle objects to be extracted. Combine the above 2 aspects, the enhanced Tiny YOLOV3 network was proposed. For the tracking algorithm, because of the high frame rate of the vehicle-mounted camera, assuming that the vehicle objects in the adjacent frame moving uniformly without considering the image information, Kalman filter algorithm was used to track the vehicle target, and its observation position was estimated optimally. The proposed enhanced Tiny YOLO V3 network was trained by using 50 000 images collected by the on-board vehicle camera during the day and night. The training strategy included pre-training model, multi-scale training, batch normalization and data augment methods, which same as Tiny YOLOV3 network. On the vehicle Jetson TX2 embedded platform, 8 groups of comparative experiments were carried out with Tiny YOLOV3 model, including day and night traffic scenes. The experimental results showed that compared with Tiny YOLO V3 model,the mean precision rate of the enhanced Tiny YOLOV3 model proposed in this paper was improved by 4.6%, the mean detection error rate was reduced by 0.5%, the mean missing detection rate was reduced by 7.4%, and the mean time consumption was increased by 43.8 ms/frame without tracking algorithm. After adding the vehicle tracking algorithm, the mean precision rate was improved by 10.6%, the mean detection error rate was reduced by 1.2%, the mean missing detection rate was reduced by 23.6%, and the mean operation speed was 5 times faster than that of the Tiny YOLOV3 model, reaching 30 frame/s. The study provides an important guidance for embedded vehicle detection and tracking algorithm application in intelligent vehicles and advanced driving assistant systems.  2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Evaluation of vegetation indices (VIs) to detect twister disease of onion using sentinel-2 imagery,NO,,,,"Traditional plant disease detection is time consuming and costly, thus an inexpensive and faster alternative method of detection is needed to send early warning to farmers to prevent pests and disease infestation and for proper intervention. To provide timely and accurate detection in twister disease of onion, remote sensing was exploited using Sentinel 2 imageries. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the VIS-NIR region of the image were evaluated for their capability to detect twister disease. VIs were subjected to regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices and severity index of onion twister disease. Vegetation indices with strong relationship to twister disease were selected and further used in unsupervised ISODATA classification. Overall accuracy of classification generated from vegetation indices were calculated based on confusion matrix using ground truth points collected from field work to identify the most suitable index based on highest overall accuracy. It was found out that NDVI and GNDVI has the highest coefficient of determination (R2) indicating a strong relationship to the disease severity. Results of the classification show that GNDVI, PSSRa and NDVI obtained the highest overall accuracy. This indicates that these 3 VIs can be used for detection of twister disease in the field since it gives better discrimination and high accuracies. Hence, VI's generated from Sentinel 2 imagery has the potential in detection, monitoring and management of twister disease of onion in the field.  2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

Automatic slice identification in 3D medical images with a ConvNet regressor,NO,,,,"Identification of anatomical regions of interest is a prerequisite in many medical image analysis tasks. We propose a method that automatically identifies a slice of interest (SOI) in 3D images with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) regressor. In 150 chest CT scans two reference slices were manually identified: one containing the aortic root and another superior to the aortic arch. In two independent experiments, the ConvNet regressor was trained with 100 CTs to determine the distance between each slice and the SOI in a CT. To identify the SOI, a first order polynomial was fitted through the obtained distances. In 50 test scans, the mean distances between the reference and the automatically identified slices were 5.7mm (4.0 slices) for the aortic root and 5.6mm (3.7 slices) for the aortic arch.

Two-Stage YOLOv2 for Accurate License-Plate Detection in Complex Scenes,NO,,,,"License-plate detection is an important preprocessing step in the vehicle license-plate recognition system, which is one of the key components of intelligent transport systems (ITSs). In this paper, we proposed a two-stage YOLOv2 method for accurate license-plate detection. The first stage detects cars and then the second stage detects the license-plate in the detected car region. The proposed method can detect license-plates even in complex scenes including nighttime scenes, blurry images, various sizes of cars, and various other objects. Another contribution of this work is that we constructed a database of Japanese license-plates. There is no public database of Japanese license-plate. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method improves the detection accuracy over the original YOLOv2.  2019 IEEE.","Yonetsu, Shohei; Iwamoto, Yutaro; Chen, Yen Wei",10.1109/ICCE.2019.8661944,conferencePaper,HMXVLPJQ,2019,,1
Deep learning and anthropometric plane based workflow monitoring by detecting and tracking workers,NO,,,,"The worker productivity, a critical variable in project management, significantly affects the progress of a project. The key to measuring productivity is analysis of activities, which provides necessary information by identifying how workers spend their time at certain areas in the site. In this work, we propose a novel joint image-trajectory space for automatic detection and tracking of workers using a single fixed camera. A two-branch convolutional neural network detects workers and their body joints. Instead of tracking the body joints in the image space, we transform detected joints onto virtual parallel planes called ""Anthropometric Planes"". The detected joints are, then, tracked using a Kalman Filter on these planes which are created based on anthropometric measures of an average American male. Finally, an uncertainty measure is introduced to reduce the number of identity changes and to handle missing joints. The experiments conducted on an image sequence captured in a nuclear plant shows promising detection and tracking results.  Authors 2018.

Comparison of machine learned approaches for thyroid nodule characterization from shear wave elastography images,NO,,,,"Various Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed that characterize thyroid nodules using the features extracted from the B-mode ultrasound images and Shear Wave Elastography images (SWE). These features, however, are not perfect predictors of malignancy. In other domains, deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have outperformed conventional feature extraction based machine learning approaches. In general, fully trained CNNs require substantial volumes of data, motivating several efforts to use transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs. In this context, we sought to compare the performance of conventional feature extraction, fully trained CNNs, and transfer learning based, pre-trained CNNs for the detection of thyroid malignancy from ultrasound images. We compared these approaches applied to a data set of 964 B-mode and SWE images from 165 patients. The data were divided into 80% training/validation and 20% testing data. The highest accuracies achieved on the testing data for the conventional feature extraction, fully trained CNN, and pre-trained CNN were 0.80, 0.75, and 0.83 respectively. In this application, classification using a pre-trained network yielded the best performance, potentially due to the relatively limited sample size and sub-optimal architecture for the fully trained CNN.  2018 SPIE.","Pereira, Carina; Dighe, Manjiri; Alessio, Adam M.",10.1117/12.2294572,conferencePaper,PFMDQ8YJ,2018,,1
An Unsupervised Patch-Based Approach for Exoplanet Detection by Direct Imaging,NO,,,,"The search for exoplanet is a very active topic in astronomy. Exoplanet detection by direct imaging requires both dedicated instruments to mask out the host star and careful image processing methods. Data processing is challenging because the exoplanet signal is very faint and hidden in a much stronger non-stationary background displaying strong spatial correlations. In contrast to previous detection methods, we explicitly model the spatial correlations of the background and design a completely unsupervised method that accounts for the background non-stationarity. From a time series of observations, we learn a local model of the distribution of background patches. Significant sources are then detected with a generalized likelihood ratio test. The sub-pixel location and flux of each detected exoplanet are estimated jointly to a refining of the background model. Each detected source is removed from the data, following an orthogonal matching pursuit strategy. The stopping criterion is based on a control of false alarms. We compare the proposed algorithm to three state-of-the-art exoplanet detection methods on datasets obtained with SPHERE instrument operating at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. We show a drastic improvement of the sensibility and much fewer false detections.  2018 IEEE.","Flasseur, Olivier; Denis, Loic; Thiebaut, Eric; Langlois, Maud",10.1109/ICIP.2018.8451431,conferencePaper,SCUIUHK9,2018,,1
Ship-iceberg discrimination in Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery by supervised classification,NO,,,,"The European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellites provide multispectral images with pixel sizes down to 10 m.

It discriminates between objects like ships, islands, wakes, and icebergs, ice floes, and clouds with accuracy better than 90%. Pan-sharpening the infrared bands leads to classification and discrimination of ice floes and clouds better than 95%.

An approach to detect cavities in X-ray astronomical images using granular convolutional neural networks,NO,,,,"Detection of cavities in X-ray astronomical images has become a field of interest, since the flourishing studies on black holes and the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In this paper, an approach is proposed to detect cavities in X-ray astronomical images using our newly designed Granular Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) based classifiers. The raw data are firstly preprocessed to obtain images of the observed objects, i.e., galaxies or galaxy clusters. In each image, pixels are classified into three categories, (1) the faint backgrounds (BKG), (2) the cavity regions (CAV), and (3) the bright central gas regions (CNT). And the sample sets are then generated by dividing large images into subimages with a window size according to the cavities' scale. Since the number of BKG samples are far more than the other types, to achieve balanced training sets, samples from the major class are split into subsets, i.e., granule. Then a group of three-convolutional-layer granular CNN networks without subsampling layers are designed as the classifiers, and trained with the labeled granular sample sets. Finally, the trained GCNN classifiers are applied to new observations, so as to estimate the cavity regions with a voting strategy and locate them with elliptical profiles on the raw observation images. Experiments and applications of our approach are demonstrated on 40 X-ray astronomical observations retrieved from Chandra Data Archive (CDA). Comparisons among our approach, the -model fitting and the Unsharp Masking (UM) methods were also performed, which prove our approach was more accurate and robust.

"An Incremental Framework for Video-Based Traffic Sign Detection, Tracking, and Recognition",NO,,,,"Video-based traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition is one of the important components for the intelligent transport systems. Extensive research has shown that pretty good performance can be obtained on public data sets by various state-of-the-art approaches, especially the deep learning methods. However, deep learning methods require extensive computing resources. In addition, these approaches mostly concentrate on single image detection and recognition task, which is not applicable in real-world applications. Different from previous research, we introduce a unified incremental computational framework for traffic sign detection, tracking, and recognition task using the mono-camera mounted on a moving vehicle under non-stationary environments. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) to enhance detection performance by utilizing the contextual information, this paper innovatively utilizes the spatial distribution prior of the traffic signs; 2) to improve the tracking performance and localization accuracy under non-stationary environments, a new efficient incremental framework containing off-line detector, online detector, and motion model predictor together is designed for traffic sign detection and tracking simultaneously; and 3) to get a more stable classification output, a scale-based intra-frame fusion method is proposed. We evaluate our method on two public data sets and the performance has shown that the proposed system can obtain results comparable with the deep learning method with less computing resource in a near-real-time manner.  2000-2011 IEEE.","Yuan, Yuan; Xiong, Zhitong; Wang, Qi",10.1109/TITS.2016.2614548,journalArticle,R4QNZPWT,2017,,1
A deep learning-based approach for real-time rodent detection and behaviour classification,NO,,,,"Animal models are helpful to evaluate the effects of some drugs in the treatment of brain diseases, such as the case of the Open Field Maze. Usually, these tests are recorded in video and analysed afterwards to carry out manual annotations about the activity and behaviour of the rat. Usually, these videos must be watched repeatedly to ensure correct annotations, but they are prone to become a tedious task and are highly likely to produce human errors. Existing commercial systems for automatic detection of the rat and classification of its behaviours may become inaccessible for research teams that cannot afford the license cost. Motivated by the latter, we propose a methodology for simultaneous rat detection and behaviour classification using inexpensive hardware in this work. Our proposal is a Deep Learning-based two-step methodology to simultaneously detect the rat in the test and classify its behaviour. In the first step, a single shot detector network is used to detect the rat; then, the systems crop the image using the bounding box to generate a sequence of six images that input our BehavioursNet network to classify the rodents behaviour. Finally, based on the results of these steps, the system generates an ethogram for the complete video, a trajectory plot, a heatmap plot for most visited regions and a video showing the rats detection and its behaviours. Our results show that it is possible to perform these tasks at a processing rate of 23 Hz, with a low error of 6 pixels in the detection and a first approach to classify ambiguous behaviours such as resting and grooming, with an average precision of 60%, which is competitive with that reported in the literature.  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cocoma-Ortega, J.

HoloDetect: Few-Shot Learning for Error Detection [arXiv],YES,,,,"We introduce a few-shot learning framework for error detection. We show that data augmentation (a form of weak supervision) is key to training high-quality, ML-based error detection models that require minimal human involvement. Our framework consists of two parts: (1) an expressive model to learn rich representations that capture the inherent syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of errors; and (2) a data augmentation model that, given a small seed of clean records, uses dataset-specific transformations to automatically generate additional training data. Our key insight is to learn data augmentation policies from the noisy input dataset in a weakly supervised manner. We show that our framework detects errors with an average precision of ~94% and an average recall of ~93% across a diverse array of datasets that exhibit different types and amounts of errors. We compare our approach to a comprehensive collection of error detection methods, ranging from traditional rule-based methods to ensemble-based and active learning approaches. We show that data augmentation yields an average improvement of 20 F1 points while it requires access to 3 fewer labeled examples compared to other ML approaches.

Exploring intelligent image recognition technology of football robot using omnidirectional vision of internet of things,NO,,,,"With the improvement and development of intelligent robot technology, such technology is gradually used to improve the intelligence of national sports fitness. The study aims to explore the intelligent image processing methods based on football robots. First, the moving dynamic image is recognized and processed, and computer vision is proposed to simulate animal vision and collect static and dynamic images of football based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Second, a football robot platform is designed to process the collected graphic dataset. Finally, the feature vector and combination matrix of the image in the dataset are calculated, and the obtained feature matrix is input into AdaBoost to obtain the recognition result of football images. The experimental results show that the system error of the auxiliary recognition technology based on IoT is 0.63, and the detection error rate of the auxiliary recognition technology based on AdaBoost is negatively correlated with the number of features. It is concluded that the more training the samples receive, the smaller the detection error rate of the algorithm is. Compared with similar algorithms, the recognition accuracy of the designed algorithm in different datasets is more than 80.1%, and the recognition result is better than that of similar algorithms. Therefore, the algorithm designed and the results obtained prove the feasibility of the proposed intelligent recognition technology in football image recognition.

Simultaneous iris and periocular region detection using coarse annotations,NO,,,,"In this work, we propose to detect the iris and periocular regions simultaneously using coarse annotations and two well-known object detectors: YOLOv2 and Faster R-CNN. We believe coarse annotations can be used in recognition systems based on the iris and periocular regions, given the much smaller engineering effort required to manually annotate the training images. We manually made coarse annotations of the iris and periocular regions (122K images from the visible (VIS) spectrum and 38K images from the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum). The iris annotations in the NIR databases were generated semi-automatically by first applying an iris segmentation CNN and then performing a manual inspection. These annotations were made for 11 well-known public databases (3 NIR and 8 VIS) designed for the iris-based recognition problem, and are publicly available to the research community1. Experimenting our proposal on these databases, we highlight two results. First, the Faster R-CNN + Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) model reported an Intersection over Union (IoU) higher than YOLOv2 (91.86% vs 85.30%). Second, the detection of the iris and periocular regions being performed simultaneously is as accurate as performed separately, but with a lower computational cost, i.e. two tasks were carried out at the cost of one.  2019 IEEE.","Lucio, Diego R.; Laroca, Rayson; Zanlorensi, Luiz A.; Moreira, Gladston; Menotti, David",10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2019.00032,conferencePaper,Z9BYZ9CF,2019,,1

In this way, keypoint descriptors are used in the scenarios where descriptors' volatility due to minor image distortions is minimized and, thus, performances of keypoint matching are prospectively maximized. Experimental verification on selected types of keypoint descriptors fully confirmed this hypothesis.

"Clodsa: A tool for augmentation in classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks",NO,,,,"Background: Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to bioimaging problems; however, these methods are highly data demanding. An approach to deal with the lack of data and avoid overfitting is the application of data augmentation, a technique that generates new training samples from the original dataset by applying different kinds of transformations. Several tools exist to apply data augmentation in the context of image classification, but it does not exist a similar tool for the problems of localization, detection, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation that works not only with 2 dimensional images but also with multi-dimensional images (such as stacks or videos). Results: In this paper, we present a generic strategy that can be applied to automatically augment a dataset of images, or multi-dimensional images, devoted to classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation. The augmentation method presented in this paper has been implemented in the open-source package CLoDSA. To prove the benefits of using CLoDSA, we have employed this library to improve the accuracy of models for Malaria parasite classification, stomata detection, and automatic segmentation of neural structures. Conclusions: CLoDSA is the first, at least up to the best of our knowledge, image augmentation library for object classification, localization, detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation that works not only with 2 dimensional images but also with multi-dimensional images.  2019 The Author(s).","Casado-Garcia, angela; Dominguez, Cesar; Garcia-Dominguez, Manuel; Heras, Jonathan; Ines, Adrian; Mata, Eloy; Pascual, Vico",10.1186/s12859-019-2931-1,journalArticle,KGFVWN58,2019,,1
Helping to detect legal swimming pools with deep learning and data visualization,NO,,,,"The municipalities have, as a primary responsibility, the administrative management of their territory. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) and orthophoto maps can help to handle this task. One of the great difficulties they face is related to the continuous and quick changes that the territory suffers, and whose inspection is challenging to support. An example of this is the maintenance of the swimming pool registration system, in order to validate or license them. Indeed, it requires a substantial manual intervention, yet. This paper describes a system prototype for helping on detecting swimming pools on aerial images. It explores and integrates artificial intelligence (AI), systems integration, GIS, and data visualization. The AI improves the detection of objects, and middleware supports the integration of the detection results with other municipality systems for georeferencing and private property data licensing data crossing.

Calibrate and Refine! A Novel and Agile Framework for ASR-error Robust Intent Detection,NO,,,,"The past ten years have witnessed the rapid development of text-based intent detection, whose benchmark performances have already been taken to a remarkable level by deep learning techniques. However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors are inevitable in real-world applications due to the environment noise, unique speech patterns and etc, leading to sharp performance drop in state-of-the-art text-based intent detection models. Essentially, this phenomenon is caused by the semantic drift brought by ASR errors and most existing works tend to focus on designing new model structures to reduce its impact, which is at the expense of versatility and flexibility. Different from previous one-piece model, in this paper, we propose a novel and agile framework called CR-ID for ASR error robust intent detection with two plug-and-play modules, namely semantic drift calibration module (SDCM) and phonemic refinement module (PRM), which are both model-agnostic and thus could be easily integrated to any existing intent detection models without modifying their structures. Experimental results on SNIPS dataset show that, our proposed CR-ID framework achieves competitive performance and outperform all the baseline methods on ASR outputs, which verifies that CR-ID can effectively alleviate the semantic drift caused by ASR errors.  2022, CC0.","Zhou, Peilin; Chong, Dading; Wang, Helin; Zeng, Qingcheng",10.48550/arXiv.2205.11008,journalArticle,BK2T9YXN,2022,,1

A dual neural network for object detection in UAV images,NO,,,,"Computer vision analysis in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) represents a major trend in the future development. Object detection in UAV images is one of the important techonlogies to analyze scene information. However, the UAV image includes small and dense targets, which easily leads to errors of missed detection. In this paper, we propose a dual neural network review method, which quickly screens the missed targets in the one-stage detection by classifying the secondary features of the suspected target regions, so as to achieve high quality detection of small targets. Firstly, the one-stage detector recognizes UAV images, and the result with confidence greater than or equal to the threshold is detected as the target. The result less than the threshold are considered as suspected areas containing missed targets. Secondly, the feature map of UAV image is extracted by VGG backbone. The feature map and the location information of the suspected areas are combined to secondary identification. Then, the features of the dual network are late fusion, and the re-identified results guide the initial confidence addition. After the addition, regions with confidence greater than the threshold are considered as targets. Finally, we synthesize the targets of initial detection and secondary identification to obtain the final detection results.

First, edge-aware models only use edge feature to improve segmentation features but lack of utilizing the complementarity of them. Second, the problem of losing part of information in the process of extracting features in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) leads to the incompleteness of final result. In this paper, we proposed a criss-cross refined salient object detection method based on hybrid attention to solve these problems. Specifically, we applied a Criss-Cross Attention module (CCA) to capture useful contextual information of surrounding pixels from long-range dependencies effectively. Fully considering the complementary between salient detection and edge information, our model simultaneously refines multilevel features of SOD and edge detection by overlapping a Cross Refinement Unit (CRU). And finally we used a U-Net to output the refined result. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of low-contrast scenes, optimize the problem of partial missing and error detection of salient objects. Besides, our method achieved state-of-the-art performance in three different indicators.",Zhenyang Lin; Peiting Li; Wenjun Huang; Junbin Yuan; Kanoksak Wattanachote; Yongyi Gong,10.1109/ICDH51081.2020.00013,conferencePaper,9IULKZTF,2020,,1

Faster R-CNN for marine organism detection and recognition using data augmentation,NO,,,,"Recently, Faster Region-based CNN(Faster R-CNN) has achieved marvelous accomplishment in object detection and recognition. In this paper, Faster R-CNN is applied to marine organism detection and recognition. However, the training of Faster R-CNN requires a mass of labeled samples which are difficult to obtain for marine organism. Therefore, three data augmentation methods are proposed dedicated to underwater-imaging. Specifically, the inverse process of underwater image restoration is used to simulate different marine turbulence environments. Perspective transformation is proposed to simulate different view of camera shooting. Illumination synthesis is used to simulate different marine illuminating environments. The performance of each data augmentation method, together with Faster R-CNN is evaluated by experiments on real world underwater dataset, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for marine organism detection and recognition.  2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Zhou, Hao; Huang, Hai; Yang, Xu; Zhang, Lu; Qi, Lu",10.1145/3177404.3177433,conferencePaper,UDZ7U83Y,2017,,1
Estimating ejection fraction and left ventricle volume using deep convolutional networks,NO,,,,"We present a fully automated method to estimate the ejection fraction, the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes from cardiac MRI images. These values can be manually measured by a cardiologist but the process is slow and time consuming. The method is based on localizing the left ventricle of the image. Then, the slices are cleaned, re-ordered, and preprocessed using the DICOM meta fields. The endsystolic and end-diastolic images for each slice are identified. Finally, the end-systolic and end-diastolic images are passed to a neural network to estimate the volumes.

A search space strategy for pedestrian detection and localization in world coordinates,NO,,,,"The focus of this work is detecting pedestrians, captured in a surveillance setting, and locating them in world coordinates. Commonly adopted search strategies operate in the image plane to address the object detection problem with machine learning, for example using scale-space pyramid with the sliding windows methodology or object proposals. In contrast, here a new search space is presented, which exploits camera calibration information and geometric priors. The proposed search strategy will facilitate detectors to directly estimate pedestrian presence in world coordinates of interest. Results are demonstrated on real world outdoor collected data along a path in dim light conditions, with the goal to locate pedestrians in world coordinates. The proposed search strategy indicate a mean error under 20 cm, while image plane search methods, with additional processing adopted for localization, yielded around or above 30 cm in mean localization error. This while only observing 3-4% of patches required by the image plane searches at the same task.  2018 by SCITEPRESS  Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Towards Visible and Thermal Drone Monitoring with Convolutional Neural Networks,NO,,,,"This paper reports a visible and thermal drone monitoring system that integrates deep-learning-based detection and tracking modules. The biggest challenge in adopting deep learning methods for drone detection is the paucity of training drone images especially thermal drone images. To address this issue, we develop two data augmentation techniques. One is a model-based drone augmentation technique that automatically generates visible drone images with a bounding box label on the drone's location. The other is exploiting an adversarial data augmentation methodology to create thermal drone images. To track a small flying drone, we utilize the residual information between consecutive image frames. Finally, we present an integrated detection and tracking system that outperforms the performance of each individual module containing detection or tracking only. The experiments show that, even being trained on synthetic data, the proposed system performs well on real-world drone images with complex background. The USC drone detection and tracking dataset with user labeled bounding boxes is available to the public.

A novel fully automated liver and HCC tumor segmentation system using morphological operations,NO,,,,"Early detection and diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most discriminating step in liver cancer management. Image processing is primarily used, where fast and accurate Computed Tomography (CT) liver image segmentation is required for effective clinical studies and treatment plans. The purpose of this research is to develop an automated HCC detection and diagnosis system, able to work with HCC lesions from liver CT images, with maximum sensitivity and minimum specificity. Our proposed system carried out automated segmentation of HCC lesions from 3D liver CT images. First, based on chosen histogram thresholds, we create a mask to predict the segmentation area by exploiting prior knowledge of the location and shape. Next, we obtain a 3D HCC lesion using an appropriate combination of cancer area pixel density calculations, histogram analysis and morphological processing. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we carried out a series of experiments using 31 CT cases, comprised of 18 HCC lesions and 13 non HCC lesions. The acquired CT images (in DICOM format) had 128 channels of 512; 512 pixels, each with pixel space varying between 0.54 and 0.85. Simulation results showed 92.68% accuracy and a false positive incidence of 9.75%. These were also compared and validated against manual segmentation carried out by a radiologist and other widely used image segmentation methods. Fully automated HCC detection can be efficiently used to aid medical professionals in diagnosing HCC. A limitation of this research is that the performance was evaluated on a small dataset, which does not allow us to confirm robustness of this system. For future work, we will collect additional clinical and CT image data to ensure comprehensive evaluation and clinical validation. We also intend to apply this automated HCC detection and diagnosis system to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets, as well as adapting it for diagnosing different liver diseases using state-of-the-art feature extraction and selection, and machine learning classification techniques.

Novel trace chemical detection algorithms: A comparative study,NO,,,,"Algorithms for standoff detection and estimation of trace chemicals in hyperspectral images in the IR band are a key component for a variety of applications relevant to law-enforcement and the intelligence communities. Performance of these methods is impacted by the spectral signature variability due to presence of contaminants, surface roughness, nonlinear dependence on abundances as well as operational limitations on the compute platforms. In this work we provide a comparative performance and complexity analysis of several classes of algorithms as a function of noise levels, error distribution, scene complexity, and spatial degrees of freedom. The algorithm classes we analyze and test include adaptive cosine estimator (ACE and modifications to it), compressive/sparse methods, Bayesian estimation, and machine learning. We explicitly call out the conditions under which each algorithm class is optimal or near optimal as well as their built-in limitations and failure modes.  2017 SPIE.","Raz, Gil; Murphy, Cara; Georgan, Chelsea; Greenwood, Ross; Prasanth, R.K.; Myers, Travis; Goyal, Anish; Kelley, David; Wood, Derek; Kotidis, Petros",10.1117/12.2258429,conferencePaper,6TPJGKTY,2017,,1
