READ: Aggregating Reconstruction Error into Out-of-distribution Detection,Academia,AAAI,journalArticle,2022,,,outliers detection,"Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial to the safe deployment of a classifier in the real world. However, deep neural networks are known to be overconfident for abnormal data. Existing works directly design score function by mining the inconsistency from classifier for in-distribution (ID) and OOD. In this paper, we further complement this inconsistency with reconstruction error, based on the assumption that an autoencoder trained on ID data can not reconstruct OOD as well as ID. We propose a novel method, READ (Reconstruction Error Aggregated Detector), to unify inconsistencies from classifier and autoencoder. Specifically, the reconstruction error of raw pixels is transformed to latent space of classifier. We show that the transformed reconstruction error bridges the semantic gap and inherits detection performance from the original. Moreover, we propose an adjustment strategy to alleviate the overconfidence problem of autoencoder according to a fine-grained characterization of OOD data. Under two scenarios of pre-training and retraining, we respectively present two variants of our method, namely READ-MD (Mahalanobis Distance) only based on pre-trained classifier and READ-ED (Euclidean Distance) which retrains the classifier. Our methods do not require access to test time OOD data for fine-tuning hyperparameters. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art OOD detection algorithms. On a CIFAR-10 pre-trained WideResNet, our method reduces the average FPR@95TPR by up to 9.8% compared with previous state-of-the-art.  2022, CC BY-NC-ND.","Jiang, Wenyu; Cheng, Hao; Chen, Mingcai; Feng, Shuai; Ge, Yuxin; Wang, Chongjun",PO,YES,10.48550/arXiv.2206.07459,G-ODIN-I / G-ODIN-C / G-ODIN-E,(1) SVHN (2) LSUN (3) Textures (4) Places365 (5) CIFAR-100 (6) TIN (7) LSUN (8) TIN (9) iSUN,-,-,NN and autoencoder,better,-,(1) AUROC (2) FPR@95TPR,,P78F43QV,-,12,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2,0.0,2.0,https://github.com/lygjwy/READ,

Complaint-Driven Training Data Debugging at Interactive Speeds,Academia,ACM SIGMOD,conferencePaper,2022,ML4DC,tabular,mislabel correction,"Modern databases support queries that perform model inference (inference queries). Although powerful and widely used, inference queries are susceptible to incorrect results if the model is biased due to training data errors. Recently, prior work Rain proposed complaint-driven data debugging which uses user-specified errors in the output of inference queries (Complaints) to rank erroneous training examples that most likely caused the complaint. This can help users better interpret results and debug training sets. Rain combined influence analysis from the ML literature with relaxed query provenance polynomials from the DB literature to approximate the derivative of complaints w.r.t. training examples. Although effective, the runtime is O(|T|d), where T and d are the training set and model sizes, due to its reliance on the model's second order derivatives (the Hessian). On a Wide Resnet Network (WRN) model with 1.5 million parameters, it takes 1 minute to debug a complaint. We observe that most complaint debugging costs are independent of the complaint, and that modern models are overparameterized. In response, Rain++ uses precomputation techniques, based on non-trivial insights unique to data debugging, to reduce debugging latencies to a constant factor independent of model size. We also develop optimizations when the queried database is known apriori, and for standing queries over streaming databases. Combining these optimizations in Rain++ ensures interactive debugging latencies (1ms) on models with millions of parameters.  2022 ACM.","Flokas, Lampros; Wu, Weiyuan; Liu, Yejia; Wang, Jiannan; Verma, Nakul; Wu, Eugene",PO,YES,10.1145/3514221.3517849,Rain (the initial implementation they want to improve the engineering performances),"(1) MNIST, (2) Fashion-MNIST,  (3) CIFAR-10, (4) SST-2, (5) ADULT",any,-,any,"even if it uses approximations, it provides similar results (sometimes better, sometimes worse)","10 times faster online, with some pre-computation required before","precision, recall, AUC of top-k, like in the initial paper",,X8C6K9G7,"the paper is only focussed on optimization, not really data-cleaning",12,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2,2.0,0.0,-,

Performance evaluation of outlier detection techniques in production timeseries: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Academia,Expert Syst. Appl.,journalArticle,2022,ML4DC,tabular,outliers detection,"Time-series data have been extensively collected and analyzed in many disciplines, such as stock market, medical diagnosis, meteorology, and oil and gas industry. Numerous data in these disciplines are sequence of observations measured as functions of time, which can be further used for different applications via analytical or data analytics techniques (e.g., to forecast future price, climate change, etc.). However, presence of outliers can cause significant uncertainties to interpretation results; hence, it is essential to remove the outliers accurately and efficiently before conducting any further analysis. A total of 17 techniques that belong to statistical, regression-based, and machine learning (ML) based categories for outlier detection in timeseries are applied to the oil and gas production data analysis. 15 of these methods are utilized for production data analysis for the first time. Two state-of-the-art and high-performance techniques are then selected for data cleaning which require minimum control and time complexity. Moreover, performances of these techniques are evaluated based on several metrics including the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa to rank the techniques. Results show that eight unsupervised algorithms outperform the rest of the methods based on the synthetic case study with known outliers. For example, accuracies of the eight shortlisted methods are in the range of 0.830.99 with a precision between 0.83 and 0.98, compared to 0.650.82 and 0.070.77 for the others. In addition, ML-based techniques perform better than statistical techniques. Our experimental results on real field data further indicate that the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Fulford-Blasingame methods are superior to other outlier detection frameworks for outlier detection in production data, followed by four others including density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and angle-based outlier detection (ABOD). Even though the techniques are examined with oil and gas production data, but the same data cleaning workflow can be used to detect timeseries outliers in other disciplines.  2021","Alimohammadi, Hamzeh; Nancy Chen, Shengnan",,YES,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116371,"ML-based:

Deep entity matching with adversarial active learning,Both,VLDB Journal,journalArticle,2022,ML4DC,tabular,entity matching / duplicate removal,"Entity matching (EM), as a fundamental task in data cleansing and integration, aims to identify the data records in databases that refer to the same real-world entity. While recent deep learning technologies significantly improve the performance of EM, they are often restrained by large-scale noisy data and insufficient labeled examples. In this paper, we present a novel EM approach based on deep neural networks and adversarial active learning. Specifically, we design a deep EM model to automatically complete missing textual values and capture both similarity and difference between records. Given that learning massive parameters in the deep model needs expensive labeling cost, we propose an adversarial active learning framework, which leverages active learning to collect a small amount of ""good"" examples and adversarial learning to augment the examples for stability enhancement. Additionally, to deal with large-scale databases, we present a dynamic blocking method that can be interactively tuned with the deep EM model.

TabReformer: Unsupervised Representation Learning for Erroneous Data Detection,Both,ACM/IMS Transactions on Data Science,journalArticle,2021,ML4DC,tabular,error detection,"Error detection is a crucial preliminary phase in any data analytics pipeline. Existing error detection techniques typically target specific types of errors. Moreover, most of these detection models either require user-defined rules or ample hand-labeled training examples. Therefore, in this article, we present TabReformer, a model that learns bidirectional encoder representations for tabular data. The proposed model consists of two main phases. In the first phase, TabReformer follows encoder architecture with multiple self-attention layers to model the dependencies between cells and capture tuple-level representations. Also, the model utilizes a Gaussian Error Linear Unit activation function with the Masked Data Model objective to achieve deeper probabilistic understanding. In the second phase, the model parameters are fine-tuned for the task of erroneous data detection. The model applies a data augmentation module to generate more erroneous examples to represent the minority class. The experimental evaluation considers a wide range of databases with different types of errors and distributions. The empirical results show that our solution can enhance the recall values by 32.95% on average compared with state-of-the-art techniques while reducing the manual effort by up to 48.86%.  2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Correcting Corrupted Labels Using Mode Dropping of ACGAN,Academia,International Symposium on Medical Information and Communication Technology (ISMICT),conferencePaper,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Machine learning often requires a large amount of training data, and the training data obtained from various sources is often of poor quality, such as a large number of corrupted labels. Researchers using machine learning often apply some data cleaning techniques to clean up corrupted data. There are two popular methods to clean corrupted data: one is to set manual cleaning rules, and the other is to use positive samples for machine learning or statistical methods. Our work proposes a data cleaning method based on ACGAN since it is difficult to manually formulate cleaning rules, and there are often no positive samples of training data too. Our work does not need to artificially add cleaning rules or positive samples, and subtly uses mode dropping of GAN to eliminate the impact of noisy labels on corrupted data so which can be converted to relatively clean synthetic training data. Mode dropping of ACGAN will naturally happens, which is originally a disadvantage that usually needs to be eliminated in GAN, we tom the disadvantage into advantage, ACGAN will ignore some non-subject features when generating data, so as to eliminate the impact of noisy labels. And we also apply our method to correct noisy labels on corrupted training data.  2021 IEEE.","Su, Jizhong; Gao, Xing; Qin, Yipeng; Guo, Shihui",PO,YES,10.1109/ISMICT51748.2021.9434911,-,(1) MNIST (2) Fashion-MNIST,-,-,ACGAN and MLP,See figures,-,(1) Accuracy of end ML model,,,"Very poorly written, we could consider even removing it from the reading list since I am still not sure what they did",7,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4,2.0,2.0,-,
Mislabeled Samples Adjustment Based on Self-paced Learning Framework,Academia,International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),conferencePaper,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Human have ability to detect and correct the mistakes in life events.

Deep transfer learning for multi-source entity linkage via domain adaptation,Both,arxiv,journalArticle,2021,ML4DC,tabular,entity matching / duplicate removal,"Multi-source entity linkage focuses on integrating knowledge from multiple sources by linking the records that represent the same real world entity. This is critical in high-impact applications such as data cleaning and user stitching. The state-of-the-art entity linkage pipelines mainly depend on supervised learning that requires abundant amounts of training data. However, collecting well-labeled training data becomes expensive when the data from many sources arrives incrementally over time. Moreover, the trained models can easily overfit to specific data sources, and thus fail to generalize to new sources due to significant differences in data and label distributions. To address these challenges, we present AdaMEL, a deep transfer learning framework that learns generic high-level knowledge to perform multi-source entity linkage. AdaMEL models the attribute importance that is used to match entities through an attribute-level self-attention mechanism, and leverages the massive unlabeled data from new data sources through domain adaptation to make it generic and data-source agnostic. In addition, AdaMEL is capable of incorporating an additional set of labeled data to more accurately integrate data sources with different attribute importance. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results with 8.21% improvement on average over methods based on supervised learning. Besides, it is more stable in handling different sets of data sources in less runtime. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

Picket: guarding against corrupted data in tabular data during learning and inference,Academia,VLDB Journal,journalArticle,2021,"DC4ML, DC4ML - intro only, ML4DC",tabular,error detection,"Data corruption is an impediment to modern machine learning deployments. Corrupted data can severely bias the learned model and can also lead to invalid inferences. We present, Picket, a simple framework to safeguard against data corruptions during both training and deployment of machine learning models over tabular data. For the training stage, Picket identifies and removes corrupted data points from the training data to avoid obtaining a biased model. For the deployment stage, Picket flags, in an online manner, corrupted query points to a trained machine learning model that due to noise will result in incorrect predictions. To detect corrupted data, Picket uses a self-supervised deep learning model for mixed-type tabular data, which we call PicketNet. To minimize the burden of deployment, learning a PicketNet model does not require any human-labeled data. Picket is designed as a plugin that can increase the robustness of any machine learning pipeline. We evaluate Picket on a diverse array of real-world data considering different corruption models that include systematic and adversarial noise during both training and testing. We show that Picket consistently safeguards against corrupted data during both training and deployment of various models ranging from SVMs to neural networks, beating a diverse array of competing methods that span from data quality validation models to robust outlier detection models.  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Liu, Zifan; Zhou, Zhechun; Rekatsinas, Theodoros",PO,YES,10.1007/s00778-021-00699-w,"to many to write here, see page",(1) Wine (2) Adult (3) marketing (4) Restaurant (5) Titanic (6) HTRU2,"any error. noise considered: random, systematic, adversarial",-,Detecting errors: two-stream multi-head self-attention.

Appl.,journalArticle,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are supposed to be fed with only high-quality annotated datasets. Nonetheless, in many real-world scenarios, such high quality is very hard to obtain, and datasets may be affected by any sort of image degradation and mislabelling issues.

To address this issue we propose Wise2WipedNet (W2WNet), a new two-module Convolutional Neural Network, where a Wise module exploits Bayesian inference to identify and discard spurious images during the training, and a Wiped module takes care of the final classification, while broadcasting information on the prediction confidence at inference time. The goodness of our solution is demonstrated on a number of public benchmarks addressing different image classification tasks, as well as on a real-world case study on histological image analysis.

Data cleansing for deep neural networks with storage-efficient approximation of influence functions,Industry,arxiv,journalArticle,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Identifying the influence of training data for data cleansing can improve the accuracy of deep learning. An approach with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) called SGD-influence to calculate the influence scores was proposed, but, the calculation costs are expensive. It is necessary to temporally store the parameters of the model during training phase for inference phase to calculate influence sores. In close connection with the previous method, we propose a method to reduce cache files to store the parameters in training phase for calculating inference score. We only adopt the final parameters in last epoch for influence functions calculation. In our experiments on classification, the cache size of training using MNIST dataset with our approach is 1.236 MB. On the other hand, the previous method used cache size of 1.932 GB in last epoch. It means that cache size has been reduced to 1/1,563.

Chef: A cheap and fast pipeline for iteratively cleaning label uncertainties,Academia,arxiv,journalArticle,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,mislabel correction,"High-quality labels are expensive to obtain for many machine learning tasks, such as medical image classification tasks. Therefore, probabilistic (weak) labels produced by weak supervision tools are used to seed a process in which influential samples with weak labels are identified and cleaned by several human annotators to improve the model performance. To lower the overall cost and computational overhead of this process, we propose a solution called Chef (CHEap and Fast label cleaning), which consists of the following three components. First, to reduce the cost of human annotators, we use Infl, which prioritizes the most influential training samples for cleaning and provides cleaned labels to save the cost of one human annotator. Second, to accelerate the sample selector phase and the model constructor phase, we use Increm-Infl to incrementally produce influential samples, and DeltaGrad-L to incrementally update the model. Third, we redesign the typical label cleaning pipeline so that human annotators iteratively clean smaller batch of samples rather than one big batch of samples. This yields better overall model performance and enables possible early termination when the expected model performance has been achieved. Extensive experiments show that our approach gives good model prediction performance while achieving significant speed-ups. Copyright  2021, The Authors.

This work advocates for a data-driven approach to prioritising samples for re-annotation-which we term ""active label cleaning"". We propose to rank instances according to estimated label correctness and labelling difficulty of each sample, and introduce a simulation framework to evaluate relabelling efficacy. Our experiments on natural images and on a new medical imaging benchmark show that cleaning noisy labels mitigates their negative impact on model training, evaluation, and selection.

The challenges of this entity resolution task that demand so much research attention are often rooted in the task-specificity and user-dependence of the process. Adopting deep learning techniques has the potential to lessen these challenges. In this paper, we set out to devise an entity resolution method that builds on the robustness conferred by deep autoencoders to reduce human-involvement costs. Specifically, we reduce the cost of training deep entity resolution models by performing unsupervised representation learning. This unveils a transferability property of the resulting model that can further reduce the cost of applying the approach to new datasets by means of transfer learning. Finally, we reduce the cost of labeling training data through an active learning approach that builds on the properties conferred by the use of deep autoencoders.

Research on Error Label Screening Method Based on Convolutional Neural Network,Academia,IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing,conferencePaper,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Supervised learning methods require a large number of labeled image data sets, but a large number of labeled image data sets are difficult to obtain in many practical applications, so it is necessary to develop weakly supervised learning methods. There is no good method for cleaning existing data sets containing false images that can simultaneously filter images with label noise and background noise. This paper presents a new method to solve the problem of image with label noise and background noise in weakly supervised learning, which can clean the wrong image with label noise and background noise. We first used the existing neural network VGG16_BN to extract the features of the image and delete the full connection layer. Then we added an error image automatic screening module to filter out the poor quality images and possible wrong images in priority. The images screened in this part include images with 40%-60% label noise and background noise. It can effectively reduce the screening range of the wrong image. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in the dataset of cat and dog dichoromy in the public dataset. We screened and determined that the dataset contained about 0.8% error images, and designed 200 error images to be screened by the proposed method.

Interactive label cleaning with example-based explanations,Academia,NeurIPS,journalArticle,2021,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,mislabel correction,"We tackle sequential learning under label noise in applications where a human supervisor can be queried to relabel suspicious examples. Existing approaches are flawed, in that they only relabel incoming examples that look ""suspicious"" to the model. As a consequence, those mislabeled examples that elude (or don't undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data and the model with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose CINCER, a novel approach that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of mutually incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example, CINCER identifies a counter-example in the training set that-according to the model-is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks the annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible inconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so to serve as explanations of the model's suspicion, and highly influential, so to convey as much information as possible if relabeled. CINCER achieves this by leveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the counter-examples helps in acquiring substantially better data and models, especially when paired with our FIM approximation.

A Comprehensive Benchmark Framework for Active Learning Methods in Entity Matching,Both,ACM SIGMOD,journalArticle,2020,ML4DC,tabular,entity matching / duplicate removal,"Entity Matching (EM) is a core data cleaning task, aiming to identify different mentions of the same real-world entity. Active learning is one way to address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection latencies by up to 10 without affecting the quality of the model.

A flexible outlier detector based on a topology given by graph communities,Academia,Big Data Research,journalArticle,2020,DC4ML,tabular,outliers detection,"Outlier, or anomaly, detection is essential for optimal performance of machine learning methods and statistical predictive models. It is not just a technical step in a data cleaning process but a key topic in many fields such as fraudulent document detection, in medical applications and assisted diagnosis systems or detecting security threats. In contrast to population-based methods, neighborhood based local approaches are simple flexible methods that have the potential to perform well in small sample size unbalanced problems. However, a main concern of local approaches is the impact that the computation of each sample neighborhood has on the method performance. Most approaches use a distance in the feature space to define a single neighborhood that requires careful selection of several parameters. This work presents a local approach based on a local measure of the heterogeneity of sample labels in the feature space considered as a topological manifold. Topology is computed using the communities of a weighted graph codifying mutual nearest neighbors in the feature space. This way, we provide with a set of multiple neighborhoods able to describe the structure of complex spaces without parameter fine tuning. The extensive experiments on real-world data sets show that our approach overall outperforms, both, local and global strategies in multi and single view settings. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

Time series data cleaning: From anomaly detection to anomaly repairing (technical report),Academia,arxiv,journalArticle,2020,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,error detection/repair,"Errors are prevalent in time series data, such as GPS trajectories or sensor readings. Existing methods focus more on anomaly detection but not on repairing the detected anomalies. By simply filtering out the dirty data via anomaly detection, applications could still be unreliable over the incomplete time series. Instead of simply discarding anomalies, we propose to (iteratively) repair them in time series data, by creatively bonding the beauty of temporal nature in anomaly detection with the widely considered minimum change principle in data repairing. Our major contributions include: (1) a novel framework of iterative minimum repairing (IMR) over time series data, (2) explicit analysis on convergence of the proposed iterative minimum repairing, and (3) efficient estimation of parameters in each iteration. Remarkably, with incremental computation, we reduce the complexity of parameter estimation from O(n) to O(1). Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposal compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

PClean: Bayesian data cleaning at scale with domain-specific probabilistic programming,Academia,Proceedings of Machine Learning Research,journalArticle,2020,ML4DC,tabular,error repair,"Data cleaning is naturally framed as probabilistic inference in a generative model, combining a prior distribution over ground-truth databases with a likelihood that models the noisy channel by which the data are filtered, corrupted, and joined to yield incomplete, dirty, and denormalized datasets. Based on this view, we present PClean, a unified generative modeling architecture for cleaning and normalizing dirty data in diverse domains. Given an unclean dataset and a probabilistic program encoding relevant domain knowledge, PClean learns a structured representation of the data as a relational database of interrelated objects, and uses this latent structure to impute missing values, identify duplicates, detect errors, and propose corrections in the original data table. PClean makes three modeling and inference contributions: (i) a domain-general non-parametric generative model of relational data, for inferring latent objects and their network of latent connections; (ii) a domain-specific probabilistic programming language, for encoding domain knowledge specific to each dataset being cleaned; and (iii) a domain-general inference engine that adapts to each PClean program by constructing data-driven proposals used in sequential Monte Carlo and particle Gibbs. We show empirically that short ( 50-line) PClean programs deliver higher accuracy than state-of-the-art data cleaning systems based on machine learning and weighted logic; that PCleans inference algorithm is faster than generic particle Gibbs inference for probabilistic programs; and that PClean scales to large real-world datasets with millions of rows.

CORDEL: A contrastive deep learning approach for entity linkage,Both,IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),journalArticle,2020,ML4DC,tabular,entity matching / duplicate removal,"Entity linkage (EL) is a critical problem in data cleaning and integration. In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models with hand-curated features, both of which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for EL, called CORDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CORDEL with extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset. CORDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2% on public benchmark datasets. Moreover, CORDEL yields a 2.4% improvement over the current best DL model on the real-world dataset, while reducing the number of training parameters by 97.6%. Copyright  2020, The Authors.

A novel data repairing approach based on constraints and ensemble learning,Academia,Expert Syst. Appl.,journalArticle,2020,ML4DC,tabular,error detection/repair,"Data repairing is an important task in data mining. This paper proposes a novel data repairing approach based on a combination of constraints and ensemble learning. At first, functional dependencies (FDs) are used as constraints to identify inconsistent records. For each FD, all repeated values in the correct records are discovered. After that, noisy attributes in erroneous records are detected using correct records and the repeated values. To correct the detected noises, a supervised ensemble learning model is constructed for each attribute. The ensemble model consists of a Bayes classifier, a decision tree, and a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP). A majority of votes is used as the combination strategy in the ensemble learning model. The proposed approach automatically repairs data without any user interaction. Moreover, the proposed method can detect more than one noise in a record.

Nearest neighbor classifiers over incomplete information: From certain answers to certain predictions,Both,arxiv,journalArticle,2020,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,error detection/repair,"Machine learning (ML) applications have been thriving recently, largely attributed to the increasing availability of data. However, inconsistency and incomplete information are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, and their impact on ML applications remains elusive. In this paper, we present a formal study of this impact by extending the notion of Certain Answers for Codd tables, which has been explored by the database research community for decades, into the field of machine learning. Specifically, we focus on classification problems and propose the notion of ""Certain Predictions"" (CP) - a test data example can be certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of all possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same prediction. We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines whether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the number of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given that general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without assumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP queries can be developed - we show that it is possible to answer both queries in linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds. We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of ""data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML)."" We show that our proposed CPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing techniques in terms of classification accuracy with mild manual cleaning effort.

Similarity-learning information-fusion schemes for missing data imputation,Academia,Knowledge-Based Systems,journalArticle,2020,ML4DC,tabular,imputation,"Missing data imputation is a very important data cleaning task for machine learning and data mining with incomplete data. This paper proposes two novel methods for missing data imputation, named kEMI and kEMI+, that are based on the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for pre-imputation and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for posterior-imputation. The former is a local search mechanism that aims to automatically find the best value for k and the latter makes use of the best k nearest neighbours to estimate missing scores by learning global similarities. kEMI+ makes use of a novel information fusion mechanism. It fuses top estimations through the Dempster-Shafer fusion module to obtain the final estimation. They handle both numerical and categorical features.

HoloDetect: Few-Shot Learning for Error Detection [arXiv],Academia,ACM SIGMOD,journalArticle,2019,ML4DC,tabular,error detection,"We introduce a few-shot learning framework for error detection. We show that data augmentation (a form of weak supervision) is key to training high-quality, ML-based error detection models that require minimal human involvement. Our framework consists of two parts: (1) an expressive model to learn rich representations that capture the inherent syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of errors; and (2) a data augmentation model that, given a small seed of clean records, uses dataset-specific transformations to automatically generate additional training data. Our key insight is to learn data augmentation policies from the noisy input dataset in a weakly supervised manner. We show that our framework detects errors with an average precision of ~94% and an average recall of ~93% across a diverse array of datasets that exhibit different types and amounts of errors. We compare our approach to a comprehensive collection of error detection methods, ranging from traditional rule-based methods to ensemble-based and active learning approaches. We show that data augmentation yields an average improvement of 20 F1 points while it requires access to 3 fewer labeled examples compared to other ML approaches.

Hyperparameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyperparmeter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.

Combining Outlier Detection and Reconstruction Error Minimization for Label Noise Reduction,Academia,IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing,conferencePaper,2019,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Label noise is a common phenomenon when labeling a large-scale dataset for supervised learning. Outlier detection is a recently proposed method to handle this issue by treating the outliers of each class as potential data points with label noise and remove them before training. However, this approach could lead to high false positive rate and hurt the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method to deal with this issue by combining the strength of outlier detection and reconstruction error minimization (REM). The main idea is add a second verification step (i.e., REM) to the outputs of outlier detection so as to reduce the risk of discarding those points which do not fit the underlying data distribution well but with correct label. Particularly, we first find the outliers in each class by a robust deep autoencoders-based outlier detector, through which not only did we get candidate mislabeled data but also a group of well-learned deep autoencoders. Then a reconstruction error minimization based approach is applied to these outliers to further filter and relabel the mislabeled data. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that the proposed method could significantly reduce the false positive rate of outlier detection and improve the performance of both data cleaning and classification in the presence of label noise.","Zhang, WN; Tan, XY; IEEE",PO,YES,,"For goal (1): other approaches that can re-label a dataset (1.1) ICCN-SMO (1.2) TC-SVM (1.3) ALNR (1.4) LN-RDA, for goal (2): robust cleaning approaches and some of (1) solutions",MNIST,mislabels,-,robust auto-encoder,Superior to other methods for almost every level of label noise,Significantly lower than other methods,(1) Accuracy of fixing mislabels (2) perfomance of the end classifier,,,short and sweet,12,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,4,2.0,2.0,-,
Confident learning: Estimating uncertainty in dataset labels,Both,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,journalArticle,2019,"DC4ML, ML4DC",any,mislabel correction,"Learning exists in the context of data, yet notions of confidence typically focus on model predictions, not label quality. Confident learning (CL) is an alternative approach which focuses instead on label quality by characterizing and identifying label errors in datasets, based on the principles of pruning noisy data, counting with probabilistic thresholds to estimate noise, and ranking examples to train with confidence. Whereas numerous studies have developed these principles independently, here, we combine them, building on the assumption of a class-conditional noise process to directly estimate the joint distribution between noisy (given) labels and uncorrupted (unknown) labels. This results in a generalized CL which is provably consistent and experimentally performant. We present sufficient conditions where CL exactly finds label errors, and show CL performance exceeding seven recent competitive approaches for learning with noisy labels on the CIFAR dataset. Uniquely, the CL framework is not coupled to a specific data modality or model (e.g., we use CL to find several label errors in the presumed error-free MNIST dataset and improve sentiment classification on text data in Amazon Reviews). We also employ CL on ImageNet to quantify ontological class overlap (e.g., estimating 645 missile images are mislabeled as their parent class projectile), and moderately increase model accuracy (e.g., for ResNet) by cleaning data prior to training.

Most of the existing algorithms rely on either qualitative techniques (e.g., data rules) or quantitative ones (e.g., statistical methods). In this paper, we present a novel hybrid data cleaning framework on top of Markov logic networks (MLNs), termed as MLNClean, which is capable of cleaning both schema-level and instance-level errors. MLNClean mainly consists of two cleaning stages, namely, first cleaning multiple data versions separately (each of which corresponds to one data rule), and then deriving the final clean data based on multiple data versions. Moreover, we propose a series of techniques/concepts, e.g., the MLN index, the concepts of reliability score and fusion score, to facilitate the cleaning process. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of MLNClean to the state-of-the-art approach in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Data cleansing for models trained with SGD,Academia,NeurIPS,journalArticle,2019,"DC4ML, ML4DC",img,mislabel correction,"Data cleansing is a typical approach used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models, which, however, requires extensive domain knowledge to identify the influential instances that affect the models. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can suggest influential instances without using any domain knowledge. With the proposed method, users only need to inspect the instances suggested by the algorithm, implying that users do not need extensive knowledge for this procedure, which enables even non-experts to conduct data cleansing and improve the model. The existing methods require the loss function to be convex and an optimal model to be obtained, which is not always the case in modern machine learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach specifically designed for the models trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The proposed method infers the influential instances by retracing the steps of the SGD while incorporating intermediate models computed in each step. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately infer the influential instances. Moreover, we used MNIST and CIFAR10 to show that the models can be effectively improved by removing the influential instances suggested by the proposed method. Copyright  2019, The Authors.

Label denoising based on Bayesian aggregation,Academia,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,journalArticle,2017,ML4DC,tabular,mislabel correction,"Label noise is a common problem that affects supervised learning and can produce misleading results. It is shown that only 5% of switched labels lead to a decrease of performances. Therefore, the true class of an instance must be distinguished from its observed label. In the past decade, classification in presence of label noise was the topic of interest. Several scholars focused on kNN-based approaches for data cleansing. These types of approaches often are susceptible to high label noise rate and when a batch of instances with noisy labels are exist they may deteriorate the results. The problem arises since the methods have a local view of instances. Another approach is to have a global view of instances. In a global view, instances with large distance from their respective classes are detected as noisy. A potential problem however is the determination of a threshold. An inappropriate threshold may lead to detection of a correct instance as noisy instance. In this paper a new method for label denoising based on Bayesian aggregation is proposed which solves the problems of kNN-based approaches by aggregating the local and global views of instances. The aggregation of local and global information leads to a more robust and accurate detection of instances with noisy labels and estimation of their true labels. The experimental results show the capabilities and robustness of the proposed method.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bagherzadeh, Parsa; Sadoghi Yazdi, Hadi",Dima,YES,10.1007/s13042-015-0474-y,"IB2, DROP, CCTree, MCTree, WkNN, KDBMS","UCI data sets (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php): BUPA, Ionosphere, Alabone, Pen digits",,Compared approaches are dated from 90ies,SVM with linear kernel,"Precision, Sensitivity, F1",no such performance metrics,Ranking algorithms based on the Friedman test ,,IRWZDJP4,,9,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,4,2.0,2.0,,
Data Improving in Time Series Using ARX and ANN Models,Academia,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,journalArticle,2017,"DC4ML, ML4DC",tabular,error detection/repair,"Anomalous data can negatively impact energy forecasting by causing model parameters to be incorrectly estimated. This paper presents two approaches for the detection and imputation of anomalies in time series data. Autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are used to extract the characteristics of time series. Anomalies are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals, and the anomalous data points are imputed using the ARX and ANN models. Because the anomalies affect the model coefficients, the data cleaning process is performed iteratively. The models are re-learned on “cleaner” data after an anomaly is imputed. The anomalous data are reimputed to each iteration using the updated ARX and ANN models. The ARX and ANN data cleaning models are evaluated on natural gas time series data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed approaches are able to identify and impute anomalous data points. Forecasting models learned on the unclean data and the cleaned data are tested on an uncleaned out-of-sample dataset. The forecasting model learned on the cleaned data outperforms the model learned on the unclean data with 1.67% improvement in the mean absolute percentage errors and a 32.8% improvement in the root mean squared error.

Existing techniques for data cleaning have difficulties with rare cases and outliers in minority class, especially, in highly unbalanced data. The drawback leads incomplete and imprecise examples to removal. In order to enhance the robustness and perform thorough data cleaning, we propose a weighted edited nearest neighbor (WENN), which detects and removes noisy examples from both classes intelligently. It considers individual characteristics of each imbalanced data, involving global class imbalance and local distribution. The main idea of the proposed method is to carefully put more focus on the majority class than the minority class during data cleaning.

Standard approaches like deterministic methods and probabilistic methods are generally used for this purpose. Many new approaches using single layer perceptron, crowdsourcing etc. are developed to improve the efficiency and also to reduce the time of entity resolution. The approaches used for this purpose also depend on the type of dataset, labeled or unlabeled. This paper presents a new method for labeled data which uses single layered convolutional neural network to perform entity resolution. It also describes how crowdsourcing can be used with the output of the convolutional neural network to further improve the accuracy of the approach while minimizing the cost of crowdsourcing.
