# Data
In this directory, we provide all data necessary to replicate our study.

In Section 2 of our paper, we describe the methodology we followed to collect and select papers to include in our study. The following subdirectories provide the papers left after each step of our methodology. The directory name are numbered following the order described in the methodology. The extracted data for each paper included in our study (see Section 2.7) is available in the directories `5.quality _control` and `6.snowballing`.

- `1.paper collection`: The full list of papers we collected from academic datases, excepting GS (see Section 2.4). Each spreadsheet is named based on the academic database the papers come from.
- `2.duplicate removal`: The list of papers after we removed duplicates with our reference management tool (see Section 2.5.1).
- `3.GS_pruning`: The list of GS papers after we apply GS pruning (see Section 2.5.2).
- `4.inclusion_criteria`: The list of papers (from GS and other academic databases) after we apply the inclusion criteria in Section 2.5.3.
- `5.quality _control`: (1) The ratings (using the quality control questions from Section 2.5.4) for each paper left from last step and (2) the ratings of a second researcher for papers excluded in this step by a first researcher.  
- `6.snowballing`: The list of papers added because of snowballing (see Section 2.5.5).
